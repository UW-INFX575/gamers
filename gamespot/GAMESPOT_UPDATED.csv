Josiah Renaudin,26-May-15,Sunset Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sunset-review/1900-6416154/,7,PC,"['In Sunset, you sweep dusty floors, wash spotted windows, and fold a strangers well-pressed, tailored clothes--every week for a full year.', 'These acts might sound routine and tedious, but when youre rooted in the fictional Latin American country of Anchuria during a 1972 military coup, a ritualistic comfort goes along with carefully making a bed or unclogging the upstairs sink. Still, uncertainty lies even within these constants because the man whose house you maintain has ties to the political and cultural turmoil engulfing the streets. Sunset beautifully pairs its dull corners with a sharp, sociopolitical edge, and while its inconsistent pacing and nagging technical hiccups blur the vision, theres an unquestionable beauty in watching the sunset kiss the tips of skyscrapers as another somber day comes to a close.', ""You'll spend Sunset's four-hour run with Angela Burns, an African-American engineer working as a housekeeper to cover her hefty school bills. Angela works for the affluent art collector Gabriel Ortega, whom Angela gets to know solely through his surplus of sculptures and paintings, his eclectic taste in literature, and a series of notes on which you can write personal responses. You become most intimately acquainted with the actual apartment, though, which both subtly and dramatically morphs as the revolution outside its walls progresses. Its a character all its own, and you grow accustomed to its many distinguishing features--such as the deep closet dug into Ortegas bedroom, the neatly prepared chess board in the game room that pines for players, and, maybe most importantly, the wide windows by the patio that act as a thin veil between calm and chaos."", 'How this apartment is decorated and what you do during each in-game hour is up to you. If you feel compelled to go above and beyond the to-do list and hang up pictures of Ortegas accomplishments, you have the option. If you just dont feel up to lifting a finger on a cool September evening, you can simply turn around, open the elevator doors, and call it a night.', 'You do work within boundaries, though. You cant throw a chair in the fireplace or send the grand piano out the window and into the streets (I tried), but the chores youre assigned have variations. Youre given a warm and a cool option when you hover your cursor over a task, which determines whether you want to add some personality to the work or complete the task plainly. You can decorate the second floor with bright, floral wallpaper or slap on whatever drab design Ortega has tucked away in the closet. The material of the rug in front of the fireplace, the color of the fresh coat of paint on the bar walls, the care taken when stitching a patch into a ripped piece of clothing--this system provides a fork in every road. How these decisions affect actual change in the grand scheme of things isnt always clear, but they do act as a silent, day-to-day means of communication between you and Ortega.', 'Much of the storytelling in this first-person experience is visual, but Angelas running monologue provides direct context for each weeks happenings and her current feelings toward Ortega. In addition, Angela can sit on a canvas-wrapped chair located within the apartment at any time to begin scribbling notes into her diary. Beyond questioning Ortegas intentions and worrying for her rebel brothers safety during the conflict, she digs deeper into her interpretation of Ortegas art, the social differences between Anchuria and her hometown of Baltimore, and her place in this unstable country. This is where the superb writing shines brightest, and while the texts sluggish scroll quickly drains precious minutes before the sun sets, its worth your time to drink it all in.', 'Depending on how often you complete tasks and reply to notes with a warm sensibility, a strong romantic bond begins to form between tenant and housekeeper. It starts as an innocent flirtation, but as the revolution escalates, so do their feelings toward one another. And while the passion isnt capped by a nightly embrace and kiss goodbye, watching the unspoken dance grow and evolve into something deeper is satisfying. Its hard to know whether or not its a kinship born from tragedy and stoked by fear, but they find comfort in each others presence--even if that presence isnt physical.', 'For the most part, the deliberate pacing benefits the relationships establishment. However, the steady climb toward a resolution is occasionally broken by days of inactivity and narrative stagnation. More than a few visits feel like filler, with no notes to respond to and few tasks to complete. These periods slowly drag you away from an otherwise compelling story. Sunset excels at using subtlety to build tension and curiosity, but when the progression halts, the activities start to feel like exactly what they are--chores.', 'Running Sunset on higher graphical settings can also be called a chore. Even after experimenting with a handful of different option combinations, I couldnt find a mix that permanently steadied my framerate or prevented hitching. The presentation--from the glamour of the skys often-lavender glow to the dark smoke billowing from the buildings in the distance--is salient but often muddled by technical inconsistency. Its a shame, too, because when Sunset does run smoothly for a visit or two and the powerful, orchestral soundtrack booms across the household, it can be an audiovisual marvel.', 'Sunset presents so much, all while asking you to do so little. A revolution burns, bombs burst just out of sight, and all you can do is decide if your boss would rather have a fancy dinner or a hefty portion of macaroni. The complexity of your decisions is occasionally greater than setting the table, but Sunset succeeds at making each small action feel significant by giving them all similar weight. Though the story is peppered with periods of inactivity that are detrimental to the pace, Sunset acts as a thoughtful, pensive walk through social themes and struggles not often explored in this medium.', ' ', ' ']"Alexa Ray Corriea,26-May-15,Game of Thrones: A Telltale Games Series Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/game-of-thrones-episode-four-sons-of-winter-review/1900-6416153/,5,PC,"['A friend once joked that HBO\'s Game of Thrones should be renamed ""A Series of Meetings,"" given its string of recent episodes featuring more exposition and chatter than action. I\'m applying this moniker to Sons of Winter, the fourth episode of Telltale\'s Game of Thrones, because it marks a departure from the series\' dramatic tension and, unfortunately, is starting to mimic its source material in all-too-predictable ways. That\'s not to say Sons of Winter is without its bright points, however: they come in the form of the episode\'s secondary characters, who unravel their own backstories and add more interesting dilemmas.', ""I've praised the the game's focus on the Forrester family before; they are always the most interesting characters on screen at any given time, overshadowing cameos from the TV show's stars. It's been thoroughly delightful (and painful, in that masochistic, enjoyable way) to watch Mira evolve into a sneaking schemer, to see Rodrik struggle to balance the demands of Lady Forrester and his sister Talia without letting either down, and to uncover the mystery of the fabled North Grove with Gared. But their story is starting to to mimic the tale of the Starks--the downtrodden family at the center of George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire--with the introduction of new characters and scenarios that come across as though detailed on a writer's checklist of necessary plot points. I can't list all those things here, as doing do would spoil nearly every turning point for the episode, but I can say that if you're familiar with the arcs of Sansa Stark and Jon Snow, you will find few surprises here."", 'We last left Gared Tuttle at the Wall in more trouble that he\'s ever been, with Mira out of favor with Margaery Tyrell, with Rodrik trying and failing to regain control of Ironrath, and with Asher at the feet of Daenerys Targaryen. Most of the major choices in Sons of Winter revolve around the heroes trying to please one person at the expense of incurring another\'s wrath--something you\'ve been doing in more exciting, meaningful ways for three episodes already. There\'s a lot of verbal fencing, but none of it reaches anxious heights of, say, Mira\'s first conversation with Cersei Lannister in Episode One. For example, Asher\'s plea to Daenerys to provide an army is rushed and flat, and no matter what you tell her, she continues to threaten you. Having Mira eavesdropping on partygoers and potentially ruin fellow handmaiden Sera\'s life doesn\'t feel thrilling, and threats made towards her are all simple variants of ""You\'ll pay for this!"" and ""We\'ll get you!"" with little bite behind the bark.', 'Sons of Winter is about defense and safety--protecting yourself and your house, and keeping who you can safe. You can\'t keep everyone secure, though, and most decisions are predictable: side with Beshka or with your uncle as Asher, side with Sera (or not) as Mira, side with your mother or with the woman you love as Rodrik. These gambits of ""him or her"" decisions, one after another, have become tiring four episodes in. You have to decide how to use the information you have, who to reveal it to, and with whom to use it as a bargaining chip. You\'ll make people angry, fall further out of favor if you choose to put your family first, and, in one instance, alter someone\'s only chance at having a good life.', ""You're still being pushed to think of your family first, and endanger yourself in the process, but the emotional risks feel just out of sight here, not in the way that you can sometimes be blind to negative consequences, but in a way that you aren't taking time to weigh outcomes because there is no threat to consider. Having those threats simmer at every major choice has served Game of Thrones well in its first half, but Episode Four drops the tension entirely. In Mira's case, for instance, you gather loads of useful information in a short amount of time and are then able to bully and tease others as you please. But by making Mira powerful, much of what made her storyline frightening has been sidelined. Shes playing the Game of Thrones with no immediate consequence."", ""Perhaps this is the part of Game of Thrones when it's time to talk more and do less, to bide time and wait for opportunity. But the episode's overall goal is to introduce more information, more context, and more characters, and not to drop the Forresters directly into harm's way. There's nothing wrong with slowing down, but Sons of Winter slows to a crawl. Telltale's games are at their best when they drop action sequences into unexpected junctures of downtime, thus creating threats that need to be dealt with immediately and quickly before you can proceed. An entire episode of exposition and lock-picking doesn't contribute to the mood-building, especially in Westeros, and the lengthiest action sequence--a string of running into cover, sneaking, and stealthily taking down guards--is devoid of any real stress or excitement."", ""There are a few emotional cling-points in Sons of Winter, and they revolve around the people who are willing to risk life and limb to help the Forresters. Most notable among these are several scenes with Beskha, the brash and cutthroat sellsword who has become Asher's best friend. You finally learn why she's so tough and why she's loath to return to Meereen, and the scene culminates in one of the most heartbreaking moments in the series so far. Her tragedy outweighs Asher's. By revealing her backstory to Asher, he gains some perspective in his relationship with her, which delivers several sweet, enjoyable moments between the two that are welcome amid the episode's low points."", ""It is also refreshing to see Rodrik's struggle against the Whitehills finally move away from the repetitive cycle of events that characterized the series' first half. As the Whitehills realize they aren't as strong or as powerful as they thought, unlikely allies come to Rodrik's aid. These supporting characters bring a refreshing change to the fight we've seen so far, revealing personalities that alternately clash and meld with the Forresters and bring out new, personal facets of their struggle. Rodrik's beloved, Elaena Glenmore, becomes more important in Episode Four than she's been throughout the series, evolving beyond a love interest and perhaps into something more dangerous as she pushes Rodrik to take action on her behalf."", ""A bit about the presence of the TV show characters: Daenerys is totally out of character. She's mean and hard in ways that she isn't in the TV series. In the show, she is firm and always open to listening, but Telltale has made her into a vicious would-be despot. Her scene happens early in the episode and jarred me out of the experience; she didn't fit, her behavior so off that it was harder for me to find my emotional footing for the rest of the episode."", ""As Telltale's Game of Thrones passes its halfway mark, it takes a bit of a dip, staging a set of scenes that feels less like something you can control and more like something you can only passively watch. There's no sense of agency in the choices you are offered; you simply spin a conversation in a certain direction before arriving at a pre-determined outcome. Sons of Winter is set dressing, though the events of its last two minutes are strong enough of a taster to make you hunger for Episode Five. It's a bit disappointing that the rest of the episode doesn't reach the dramatic bar Telltale has already set for itself."", ' ']"Heidi Kemps,22-May-15,Puzzle & Dragons Z + Puzzle & Dragons: Super Mario Bros. Edition Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/puzzle-dragons-z-puzzle-dragons-super-mario-bros-e/1900-6416152/,7,3DS,"['Having played Puzzle & Dragons Z and Puzzle & Dragons: Super Mario Bros. Edition for quite some time now, I get the feeling that these games really werent made for me.', 'Let me elaborate on that statement a bit: I adore the mobile version of Puzzle & Dragons, and have made it a part of my daily gaming routine for a very long time. The prospect of a version devoid of free-to-play trappings such as limited stamina for adventuring, or the premium-monster Rare Egg Machine is naturally exciting. Developers often make substantial changes in game design when making a free-to-play version of a popular game, often to the games detriment; features once seen as a given are now treated as pricey premiums. On the 3DS, P&D Z and P&D Mario represent quite the opposite: they remove some of the features of the free-to-play game, leaving experiences that, while still quite fun, dont quite live up to the ever-changing and growing mobile version.', 'Puzzle & Dragons, for the unfamiliar, is an exceptionally clever mix of match-three puzzling, a collectible card game, and role-playing. You assemble a team of five monsters, complete with a leader, from the horde of dragons, demons, gods, and superhumans youve collected, and then venture into dungeons consisting of sets of enemy encounters. You engage in combat on a 6X5 puzzle board: match three orbs of a particular color, and your monsters of that color attack foes. Unlike in a lot of similar games, you can move a single orb around the whole board for a short time, using it to shift many other orbs and create multiple matches, and thus yield more attacks and attack boosts for your team. Enemies, naturally, hit back when their turns arrive, which is when you focus on matching the healing orbs on the board. With practice, youre launching multiple combos and healing each turn with ease.', 'Its not just puzzle prowess that makes P&D appealing, however: every monster type in the game is unique, with its own statistics, color attributes, and perhaps most importantly, special skills. Leader monsters can employ a passive, always-on leader skill, like increasing the health points of your monsters of the same color, or giving an attack multiplier after a certain number of combos. Active skills are single-use abilities each monster has that you must choose to trigger, with effects like changing one orb type into another, or healing a bit of team health. Awakened skills--seen here only with Mario P&D--are extra, passive skills that can be applied to certain monsters by special means. Weighing considerations like monster types, stats, and skills is crucial to success when building teams. With the right materials earned from dungeon romps, monsters can also evolve and transform. Its this feeling of building and growing a killer squad, along with flaunting your puzzle skills, that makes P&D so tremendously fun and satisfying.', 'While both Puzzle & Dragons Z and Puzzle & Dragons Mario are built on this formula, the two games take very different approaches to presentation. P&D Mario is a full reskin with the Super Mario theme, replacing the fierce gods and towering dragons of mobile P&D with Mario, Luigi, Toad, and a bunch of familiar baddies. P&D Z is also quite different from the mobile game, but in its own way: while it features some of the familiar mobile P&D monsters, its a more kid-friendly, story-driven adventure in which you fight an evil organization that controls the legendary Skydragons and is trying to reshape the world. From a strictly cosmetic standpoint, P&D Z is considerably more appealing: P&D Mario reuses New Super Mario Bros. music and visual assets frequently. Evolving a tiny dragon baby into a huge, hulking god-lizard is leagues more appealing than changing a Blooper into a Blooper, but now with a baby Blooper!', 'But there are more than just cosmetic differences between the two. Lets start with P&D Z: its a fairly old game, having first released in Japan in late 2013, and simplifies the mobile game as it existed at that time, with all single-color-attribute monsters and no awakened skills. It also implements a significant change to the active skill system; instead of monsters each waiting a set number of turns before their skills can be triggered, theres a pool of skill points that can be utilized at any time by any monster, as long as youve got enough points to use a particular skill. P&D Mario feels a lot closer to modern mobile P&D, with things like multi-attribute monsters, skill-up boosts, and awakened skills, along with a more traditional turn-based active skill system.', 'The key difference between both of these games and mobile P&D, however, is the removal of anything associated with the in-app purchases that fuel the mobile versions money machine. Mobile P&D employs a free-to-play standard stamina meter than limits your play time (unless you either wait or pay), but you wont find that here. Your squad gains experience with dungeons in P&D Z and P&D Mario, unlike the mobile game, in which experience is strictly sacrifice-based. (This is an adjustment I really wish would be implemented in the mobile version.) Wiping out in a dungeon doesnt mean you lose everything youve earned: whereas you need to continue (and possible pay) in the mobile game to keep the loot youve earned to that point, the drops you acquire in P&D Z and P&D Mario stick with you whether you decide to bail, or use your one-up stash to keep pressing on.', 'This all sounds pretty great so far, so why dont these games click in the way the mobile version does? For starters, theres the odd difficulty curve. I understand that these games must be sold to people who may not have played P&D on mobile before, but being an experienced orb-slinger, I was terribly bored during the first few worlds of each game, wiping out enemy teams with relative ease. Theres no option to skip all the tutorials and introductory dialogue, either, meaning that no matter which game you choose to play first, youll be hearing a lot of the same advice to get you started. It isnt until about the halfway point in each game that things start to get considerably more challenging, and sometimes in weirdly unfair ways. For instance, you may encounter a no-healing-orbs dungeon at a point where youre not likely to have team members who have a change an orb type to healing active skill.', 'Another major issue is the grind. In mobile P&D, you have sets of dungeons that are centered around earning materials needed to upgrade your monsters, and they rotate on a consistent schedule. If theres something you know you need, you set time and stamina aside on a specific day of the week to do a few dungeon runs for the drops you require (which youre very likely to get). Both P&D Z and P&D Mario lack these, meaning that items (chips in P&D Z; coins and medals in P&D Mario) to upgrade monsters all must be be earned from regular dungeon runs, many of which dont have great drop rates. This leads to a lot of repetition, forcing you to run dungeons where you know a certain monster could appear, usually with disappointment as an end result. A pay in-game currency for random items option appears about halfway through both games, but getting what you want from those is even more of a crapshoot.', 'But perhaps the biggest issue, an unavoidable part of being a prepackaged product, is that the games are woefully static. There are no fun little surprises when you boot the game up, like daily giveaways, new monster and dungeon additions, and limited-time bonuses and areas like in the mobile game. While its easy to cynically see these mobile P&D features as a means to get more money from players as they spend it on extra stamina and Rare Egg Machine rolls, the fact of the matter is that they make the game more interesting and exciting from one day to the next. When youre done with P&D Z and Mario, when youve cleared all the current levels and collected every last type of Paragoomba and Cheep-Cheep, thats all there is to it. But perhaps thats intentional--have no doubt that developer GungHo hopes some players move on to the ever-evolving mobile game when they feel theyve seen everything these two games have to offer.', 'Thats what I mean when I say that this game wasnt made for me. Its a watered-down stepping stone, intended to introduce players to Puzzle & Dragons with a familiar face and none of those intimidating in-app purchases. Its clear, however, that P&Ds design was built on a free-to-play base, and taking those elements out actually makes the game feel less substantial as a result. (Yes, much as we loathe to admit it, its exciting to spend some premium-currency magic stones for a random rare monster from time to time, just as its fun to open a pack of trading cards or a blind-boxed figure.) While you can still have a good deal of fun with this two-in-one package, the mobile game is the better option. P&D Z and P&D Mario make nice little appetizers, but ultimately, its up to you whether you want to feast on the main course afterwards.']"Justin Clark,21-May-15,Schrodinger's Cat and the Raiders of the Lost Quark Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/schrodinger-s-cat-and-the-raiders-of-the-lost-quar/1900-6416151/,5,PS4,"[""Many articles could be written about the idea that the video game mascot--in the Mario/Sonic/Crash Bandicoot/Pikachu sense--is dead, and what that says about where games are as a medium, but suffice it to say, that Schrodinger's Cat and the Raiders of the Lost Quark tries to make a new one is at once endearing and utterly baffling. Of all the aspects of 90s gaming that are being mined for material, that's one I never expected to see make a comeback."", ""In the game's favor, it's a great idea for a mascot-style platformer. On the subatomic level, a particle zoo--a real term used to describe the atomic building blocks of our universe--is used literally here as a bright, colorful cartoon zoo housing quarks, gluons, and the like. One day, security breaks down, Jurassic Park-style, and the zoo's inhabitants get loose. Unable to deal with the sudden chaos, the zoo's director calls in an agent with a particular set of skills: Schrodinger's Cat. You might remember him from such popular quantum states as being alive and dead at the same time."", ' ', ""The particular set of skills the Cat has turns out to be collecting and manipulating quarks to create completely new tools to traverse the environment. The science is rather cleverly on point here. There are four different types of quarks running around: Up, Down, Construction, and Destruction; each type is assigned to a shoulder button. Pressing them in combinations of three creates a different effect, just like they create protons in reality. Three Ups create a tiny helicopter. Three Downs create a drill that breaks through floors. Three Constructions create a giant bubble shield; three Destructions create a fragile platform to stand on. The 12 possible combinations are mostly left to the player to discover. It's a fun bit of trial and error to find all the different options, which are wisely shown in a little reference guide when you pause the game. A few too many are different permutations of this helps you go up, but when you start running out of components, the options for a creative alternative are nice."", ""It's an imaginative mechanic that feels like it belongs on a current gen system. The problem is that the rest of the game is absolutely committed to being a 90s mascot platformer in every other respect, complete with the Cat himself being given obnoxious, oft-repeated catchphrases, like Scienceariffic! and yelling Holy Higgs! when he dies. Schrodinger's Cat is, ultimately, the more ThinkGeek-y cousin of Bubsy The Cat, to the point where I bet a friend that What could possibly go wrong? was coming. The references to famous physicists and physics terms start off as cute, but they quickly become ubiquitous, obvious, and awkwardly shoehorned into the narrative. Non-player characters serve the same function, offering hints and clues to the next objective but burying those hints neck deep in references to the Higgs Boson and combinant theory at every turn. The script is less concerned with showing and playing with the physics concepts (in the way that Psychonauts utilized psychology) and more concerned with showing off the fact that yes, the designers clearly went to college. It's exclusionary nerdery at its worst."", ' ', 'Even as a game, however, it is trying to serve two masters at once. Two types of levels are seen here. The best are pre-planned puzzle levels with a limited number of quarks to use, quark-stealing gluons scattered about, and the need to do some tricky platforming. Faint glimmers of greatness occur here--if you run out of the type of quark you need for the easy solution, you have to think creatively to use the quarks you do have. You have plenty of ways to get vertical in a level, but having the ability to explode a wall in just the right way to proceed and saving enough quarks to do so is a different story. The worst levels, on the other hand, are procedurally generated, awkwardly designed obstacle courses that rely far too much placing nondescript destructible walls in your way rather than creating a surmountable challenge.', ""Both types suffer from a severe lack of variety in environments and enemies for a platformer, and seeing the subatomic world undulating in the background doesn't cut it. It doesn't take long for the game to show you virtually everything it has to offer. The actual mechanics of running, jumping, crawling, and clawing are just fine, but the mad genius platformer where you get to test any of those skills is missing. All we get in return is a gimmick in which you can create a special net out of your available quarks to cart the ones you knock unconscious away, making the job of the zoo's staff a lot easier. It's neat the first hundred times, but its not nearly enough. You have to do way too much of it to feel a sense of accomplishment; you also have to do it while walking in the irksome paws of a sentient episode of The Big Bang Theory. The game turns a fresh, fascinating new mechanic using particle physics as a creative springboard into the most staid, stale platformer imaginable. If the goal was to create a game that's both alive and dead at the same time--mission accomplished.""]"Janine Hawkins,20-May-15,Stretchmo Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/stretchmo-review/1900-6416150/,7,3DS,"['It\'s tempting to launch into a ""fans of the genre"" preamble when it comes to Stretchmo, the latest in a series of block-pulling puzzle games for the 3DS. However, that would be selling it short. There\'s little risk that players who enjoyed Pushmo and Crashmo won\'t find more of the same appeal waiting for them here. Because it is ""free-to-start,"" Stretchmo is even more approachable than either, making it a suitable starting point whether you have experience with the series or not.', '""Free-to-start"" is a wonderfully upfront term, but it doesn\'t suit any other game on the Nintendo 3DS eShop as well as it does Stretchmo. Let me clear something up right away: if you expect from Stretchmo a familiar free-to-play game structure with actions, timers, and assorted currencies that can be exchanged for one another, you will either be very disappointed or very relieved. The same can be said if you come to it after having played Pokemon Rumble World or Pokemon Shuffle, which were both released earlier this year under the same free-to-start banner. You are given access to seven tutorial levels in Stretchmo that explain the game\'s basic mechanics for free, but unlocking everything else requires a transaction. While you can happily spend hours plucking away at the content in Pokemon Rumble World and Pokemon Shuffle without paying a cent, Stretchmo is more like a supremely limited game demo by comparison--with only a few minutes of play time available, for that matter. You dont even have access to camera rotation in these early levels, a feature that becomes absolutely crucial in solving the more complicated puzzles that come later on. You can at least rewind, which comes in handy after accidentally (and inevitably) tumbling down from somewhere precarious.', 'These arent necessarily bad things in this free-to-start venture. Stretchmo is much truer to the term ""free-to-start"" than some of the other games that share the descriptor, but expectations may need to be adjusted accordingly. Stretchmo is best thought of along the lines of the Picross e series--a relatively accessible puzzle game broken up into manageable chunks with even more manageable price tags attached to each one.', ""Pushmo, Crashmo, and Stretchmo (known in Europe as Pullblox, Fallblox, and Fullblox, respectively) are all about manipulating structures built from various Tetris-like blocks to reach a goal, and each game has changed the rules of this manipulation to stand on its own. As Stretchmo's name implies, the primary way of interacting with blocks is by stretching them from the front, back, or either side. A thoughtfully stretched block path allows you to climb up to the goal, whether it's a flag or a sickeningly cute little baby blob character that's been trapped. In the purchasable level packs, youre introduced to a variety of gadgets that have various effects when triggered; they may shoot a platform out, stretch a block in every direction, or provide you with a tunnel to get past an otherwise insurmountable obstacle. Most of these gadgets are drawn from previous games, and they add a little mechanical variety to keep things interesting."", ""As for the level packs, the game encourages you to complete them in order as they increase in difficulty, but because each pack starts with a refresher on some of the most basic Stretchmo strategies, there's no reason for a confident player not to stray. Whether or not you're a veteran of the series, however, youll ultimately find twists that appeal to you. For example, while the Mallo's Playtime Plaza level pack is very simple and straightforward, in Corin's Fortress of Fun, the gadgets you encounter primarily release enemies who are used to climb to the goal and that can attack you and send you back to the start of the level. It's much more action-oriented than the other areas of the game, and it provides a good challenge, not to mention a good change of pace."", ""When you run out of puzzles, you always have the option to create a few levels of their own or scan QR codes to load user-made levels. The downside of this system can be finding those QR codes in the first place--especially if you don't feel like wading through Miiverse comment after Miiverse comment about Stretchmo's pricing to find them. The lack of an online level gallery certainly doesn't help, especially given the fact that the WiiU's Pushmo World had one. It's a firm step backward in a game otherwise full of small (but respectable) steps forward."", ""Stretchmo is as solid and endearing as the games that have come before it in the series; it's cute, colorful, and the perfect puzzle game to keep on your 3DS for dull commutes. It inherits all the best parts of Pushmo and Crashmo and bundles them up in a package (or rather, a series of packages) that is well suited to anyone, regardless of their series experience. Although it may not offer a groundbreaking change in the series, it distinguishes itself enough to be joyful in its own right.""]"Leif Johnson,20-May-15,Technobabylon Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/technobabylon-review/1900-6416149/,8,PC,"[""When the going gets tough, the tough sometimes take a fishing pole and start fishing in a bloody Jacuzzi stuffed with a mutilated body. That's, at least, the lesson you learn in Technobabylon, a point-and-click adventure that's set in 2087 in a city where a powerful AI controls and observes all. It's a cyberpunk quest with ideas that elevate it above cliche, using clever and (mostly) logical puzzles to keep you entertained for hours."", 'This kind of material usually runs the risk of slipping into tired homages to Neuromancer seasoned with a dash of Blade Runner, but Technobabylon rejuvenates the formula by shifting the focus. Here, you spend much of your time in the guise of Doctor Regis, a member of the Central AI\'s police force that\'s sent out to handle all the things that need an actual body. He may have a penchant for covering monitoring cameras in his office, and he may dislike contemporary technology, but he\'s very much a part of the system. Still, the genre\'s tendencies toward loners and outsiders reveals itself here as well, although it\'s largely limited to Latha Sesame, who spends her sad days wired to a Matrix-like ""Trance"" while her crummy apartment and recycled paper clothes rot around her.', ' ', 'Much as in Game of Thrones, the story benefits from shifts in perspective between these and other characters. Knowing the truth about how a particular event played out, for instance, makes it all the more difficult to control the actions of a character who places the blame and motives elsewhere.', ""This is heavy stuff, and Technobabylon has the good sense not to take itself too seriously. The splashes of humor tend to appear in some of the game's toughest (or at least most time-consuming) puzzles, where they serve as a nice chaser to the frustration that comes with matching incorrect inventory items or not knowing what to do with that goo that's in your pocket. The script smartly recalls past secondary references and repurposes them for new and often humorous effects, and at one point, a character's grating silliness actually becomes a clue."", ""As a result, Technobabylon feels like a real world, mixed with as much mirth as menace. Even the dystopia isn't as bleak as what you'll find in the likes of Shadowrun; for better or worse, it presents a generally believable picture of what life would be like toward the end of the century. True to the zeitgeist, Technobabylon even sneaks in exploratory conversations regarding sexuality and spirituality, but they're never heavy-handed or superfluous. Like so much of Technobabylon, it simply is. These elements come together to make the few choices encountered feel more meaningful, although the events reach the same basic outcomes regardless of the means it took to get there."", ""The game depicts these events so capably that I find myself half-forgetting that developer Wadjet Eye drenched the whole project in a pixelated aesthetic that seems better suited to The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past than the futuristic landscape where the action takes place. The strong voice acting generally helps, as do the expressive conversation windows. (However, as a Texan, I laughed when two characters claimed they could recognize each others' Texas accents. Doctor Regis sounds more like Regis Philbin than anyone I've ever met in my neck of the brush.) It's a simple and increasingly outworn style, but there are stunning shots here nonetheless, such as when the camera rushes up the side of a skyscraper to peek through a hole in a shattered window. People and objects are well-crafted but just blurry enough to make the imagination do the right amount of legwork, and sound effects often pull the weight for what the visuals can't achieve."", ""It's worth mentioning that, strictly speaking, Technobabylon isn't an entirely new game--its DNA reveals the vestiges of shorter freeware episodes released earlier in the decade. The art style has improved, however, and the mini-games from that era are mercifully gone, but the basic puzzling remains much the same, even if it serves different purposes for the new storyline. This is generally a good thing, as it's given Wadjet Eye the time to clean up cumbersome elements. Some of the associated problems with pointing and clicking remain, however, such as in a room where I had to grab a table's edges and pull it across the room. Minutes passed before I realized that something so simple as the table's edges existed, and then I had to endure the mildly tedious chore of searching for just the right pixels to grab them."", ""Fortunately, the puzzles themselves tend to find a sweet spot that delivers the right degree of challenge, and the character commentary that pops up when clicking on an item in your inventory or the world wisely makes up for the absence of a hint option. (Or, at least, I don't think there's one. It seemed like there might be hints in the developer commentary, but it repeatedly crashed the entire window every time Wadget Eye CEO Dave Gilbert finished his introduction.) While Technobabylon places a heavy emphasis on picking up objects and using them on something else, it never floods you with items. Many of the game's best ah-ha moments happen when you stop clicking on items in the world and play with matching items in your inventory, which suddenly opens solutions where there previously seemed to be none."", ""That's not to say that I didn't get stuck. Quite the contrary--I can recall at least four incidents when I couldn't progress for an hour or more, but to the game's credit, it usually sprang from some mistake of my own. I once wasted 30 minutes thinking that I was supposed to throw a sheet over a camera, for instance, and (in a slightly more UI-blameworthy mistake), I didn't realize that a certain object wasn't working in my inventory because I hadn't right-clicked on it. Up until then, left-clicking had sufficed for inventory-related items."", ""Regardless, I consistently enjoyed Technobabylon. The puzzles are always meaningful, and the story proves that you can teach the aging dog of cyberpunk some new tricks. At times, I found myself genuinely surprised by story developments; at others, I marveled that it kept me smiling through rough patches when another game might have had me switching it off and playing Skyrim out of spite. And when a game can explore issues of sexuality and government surveillance while giving you a plausible reason to use a fishing pole at a crime scene, that's pretty all right.""]"Alexa Ray Corriea,20-May-15,Life is Strange Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/life-is-strange-episode-three-review/1900-6416147/,8,Xbox One,"['With Chaos Theory, its most recent episode, Life is Strange is beginning to straddle the line between the predictable and the unexpected. I felt like I knew what was going on, but after two hours of sifting through puzzles and dialogues, after I was so sure about what was coming next, Life is Strange flipped everything it has established on its head, making me think the next episode will introduce a radically different game.', ""It's hard to critique what happens in Chaos Theory without spoiling some significant plot points, for both this episode and the previous one, Out of Time. How others interact with protagonist Max Caulfield and what she sees as she wanders Blackwell campus will differ drastically depending on the ending you achieved in Episode Two. The tone is either heartbreakingly somber or surreally uplifting as Max is treated like the town hero. There's a moment where she's allowed to reflect on all that, free from the squiggly hand-written arrows indicating environment objects to interact with, that becomes one of the episode's more poignant moments depending on how patient you are. She either feels lost or invisible, and the intensity of her feelings--the intensity of this moment--brings to light how meaningful the choices you've been making really are."", ""Until now, you've been guiding Max, with her unexplainable time-rewinding powers, on a quest to find missing girl Rachel Amber and expose the weird conspiracy surrounding Arcadia Bay. At the same time, you're helping her navigate her relationship with Chloe, her troubled childhood best friend. Episode Three makes you question, for the first time in Life is Strange, just how much good Max is actually doing by screwing with time. If you thought Episode Two's ending was harrowing, the latter third of Episode Three is even more devastating. It's a negative emotional payoff, but a strong one worth chasing nonetheless."", 'Chaos Theory is also where Life is Strange begins to show its Twin Peaks DNA; you can even find the words ""fire walk with me"" scratched on a mirror in the diner\'s bathroom. If the Pacific Northwest setting and mystery surrounding a girl and her secrets a la Laura Palmer weren\'t a tip-off, Max\'s journey begins to resemble that of Agent Dale Cooper as she struggles to connect the dots between what people are and are not saying. Things are getting weirder and you spend most of the episode talking, rewinding time, and talking again, plumbing cops and fellow students for information on Rachel\'s disappearance and the town\'s not-so-secret drug ring.', 'These intricacies of conversation are interesting, and when you aren\'t talking, you\'re exploring. I\'m genuinely surprised by the amount of smaller side-actions you can choose to complete in Chaos Theory. As you search for items needed to advance the story, you can stop to look at photos, snoop through laptops, and examine objects, and in some of these cases you can actually alter these objects. For example, you can alter the guest list for an exclusive party or retrieve Chloe\'s gun. The environment is populated with small pieces of character development, post-it notes and photos that show whom Arcadia Bay\'s residents really are, and you can spend a sizable chunk of time getting lost examining them all. One fetch quest in Episode Three revolves around David, Chloe\'s ""step-douche,"" and the mementos of his life Max finds both humanize him and make him frightening in ways previous episode have not.', 'Life is Strange\'s strengths lie in littering your path with beautiful scraps of people\'s lives, but its weaknesses lie in the aforementioned fetch quests. Episode Three uses the same kind of retrieval puzzles that dragged down the momentum of Episode Two: stopping the story to grope in the dark for bomb ingredients or scouring a house top to bottom for eggs can be tedious and breaks the heightened tension of a very well-constructed episode. The solutions to these puzzles may be a little on the obtuse side; in the search for eggs I mentioned above, you find them in a place that is not logical and that doesn\'t make sense in the context of the scene. These sections still feel out of place and too ""gamey"" for what developer Dontnod is trying to accomplish emotionally throughout the rest of the episode.', ""Fetch quests aside, the environmental puzzles in Episode Three make more frequent use of Max's powers. You rewind time to sneak away from teachers and security guards, bypass locked doors, and turn the tables by bullying one of the characters threatening the girls. The time-rewinding mechanic is given a brilliant chance to shine; rather than stuff it into situations so Max can show off or amuse Chloe, it is implemented in smart ways that make it feel like a natural fit. After two episodes of wiring players to think about time travel as an extra tool in their pocket, Chaos Theory is finally using it in both big and small meaningful ways. "", ""As Max gets braver and more confrontational, her relationship with Chloe begins to strengthen. Chaos Theory shows two young women in a radically different relationship than in the first episode. Their reminiscing on the past becomes fonder, their interactions warmer. Life is Strange consistently nails the odd, unexplainable way young women become best friends and how they treat each other; even Chloe's occasional roughness as she attempts to guilt Max for leaving her shows the sincerity of her affection for her old friend. Max is also comfortable calling Chloe out on her more aggressive, rude behavior, but now Chloe is willing to own up to it. These two have grown into their own, and watching them race through a quad holding hands reminded me of those weird, wonderful teenage years with my own best friend. Their relationship is finally blooming, and Dontnod supports this growth with heartfelt dialogue and a handful of very touching scenes between the two."", ""It's such a shame, then, that Dontnod ruins this tenderness by shoving in a ham-fisted moment suggesting Max and Chloe may be, or become, more than just friends. The moment is fleeting, awkward, jarring, and is only brought up once more in the episode by Max, with no response from Chloe. There is no lead up to this, no fade in or fade out of the moment; it happens, and then goes away."", ""In some scenes, characters stare at each other with lifeless eyes. There's a scene between Chloe and Max in which the script drops its silly teenager speak and becomes an emotional high point in the pair's relationship arc. It's sweet, and the two say a lot by saying very little. However, while they are talking, they are staring past each other with vacant zombie eyes. This has been present in previous episodes, with some scenes featuring characters that look dead-eyed, but it's in Episode Three that it becomes a real moment-killer."", ""Beyond the mood-breaking fetch quests and blank stares, however, Life is Strange has finally come into its own in Episode Three, shedding some dialogue and pacing problems from previous episodes. Max takes several big gambles and is now paying her dues, the full potential of her power realized in one terrifying day. Despite her growing bravery, she is becoming exhausted, and Dontnod is doing an excellent job of conveying to you, the player, just how much things are grinding on her. You feel the story's turning point like a knife to the ribs as Chaos Theory comes to a close, and the slow reveal of the potential of Max's powers is surprising and devastating. Max's goals, balancing a personal life and solving a mystery, have finally funneled into the same path, and with the entire story left turned on its head, there's no way to tell where things are going.""]"Britton Peele,20-May-15,Swords & Soldiers II Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/swords-and-soldiers-2-review/1900-6416148/,7,Wii U,"['Military skirmishes are never two-dimensional affairs. There is always a lot of politics involved, of course, but on a more primal level, there are concerns like unit formation and attack direction to command your attention--elements that most real-time strategy games try to emulate in one way or another when they depict war. Swords & Soldiers II does away with most of that unit management, boiling the RTS formula down to some of its barest essentials and leaving you with a deceptively simple side-scrolling strategy game. Imagine Age of Empires, flatten it against a cave wall, cut the time of most matches down to 10 minutes or less, and sprinkle in an array of character names that double as puns.', ""Every battle in Swords & Soldiers II is a duel between two armies--one on the left side of the map and one on the right. Whenever you send out a combat unit from your base (whether its a slow but strong melee unit, an agile ranged unit, or something else entirely), that unit travels in a straight line toward the enemy's base until it encounters resistance. With rare exceptions, you have no real control over a unit's movement--most of the games controls center on buying soldiers, not commanding them. You can't tell a unit to stop, you cant tell it to ignore an enemy, you can't command it to shift focus ... it simply moves toward its goal, destroying everything in its way or dying in the attempt."", ""As you play through the game's stages, you are steadily introduced to units and spells from each faction."", ""Since you can't manage exactly when and where your troops will go, resource management is key. Swords & Soldiers II keeps this simple: you purchase most units with gold, and on most maps, you collect it from a mine located right next to your home base--no exploring required. The mine's supply of funds is infinite, so as long as you don't allow your worker units to die, you can easily maintain a steady supply of income. The only other resource you have to keep an eye on is mana, which dictates when you can use the various spells at your disposal. Typically, mana trickles in slowly but steadily, though there are ways to earn mana more quickly if you're proactive about accumulating it. For example, blocks of gold or mana occasionally parachute down from the heavens, which you can send a worker out to collect."", ""Both gold and mana are important, but spells in particular often shift the tide of battle. They are your most direct way of influencing the action, like the hand of a god throwing down a bolt of lightning or cursing its enemies with fear. Unleashing the right spell at the right time can throw a major wrench into your opponent's plans. Say, for instance, that the other player has just sent a large group of fast-moving enemies your way. This could be devastating for your much smaller force if you simply allow the opposing units to duke it out head-to-head, but a properly placed blizzard spell can temporarily stop the entire cluster of enemies in its tracks, giving your own warriors time to whittle them down. Other times, success comes down to countering your opponent with a properly matched army. Is she sending flying units your way? Then dont lean too heavily on your short-range berserkers."", 'All of this can be done with quick and easy touch controls on the Wii U GamePad, though this method means that you spend your entire time looking at the GamePads screen rather than the TV. If youd rather, you can play with an analog stick and button control scheme that swaps a command bar at the top of the screen for radial menus assigned to the Wii Us ZL and ZR buttons. You may lose a bit of speed when selecting units this way, but its a comfortable and easy-to-use setup.', ""You only have to worry about the opposing army coming at you from a single direction, but that doesn't mean that you never lose track of what's going on. Because a complex battle is being flattened to 2D, there is usually a lot happening on the screen, making it easy to be overwhelmed by the action. Thankfully, Swords & Soldiers II's vibrantly chunky, fantastical art makes most of the game's units visually distinctive from one another at a quick glance. (Granted, it helps that there aren't too many units in the first place. Each faction has less than a dozen, not including spells and towers.)"", 'Swords & Soldiers II boils the RTS formula down to some of its barest essentials and leaves you with a deceptively simple side-scrolling strategy game.', ""If you played the first Swords & Soldiers, most of these details are familiar, though in this case, familiarity does not breed contempt. It's been several years since the beloved original game was released, and this sequel is much improved not just in visual terms (it's a much better-looking game than its predecessor), but also in regards to campaign structure."", ""The original game was separated into multiple short campaigns, each focused on one of the game's factions. Swords & Soldiers II instead has a single campaign that tells one large, unbroken story. As you play through the game's stages, you are steadily introduced to units and spells from each faction--such as the Vikings' snowstorm or the demons' skeleton-generating tower--allowing you to get a good grasp of all the game's strategic options without being overwhelmed right from the start. Intriguingly, those units are often mixed and matched throughout the campaign. A Persian Sand Witch can fight alongside a demonic Naga while being defended by a Viking guard tower, leading to greater variety in your potential strategies."", 'This ability to create your own custom faction carries forward into the game\'s skirmish mode. Perhaps you have played StarCraft and thought, ""I really like playing as the Terrans, but it would be awesome if I had access to that one Protoss unit. Swords & Soldiers IIs response to that question is to invite you to build a dream team. Unfortunately, you arent able to show off that team to too many people. While Swords & Soldiers II has a great local two-player mode in which one player uses the Wii U GamePad\'s screen and the other player uses the TV, there is no online multiplayer mode. You can play against AI opponents of varying difficulty, but the AI is no substitute for a devilish human opponent.', ""In fact, if you don't have people nearby to skirmish with, there's not a lot to keep you coming back to Swords & Soldiers II once you've finished the relatively brief (about four- or five-hour) campaign. There are bonus objectives and timed challenges to go for in each mission if you're a completist, but not much in the way of extra, replayable content. Yet Swords & Soldiers II is still impressive, bringing the depth of any properly balanced RTS to a two-dimensional plane. If youve got a few hours to kill, its campaign provides great strategic opportunities. And if youve got a friend nearby, you could be skirmishing for a long time to come.""]"Jeremy Signor,18-May-15,Wolfenstein: The Old Blood Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wolfenstein-the-old-blood-review/1900-6416146/,7,PC & PS4,"[""At several different points during Wolfenstein: The Old Blood, you encounter spots where B.J. Blazkowicz can fall asleep, prompting dream sequences that stick the modern, polygon-constructed B.J. into various levels of Wolfenstein 3D, complete with low-resolution graphics and flat sprites. Functionally, it plays almost identically to the original, but vestigial bits from the modern day, like vertical aiming, stand out, especially if you clearly remember experiencing Wolfenstein 3D for the first time. Also, the game's use of sprites gives it a similar feel to a shooting gallery where you get to walk around and explore. It's a stark reminder of how far the series--and games in general--have come. The same can be said of The Old Blood as a whole, and although it stumbles attempting to reconcile old and new thematically, its varied encounters deliver the primitive thrill of clearing a room in a hail of bullets and blood."", ""If this sounds familiar, it's because Wolfenstein: The New Order did the same thing by juxtaposing B.J., an old-school shooter protagonist out of time, with modern first-person shooter design sensibilities. The Old Blood is a lot less subtle about it, though by necessity. Set before B.J. gets his head injury and goes into the coma that leads to his involvement in The New Order, The Old Blood reunites him with the setting that made him famous: Castle Wolfenstein itself. The first part of the game involves infiltrating the castle in order to find the location of the Nazi headquarters. B.J. is more in his element in the World War II setting, and though there's still advanced technology, it's more in line with what you'd expect from pulp Nazi superscience for the era--much like Wolfenstein 3D's level of technology, in fact. The game practically hits you over the head with parallels to the past: the attack dogs, the giant robot you face right at the beginning of the third chapter, the secret areas you find."", ""And yet we still see the same thoughtful modern design implemented in last year's The New Order interlaced with the callbacks to days past. Firing guns feels both effortless and flexible, with each weapon boasting distinct modes for different situations (such as the assault rifle's automatic and semi-automatic modes), as well as dual-wielding options. Instead of just setting you loose in a sprawling level as you shoot at flat enemies, The Old Blood ebbs and flows as it constantly changes up each encounter's focus, creating an excellent sense of pacing. Action-packed shooting sequences couched in open, cover-laden levels alternate with more freeform stealth sections that don't object to you taking a more direct approach. There are even portions where you're encouraged to run rather than fight. Tying the level design together is some seriously great enemy AI, who intelligently flank you and take cover, yet are not so smart that you can't use cover to outmaneuver them. Everything about the way The Old Blood plays exemplifies the diversity of modern FPS design, and the game does so in a way that's on point and fun."", ""The Old Blood also illustrates where we're going in games and what we're leaving behind. Yes, you still have to fight past dogs, but they also happen to be wearing dog-sized body armor that you can harvest, and instead of coming at you at a crawl, they realistically rocket towards you and tackle you as they try to shred your meat to bits. Yes, you still fight a giant armored super soldier in the third chapter, but when you do defeat it, more troops come pouring out and you're forced to weave in and out of the foyer you just fought in, giving the level new dimensions. And those secret areas? You no longer have to press up against every wall in a level, mashing the confirm button hoping to reveal a sliding wall. Instead, there really are secret areas that can be found through normal exploration. It's amazing to see how design has become both more simplified and more complicated over the years."", ' ', ""We also see shades of a somewhat self-aware industry attempting to look at the past through a different lens. B.J.'s local contact, Kessler, is a stark contrast to the burly protagonist. Ever-defiant in the face of a Nazi-ruled future, Kessler and his late love fight for a Germany that rises up against the hateful regime, with his weapon of choice being leaflets rather than guns. He's also acutely sympathetic towards human life: in one memorable exchange he implores B.J. to avoid killing as many people as he can, which B.J. then willfully misinterprets to mean that he should kill as many Nazis as he can, a sentiment he emphasizes every chance he gets. We also see more fleshed-out versions of enemy combatants, albeit only through memos and a scene where you walk through a bar crowded with Nazi soldiers. We get glimpses of soldiers who still display care and affection for their families at home, even as they become upset because their lovers are dismayed at how the war has changed them, feel fear at the many occult studies and phenomenon they're being focused on, and buy into all the propaganda that litters this world. Even Helga Von Schabbs, the antagonist of the game, is granted some character development in her lifelong fascination with adventure and her potentially royal lineage."", ""Even so, B.J. still sees them as the same flat characters as he sees in his dreams, good for only one thing: killing. The game's mechanics almost never encourage you to leave any Nazis alive. Quite the opposite, in fact. In the end, this is a blunt, muscular, bare-chested romp through levels full of deadly moving targets, even during its subtle moments. As a dumb action game, The Old Blood has the chops. But it fumbles when it attempts to introduce gray areas into the game. Whether it's Kessler's empathy or the supplementary notes you find, The Old Blood seems to have something to say about the evolution of games, but never arrives at a solid point. The sledgehammer that is B.J.'s philosophy always wins out, stranding the gray areas in a game that clearly won't give them the time of day."", ' ', ""Then again, maybe games haven't changed as much as we like to think. The second half of The New Blood changes up enemy types by replacing fully functional Nazis, the default enemy type of the old era, with zombies, the go-to foe of the modern one. It's initially a nice change of pace from the terse shooting arenas that came before, but it's hard not to think of them as a downgrade, turning a mechanically-smart dumb action game into a brain dead one. Don't get me wrong: mowing down zombies with a sawed-off shotgun is a classic scenario, but the waves and waves of corpses pouring at you can't help but feel disappointing after you've experienced the smart design of part one."", ""Clearly MachineGames has big ambitions and understands the nuance that can be evoked in the medium. And The Old Blood certainly displays intelligent action FPS design that's fun and effortless to play. Just don't expect the deep examination the game hints at to go anywhere. Here, the gloriously dumb (yet smartly designed) reigns. Progress can wait. Long live The Old Blood.""]"Daniel Starkey,14-May-15,Galactic Civilizations III Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/galactic-civilizations-iii-review/1900-6416145/,8,PC,"[""It's difficult to wrap your head around how large the universe is. It's one thing to say that the distance from the here to the moon is ten times the circumference of the Earth, but that figure is incomprehensible. It's hard enough to wrap our tiny minds around the notion that our planet, our home, is finite, much less the preposterous distances between the stars. Galactic Civilizations III understands and fluently wields those disparate perspectives--the mundane and human as well as the astronomical--to craft a game that manages to bring the tiniest shuttlecraft, the mightiest quasar, and all the distant mysteries that lie between into a single coherent vision."", ""As you might suspect from the name, Galactic Civilizations is a game that, while inspired by Sid Meier's seminal masterpiece, Civilization, opts for the cosmos as its stage. Matching the stellar scope is the potential to have up to 128 additional players. That alone should give any fan of the strategy game genre pause. For most games of its type, such massive games would bog themselves down in micromanagement, construction, and empire maintenance. But Galactic Civilization III's greatest strength is its ability to manage its momentum. Play starts quickly, with everyone having enough resources at the outset to begin crafting a basic strategy. There's no waiting around for your first few workers here; instead, you can buy up some colony ships, kick-start your military, or roll out some research labs to start cranking out PhDs."", ""After that initial burn, it's a couple dozen more turns before you have quite so many decisions to make. You can use that down time to secure what you have and develop your territory, design some custom ships, or fine-tune your government to suit your most pressing goals. After a bit, you have another burst brought on by a new technology allowing your ships greater range from their home planet or a new pile of credits to be spent on supercharging development."", 'Galactic Civilizations follows this pattern of punctuated equilibrium until the end of the game--regardless of which specific strategy or victory condition you\'re seeking. It helps guide and reinforce the infamous ""one more turn""-style play that 4X games are known for, as well, as you never know when that next burst will hit. You could find some special resource that, if tapped, could unlock a new prototype hyperdrive. That, in turn, can get your colonists to the next star system over, where a new planet and new resources lie waiting. As soon as you\'ve mastered what you own and what you know, you\'ll face a fresh batch of challenges.', ""The burst-secure-develop-burst loop also solves one of the genres longest-running problems--militaristic powers. As with any proper 4X game, Galactic Civilizations has a variety of win conditions. You can be elected the leader of the galaxy, you can ascend to a new plane of existence, or you can steam-roll your opponents with the biggest, baddest ships around. The caveat here is that it's rare that you'll encounter someone whose war machines completely outclass your own. Expansion requires a great deal of investment in engineering and supply chains. Supporting dreadnoughts far from any habitable planets requires chains of star bases or advanced life support systems--both of which can take resources away from a massive military campaign. Military victories are still possible, but blocking off large chunks of the map to the people with the most advanced technology or those that can daisy-chain supply lines keeps anyone's fun from ending prematurely or without proper warning."", ""In creating this cycle, Galactic Civilizations encourages careful, directed thinking. You always want to be in control of your next boon, ready to capitalize on the next step out, no matter where that leads. Thought and investment are rewarded. When you colonize a new planet, the order and placement of the buildings and projects you undertake will determine their effectiveness. Placing factories adjacent to a refinery will boost both their output. Tourism centers next to ports will yield dividends. It's not about doing everything you can but about efficient use of the space you have. The production of new ships and star bases is also decoupled from planetary improvements. Instead, you can assign several planets to support a shipyard. Any manufacturing output dedicated to military development will go to building new weapons. Colony ships and troop transports for invasions will pull population from contributing planets as well. This too emphasizes the cyclic pace. Hooking a few planets up to a dry dock won't net you much until they've been built up with appropriate factories, academies, and the like. But in a few short turns, you'll have a mega factory that can turn out battlecruisers with ease, and then you're ready for your next expansion."", ""If it sounds like I'm placing a lot of emphasis on that loop, it's because Galactic Civilizations forces you to view it through that narrow lens. This is strange, indeed, in no small part because it is a game about the bigness of galactic warfare, about the farthest reaches of the stars, and yet it comes down to a long series of manageable steps. When you're first starting a round, space, as it does here in the world, is incomprehensibly vast. Instead of letting your first few explorers wander to the ends of the map, you're given a small starting area. This, the game says, is as far as you can go. When you've conquered or at least explored that sector, you're trusted with more. These steps helped me develop relationships, memories even, with each new area. I remembered which regions I saw after I developed my first prototype warp drives or when I built a deep space station so I could see what was on the other side of a black hole. It's odd, but it's sentimental."", ""Toward the end of my first game, I remember the map all the way out, astonished by how far my people had come. It was a special feeling, one I've since come to cherish, because I've realized that it's one that no other game has given me. Not even Civilization brought me this close to the progress of my empire without letting me get lost in the grandeur of it all."", ""I have to attribute that, at least in part, to the fact that Galactic Civilizations not only lets you craft your own alien species and their technology but incentivizes you to do so. No matter what race you pick or which one you create, you'll have a few basic ships to choose from. Each is there to fill a specific role, but you won't get anything particularly special there. However, if you want to take the schematics for the latest and greatest antimatter missile launcher and use them for an otherwise vulnerable cargo ship, you can do that. You can also make a mega-carrier holding dozens of assault drones that can sweep through any defense around. These creations will usually cost a little more than the usual fare, but the degree of control you have over them is worth the time and the money, especially when paired with a well-crafted strategy playing to the strengths of a custom-made race. It ties micro- and macromanagement together in a way that pushes you to win with your own creations and your own ideas."", ""That's also where Galactic Civilizations begins to break down. Much as Elder Scrolls games are expected to have a lot of bugs because they are so open, Galactic Civilizations has a lot of rough edges. I played a final build of the game, and there were still some missing textures, odd graphical glitches, poorly edited music, and one missing technology description. They were all cosmetic, but they were common enough to be distracting."", ""The bigger problems come from how unrefined some of the ancillary features are. One of the biggest additions is the ideology system. As you make choices about how the shape of your civilization progresses, you'll build up points in Benevolence, Pragmatism, or Malevolence. This is intended to be a morality system, but in practice, its effects are loose and intangible. Picking a new step on one of the three trees will usually grant you a one-time bonus, but they aren't substantial, and they don't represent play style. In my second game, I was ruthless and declared war on everyone, but I was able to maintain a facade of altruism by picking certain dialogue options. As a method of embodying the kind of civilization you want to be, the Ideology system doesn't work."", ""Taken as a whole, Galactic Civilization's failings are minor. For most games, a few major pieces that dont quite fit together would be a death knell. Galactic Civilizations keeps its focus right where it needs to--on excellent fundamentals. Progressive pacing makes the enormity of space amenable and paradoxically personal, while the sheer number and variety of tools and options at your disposal allow you to succeed and win if you can out-think everyone else.""]"Josiah Renaudin,14-May-15,Last Word Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/last-word-review/1900-6416144/,7,PC,"['In Last Words prim and proper world, words speak louder than actions, and combat is fueled by discourse, shifting the momentum of a conversation. This might sound dull in theory, but in practice, the numerous tactics and systems at play lead to an enjoyably varied, if initially confounding system. Combining tact, power, and a healthy dose of subtlety leaves your discussion partner susceptible to your every whim--providing little more than a deflated ellipsis in response to your last word. Despite its elementary presentation, Last Word stands out as a witty, novel venture carried by clever writing and a creative form of combat.', 'To buy into Last Words concept, you need to suspend your disbelief and accept the bizarre power of the spoken word within this otherwise realistic society. The courtly, cultured characters have the gift of gab, constantly spouting long-winded tales of their family names and the distinguished natures of their storied houses. Their words carry unique weight, though, as whoever speaks the last word and wins an argument leaves his or her counterpart powerless. Youll often see NPCs at a door endlessly trading polite after yous or I insists in fear of letting someone else finish the conversation.', 'This strange societal wrinkle produces plenty of silly moments, but when it comes to actually engaging in longer conversations, the Discourse mechanism is anything but simplistic. Think of it as a basic RPG battle, but instead of swinging a blade or blasting enemies with a fireball, you leverage disruptive, submissive, and aggressive forms of banter to push the conversation in your favor. You often open with a disruptive phrase in order to fill up your power meter, followed by something more submissive that spends power to gain tact. Aggressive phrases, which consume stored tact, effect the most change in the conversation bar, so you need to parlay your power into tact before the opportunity to really push the dialogue arises.', 'More and more systems are stacked atop this foundation. A characters composure changes from collected, to irritated, and eventually to uncivilized, based on a sort of rock-paper-scissors system. Certain actions serve as counters to others, and if you continue to correctly rebut your foils last assertion, their composure cracks and eventually shatters. This adds a bit more venom to your aggressive moves, lowering your opponents defense and more quickly swaying the conversation meter in your favor. Purchased skills and attributes continue to add bite to your bark, but it takes practice to sharpen your conversational steel and become a true threat.', 'Even with a tutorial that helps you navigate through the dense schemes, Last Words Discourse feature is far too opaque early on. All the different tones and meters take time and effort to both understand and intelligently utilize, so you have to bang your head against the systems and fail a few times before the flow of conversations becomes clear. After you learn the ropes, this unique take on turn-based action begins to shine, and the fair-yet-steep difficulty curve gives you ample opportunity to test your tongue.', 'Outside of the conversational duels, the regular discussions you have with the cast are brainy and nimble. Last Word never falls too in love with its aristocratic tone, staying on the right side of ""tongue-in-cheek"" through its intentional pretentiousness. Theres a deep well of text to draw from, too, since the other major mechanism at play surrounds gossiping with your peers about specific hot-button topics. Leveling up these topics by talking to the right person at the right time opens up new narrative avenues, and if you manage to examine each corner of your environment and learn everything you can from its guests, a few interesting wrinkles are added to the last few story sequences. For a game trapped in windowed mode and focused on a single location, Last Word is rich in subsidiary content.', 'On the surface, the characters appear as little more than colored silhouettes, their different hues based on each house of origin. But once you enter a conversation, hand-drawn caricatures appear, sporting expressions and audible squawks that pair well with their personalities. Each member of the small cast has a name as fanciful as their persona--from Whitty Gawship to Professor Chet Chatters. Its a peculiar world with far too much one-upmanship for anyone to want to live in, but for a four-hour visit, its a treat.', 'It isnt exactly easy to pick up, but the layered Discourse system in Last Word is worth the few verbal jabs and hooks needed in order to master it. The turn-based structure succeeds at supplying a fun alternative to the cavalcade of fantasy RPGs on the market, and while it can be easy to roll your eyes at all the patterned bow ties and discussions of fine wines, the posh tenor never tips so far that it becomes pretentious. Last Word shows that you dont need a towering sword or a 15-minute summoning sequence to create an exciting battle system--sometimes it just takes a sharp script and an even sharper tongue.']"Cameron Woolsey,14-May-15,Action Henk Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/action-henk-review/1900-6416134/,7,PC,"[""Editor's note: Due to a discrepancy between the version of the game used for review and the full release, the original Action Henk review contained some inaccuracies. It has been updated to reflect the game as released. - KV, 5/14/2015"", 'I like to think of Action Henk as a retired action hero on the fast road to retaking the spotlight. A distended beer belly hanging far over his belt, Henk is a small action figure sporting a wide, yet determined grin separating an impressive set of 1980s sideburns. Its hard not to root for him as he slides down ramps and over obstacles at a relentless velocity. This side-scrolling, speed-running platformer has the rush of a classic Sonic the Hedgehog game, without any of the irritating sidekicks.', 'Henk sets off on his pint-sized adventure sprinting along plastic orange ramps--like the ones for toy cars--and wooden blocks, leaping and butt-sliding toward the goal line--oh yes, butt-sliding. Holding down a button causes Henk to fly (literally) on the seat of his pants. Sliding down inclines builds up speed, and a comet-like trail of flame jets off Henks plastic-molded posterior. You burn through loops and bounce off walls while rushing past checkpoints as you complete the first group of levels, which exist entirely on the floor of a childs bedroom, complete with jumbled clothing drawers, posters, and scattered video game cartridges. But you dont stay stuck in the bedroom for long. Soon, Henk finds himself making tracks on a beach resort, and later swinging through a lush green jungle. Despite his appearance, Henk moves through each level at an energetic pace, all to the tune of a jumping soundtrack.', ' ', 'Action Henk is a fast ride and pure speed-running bliss from start to goal. It feels like Sonic in his glory days. Though the kindly faced Henk doesnt quite parallel the blue blurs devil-may-care attitude, he nearly matches the blistering speed with his stride. Many levels last less than a minute, but as you make your way around the track, you notice other pathways and ramps just out of reach. They all lead you to the same point, and yet the promise of more even speed makes the desire to reach them all the more enticing. There are tricks that only experience can teach--for example, hopping just before a declining ramp increases the speed of your butt-slide, rewarding you with more air time than ever before. Soon those other areas become attainable, opening up steeper slides and more death-defying jumps--all of which amounts to gaining even more of that gratifying speed and fewer moments of slowdown.', 'Completing levels nets you medals of bronze, silver, or gold, which are collected to unlock new areas. The setup is similar to that of some mobile games that require a certain number of stars or other related items to unlock gates. But the rules here are not nearly as strict. New sections open up quickly, and unlocking the final section is possible only several of hours after starting. It does make sense: this is a game whose conceit is unrelenting speed, not throwing out road blocks. Because of this playability, I felt myself running through older courses again because I actually wanted to, just for the fun, and not out of any sort of obligation. It cuts down on a lot of the undue stress usually presented by games that make it difficult to unlock new missions. If youre having trouble with any of the levels, you can race against a bronze, silver, or gold ghost, who will show you the way.', 'Though the kindly faced Henk doesnt quite parallel the blue blurs devil-may-care attitude, he nearly matches the blistering speed with his stride.', ""There is still some stress involved. At the end of most sections, you face a tough boss challenge. These races can require a lot of patience and restarts as they test your speed-running skills. The final section missions, however, are the most difficult, and are capped off with a boss challenge that had me wearing down my restart key. Earning a gold medal in every level of a section unlocks a touch bonus mission to collect coins. The medal also unlocks the rainbow medal ghost, as well as the ghost for the top player of the level--both of which are the hardest challenges you can face. The game doesn't suffer much from technical issues; there is minor lag in some levels, but it doesn't stay noticeable for long."", 'Though reaching the final series of levels is possible in only a few hours, there is still a lot of extra content to experience and discover. Completing challenges such as boss battles unlocks new characters and skins--the Sonic costume for Henk with his belly bursting through the front is an easy favorite. Action Henk is a community-focused game, and includes tools to build and share your own custom level and download other users levels from its Steam page. I tried a few of the higher rated tracks, many of which are great. Some send you through enough loops to make your head spin, while others are designed for pure speed. There is also an online racing mode, where you and a group of fellow speed-runners compete for the best time in a level. You are given a time limit and as many restarts as possible to secure the best time and a chance to bop the top runner off the first-place podium. There is one problem with multiplayer, however. Having a text chat box is great, as it gives you the opportunity to talk smack or get running advice form the pros. But because of its size and position on the dark background, it covers too much of the screen. ', ' ', 'Completing Action Henk will set you back around five hours or so, and you will be at the edge of your seat for most of that time. The speed is immensely satisfying, and earning those precious gold medals after replaying levels feels good. Its a heart-pumping adventure starring action figures and toy tracks, so give yourself a break and come play.']"Justin Clark,14-May-15,"Invisible, Inc. Review - GameSpot",http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/invisible-inc-review/1900-6416143/,7,PC,"[""When I was growing up, I always found myself surrounded by kids who wanted to be James Bond. Being at that age where you start to recognize things as being cool right around the time The Living Daylights and License To Kill happened probably had a little to do with that, but, really, shooting bad guys, playing high stakes card games, quaffing martinis, beautiful women going in and out of the bedroom's revolving doors--all of this has a universal, immortal appeal."", 'While I\'m not made of stone, and certainly know suave and seductive when I see it, I never wanted to be Bond. I wanted to be M. I wanted to be the guy who had been doing the dirt, and doing it well for so long that he got to order dudes like Bond around, moving conspirators, double agents, and sensitive information around the globe as if he were engaged in a game of chess. I always imagined being the guy to scream into a microphone, ""You\'ve got the files, now get the hell out of there.""', ""For that reason alone, Invisible, Inc. now owns a tiny piece of my heart. It's a tactical, turn-based stealth espionage game where I am the eyes of God, looking down on the isometric, randomly generated playing field. There's infinite time to plot out my spies' every move and observe the guards' reactions before completing the mission, ordering the spies to make a beeline for an extraction point, and beaming them out. The game recalls XCOM in in the way a fallen spy succumbs to permanent death, and in its randomly generated levels; few stealth games are this slick, and even fewer are unwilling to sacrifice any opportunity for tension or raised stakes to make its hero look cooler. Here, the silent, invisible completion of the mission is all that matters, and the stakes are too high to waste time grandstanding."", ""The situation: It's the distant future, and after years of digging up serious dirt on the megacorporations of the new world, the titular spy agency is raided, forcing the chief, her two best agents, and Incognita--their all-encompassing JARVIS.-style AI--to go on the run. You start off with just the two agents, with a maximum of four active at a time (10 total are coming as downloadable content down the road), and your overall mission is to gather enough expendable resources to strike back at your enemies within 72 hours. This is the point where the portable version of Incognita loses power."", ""Sadly, the telling of the story is reduced to well-written but sparse lip service after the fully-animated intro, but it's less of a problem once you realize how carefully considered your actions in every subsequent mission have to be. From your jet, you have to infiltrate various corporations around the globe. Sometimes it's to get new confidential info out of a corporate facility; sometimes you have to hack into an executive's mind and fend off his private security while waiting to download the goods; sometimes it's just to get your hands on some brand new spy toys. The thing is, virtually everything is a resource. Aside from the expected mechanics of a tactical role-playing game--moving around and carrying objects are governed by quantifiable stats (movement points and inventory space) you must wisely invest in--you also have a security level that rises steadily with every turn, and each trip around the wheel, an obstacle appears to make your life a little harder, be it new armored guards, or a security protocol that makes hacking a greater danger."", ""Until much later in the game, ambushing and knocking out a guard typically involves using electrical, non-lethal means which, because you're not operating out of an agency, have limited uses. Guns make things easier, but while guards and robot drones are always packing heat, ammo is a seriously rare commodity. There's a shot you can buy to Pulp Fiction a fallen agent back from the dead, and a very limited option to rewind a bad move (an option that becomes negligible at higher difficulties); otherwise, a dead agent is a dead agent. Occasionally, agents survive, and the enemy takes them hostage. You can potentially set out on rescue missions, which appear later in the game, but that involves hours you don't necessarily have, because jetsetting around the planet costs more time than you think, depending on the distance to your mission. If Incognita goes bye-bye, or if all your agents are dead, guess what? Game over. You're starting from the beginning."", 'The upshot is that this isn\'t so tricky a proposition, since a player comfortable with the relatively simple setup can blow through the game, good ending or bad, in about four to five hours. But this isn\'t a game like many role-playing games of its ilk where there are pawns to sacrifice for the sake of letting someone charge some special maneuver, or to absorb a bullet while other soldiers move around. If you move a spy around, you have to consider every possible outcome of both your move and the reactions of the guards around the facility, because being wrong will cost time and life. Taking your time and playing smarter, not harder, grants missions a pleasant clockwork precision, with every agent in the field working in tandem towards a common goal--and that goal is ""attack"" far less often than in a typical spy game.', 'The flaws are all in the execution. The facilities your agents infiltrate are busy enough, with movement grids, wireframe scans that Incognita can hack, and vision cones from all the cameras and guards in the vicinity. Add in the random industrial trash scattered around, and the never-quite-right camera angles, and there are times when the screen is just total chaos. Enemy AI is rather typical for a stealth game, where the same guard can range from implausibly obtuse (why didn\'t that guard open fire the second he saw me duck into a hiding spot instead of announcing to nobody, ""I\'m gonna investigate""?) to trigger-happy sharpshooters who can shoot the hair off your eyebrows from two rooms away in a matter of minutes. Like many stealth games, Invisible Inc.\'s systems--several types of vision cones, night-vision goggles, and so forth--provide explanations for highly game-ish behaviors, but those behaviors don\'t necessarily adhere to the logic of human nature.', ' ', ""The biggest problem is the simple fact that while the ticking clocks in and out of the actual espionage provide a nice anxious framework for the game, the story in between is a letdown. Missions are often interchangeable, with the same briefing used for multiple stages with the same objective across the board; the between-stage dialogue, while sharp, doesn't exactly tell the same escalating story as the gameplay."", 'Luckily, the gameplay sings, making for a game that\'s not as powerful as it could be, but undeniably accessible. The random levels contribute to the joy, meaning no experience is ever truly repeated, and each stage\'s relative brevity and array of objective types makes it rather light and breezy while still maintaining a measure of depth. It\'s not quite the patient MI6 power fantasy I had in mind as a kid, but it\'s close. It\'s a fine, unique, strategic experience that has occasional frustrating glimmers of the possibly of being something more. Then again, every great spy story is contingent on people not letting people know or care about ""something more,"" isn\'t it?']"Britton Peele,14-May-15,Not a Hero Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/not-a-hero-review/1900-6416139/,7,PS4,"['It\'s election season. How will you campaign for mayor? Will you promise better schools? Guarantee that you\'ll fix all those potholes? Perhaps you\'ll run on the more straightforward assurance that you will ""shoot criminals in the face""? That last one might not be the most humane of political platforms, but it makes for an entertaining 2D action game.', 'In Not a Hero, you are a hired gun for a politician named Bunnylord, an anthropomorphic purple rabbit who has come from the future to, presumably, save the world. He is convinced that to prevent the disastrous future he has seen, he needs to be elected as mayor by the end of the month.', ""In theory, this would make you, his employee, a hero. But true to the title of the game, you do a lot of things that aren't very heroic. Sure, you might take down a drug lord and save some hostages, but along the way, you murder a lot of people. Bunnylord himself isn't a big believer of things like court trials. He has open disdain for religious people, hates children, and throws around a word that disrespects the mentally handicapped. It's odd to think that he's supposedly on a mission to save the world, considering that he doesn't seem like a very nice man (or rabbit ... whatever)."", ""The violence in Not a Hero might be disturbing if it weren't for the absurdity wrapped around it."", ' ', 'To help Bunnylord get elected, you mostly shoot people and blow things up. Even mundane tasks like putting up campaign posters or collecting wind chimes (which is very important for, well, reasons) involve leaving a trail of bodies, most of which die in a comically over-the-top fashion.', 'For the most part, you can run left and right, slide and shoot. Not a Hero\'s shooting is ""cover based,"" but you don\'t actually need to be behind any cover--just kind of near it. Hitting the cover button often makes you just sort of hug the wall, shrouding you in shadow for protection and, if you haven\'t been spotted by nearby enemies, keeping you out of sight. Hitting the fire button while in cover pops you out long enough to take a shot, and you\'re relatively safe unless an enemy gets close enough to punch you.', 'The moment-to-moment action, including running, shooting, sliding into cover, and shooting some more is great ... most of the time. Occasional hiccups occur when the game forces you to aim right when you\'re trying to aim left. Or you might try to take cover where you are, but, because the ""cover"" button is the same as the ""slide"" button, you suddenly find yourself sliding right towards the barrel of a criminals shotgun. When you start the game, the temptation is to run in guns blazing, Contra style. But until you get a good grasp of Not a Hero\'s quirks, it can be better to take it slow.', ' ', ""Your health regenerates, but you can go down quickly in a hailstorm of bullets. Sometimes the better course of action is to be methodical, watching and listening for cues telling you that an enemy's clip is empty before you pop out of cover. It's also smart to use the game's executions--brutal kills you can perform on a stunned enemy after sliding into them."", ""Beyond those basics, each of the game's nine characters have different traits that affect how you control them. For example, when playing as most of the characters, you have to be very careful when you choose to reload because you can't move or cancel out of the reload animation once it starts. One character can move while reloading, however, while another can shoot to cancel the reload. One character is very fast but has very little ammo, while another has lots of ammo but moves slowly. My personal favorite character, Clive, can run fast while shooting two guns straight in front, like he jumped straight out of a John Woo movie."", 'The violence in Not a Hero might be disturbing if it weren\'t for the absurdity wrapped around it. Bunnylord might order you to shoot someone in the face, but he also brags about how he\'s reduced the city\'s amount of ""illegal dry-humping."" One problem with the game\'s humor, though, is that it tends to try too hard. Every mission begins with a lengthy briefing and ends with a debriefing, each of which are primarily vehicles in which the writers cram as many attempts as humor as possible. Every line reads as an attempt to elicit a laugh, but most are only good enough for a chuckle at best--especially since you never get a break from the insanity. Before long, I wanted to skip all the dialogue (which, thankfully, is an option) rather than sit through a lot of dumb jokes.', 'Every line reads as an attempt to elicit a laugh, but most are only good enough for a chuckle at best.', ' ', ""It's to the gameplays credit that I usually wanted to get through the story beats quickly and jump into the next mission. Each of the game's 21 levels (24 if you count a few secret ones) are short and relatively straightforward--kill enemies, maybe collect a few things, find the exit--but each stage's layout is well-designed, often offering a few different paths to the goal (maybe, for example, you crash through a window instead of entering a room from the door on the opposite side). A few different enemy types also help mix things up because several of the bad guys you come across are immune to certain attacks, like slide tackles. Occasionally, the longer levels in the game can be frustrating thanks to enemies that have a tendency to kill you in one hit (forcing you to go back to the beginning), but their size and complexity is still welcome."", 'The plain ""kill all enemies"" mission structure is also broken up with extra challenges to complete in each level, such as ... well, ""kill all enemies."" Other than that, you might be asked to find a hidden item, defeat a certain number of enemies without getting hit, or complete a level without using a certain number of bullets. You can reach the game\'s credits without completing any of these objectives, but they usually add challenge and variety to what might otherwise be a bland mission.', ""If you don't try to complete all these challenges, you can easily blast your way through Not a Hero in a handful of hours, unlocking most or all of the characters along the way. You can extend your time in the game by completing levels with all the different characters, but the game doesn't do a good job of incentivizing you to do so. Still, there's a lot of fun to be had in this explosive quest for political domination.

Thats on tap with Magicka: Wizard Wars, a free-to-play multiplayer take on the action-first franchise that features those iconic wizards who have always reminded me of Star Wars' Jawas--only fancier. Despite this frenzied focus, much of the appeal of the core series has been maintained, due to the continued emphasis on slick player skill over gimmicks, and a genial, if bloody, sense of humor. There are a few rough edges here, however, thanks to some design miscues, a slightly buggy client, and a level grind that kicks in long before you get bored with incinerating enemy Gandalfs. Yet even with these issues, the games pace and light-hearted take on everything (how could I stay mad at a game that uses a corny Arnold Schwarzenegger impersonator to call the action?) keep you coming back for more, even while the flaws try to nudge you away."", 'Basic gameplay breaks standard Magicka down to online battle arenas where mages duel to the death. The general feel is similar to the earlier games in the franchise, albeit without any single-player campaign or any sort of cooperative multiplayer. Here, you create one of the franchises trademark spunky magic users at the start of play and then head into one-off battle arenas. Over time, your spell-slinger develops by gaining experience points, leveling up, and acquiring gear and special magical attacks that let you become a more efficient mystical killing machine. Two forms of currency are used in the game. Mastery tokens earned with every level up allow you to purchase special gear, spells, outfits, and the like, while crowns awarded at the end of every match can be used in the in-game store to buy similar weapons, magic rings, and so forth. Real money can be used to buy gear directly and load up on both tokens and crowns, in case you want to cut some corners.', ' ', 'The game deals with primary magical talents that are performed by pressing the Q-W-E-R and A-S-D-F keys. Each one represents a particular arcane skill--fire, healing, death magic, lightning, and beyond--all of which can be called up via a quick key-press or three and then put into play through a click of the mouse. Those special magicks are one-off spells that are slotted in the 1-4 keys for occasional use. They are best when you need to go nuclear on enemies by using the likes of a meteor shower that covers the battlefield, a thunderstorm that calls up devastating lightning, or something a little more subtle, like haste (to run away) or midsummers blessing (to heal everyone simultaneously).', 'None of this is easy. While you can lean on simple presses, and you can of course deploy the big-gun magicks as needed, key combos are required for the best spells and the best blocks. So, hello there, steep learning curve and a whole lot of experimentation (although the game thankfully gives you tips for fending off specific attacks every time youre killed). It took a long time for me to even start to become comfortable with the controls, and I was still routinely schooled by opponents the entire time I played.', 'I was never smacked around so hard that I became overly frustrated, though. Whether I was toasted by flames, blown up by a meteor strike, or even perforated by an enemy imp familiar when I wasnt paying enough attention, I was able to laugh it off and dive right back in for more. Speed is the primary element staving off annoyance. Its tough to stay mad for long when youre respawning in seconds. The tactical layer of the game is another successful factor, too. A huge importance is placed on spell defenses, so I looked at the game as something of a strategic puzzle, and constantly went into new matches to test new possibilities.', 'The color palette is almost unrelentingly bright, with mages apparently costumed by Crayola, and spells going off like huge displays of the very best in modern fireworks technology.', 'But while the core structure of Magicka: Wizard Wars works well due to its reliance on strong core mechanics, there isnt a lot of depth here. There are just three modes of play, and the only one worth playing is Wizard Warfare. This is a pick-up-and-play mode, with simple rules that see two teams of four duking it out over stone circles that serve as control and spawn points. It moves quickly, due to small maps and teleportation rings that let the teams get into each others hood-hidden faces. I found that the zippy speed kept things likeably nuts and even helped emphasize teamwork, as the team must stick close together, help heal one another, and assault control points as a unit in order to survive.', 'Soul Harvest is the other headline mode of play, but it plays much slower and as a result isnt nearly as exciting. It features a more involved structure that has you slaughter monsters for souls in kind of a battle of attrition, with the final goal of demolishing the enemy home-base effigy. None of this jibes with the games strengths as a battle royal at warp speed. Teams patrol the map, kill wimpy respawning monsters over and over, and attempt to avoid one another. Duel is even flimsier, albeit for the opposite reasons. It is fast, with cramped battlefields that allow no leeway. There doesnt seem to be room here for much more than toe-to-toe magical slugfests.', 'All three modes of play are made more entertaining by colorful visuals and bombastic sound. This isnt a game to take seriously, even with wizards regularly exploding into bloody chunks. The color palette is almost unrelentingly bright, with mages apparently costumed by Crayola, and spells going off like huge displays of the very best in modern fireworks technology. Sound is also compellingly boomy and whooshy, and the aforementioned Schwarzenegger soundalike is hilariously understated. I never got tired of hearing him tell my team that a spawn point had been stolen by the enemy and that I needed to steal it baaack!', ' ', 'The free-to-play structure causes problems, however. Both the mastery tokens and crowns are slow to accumulate and the prices for items are through the roof. The 25 tokens you might earn per level dont go very far when the average mastery upgrade costs 50 or more. Making matters even worse, all mastery gear is nested in locked trees that force you to buy three or four items you dont want, just to get one that you do. The same goes for the store: the average match brings in only a few hundred crowns, while even the lamest gear has a price tag of at least 5,000 or 10,000. After the first five or six levels, the game feels like a grind.', 'The temptation, of course, is to spend real money on upgrades such as the heavily promoted experience boosters and wizard starting packs (which seem reasonably priced, as far as these things go). But with that said, you cant buy your way to success. Although picking up some extra goodies with cash can put you over the top, the game is all about player skill and speed. No matter how cool a robe you have, no matter how powerful your magic items and special spells, you can still be killed by a rival player with basic gear and faster fingers. So there really is a balance here, even with the grind providing ongoing temptation to whip out your credit card.', 'More options need to be provided. I really wanted the ability to trick out Wizard Warfare matches. Just being able to play best two out of three would have helped keep the momentum flowing, as the one-off games that generally last just four or five minutes are the only ones currently available. I spent way too much time on the matchmaking screen, waiting for the same four or five minutes on average (much longer later at night) to get a game. Im not sure if these waits mean that there arent very many players online or if this is some shortcoming of the software. Regardless, I spent about as much time waiting for matches to be made than I did actually battling mages.', 'Another shortcoming is the inability to boot players. Although I didnt have a ton of trouble with griefers, I did encounter at least a few idiots who just ran around maps killing anyone and everyone indiscriminately and still clocking high scores. There needs to be a way to kick these people out, or at least to stop rewarding them for killing allies.', 'On occasion, bugs interfere with setting up matches. I encountered frame-rate glitches, stutters in the main menus, and the odd crash to the desktop. I also encountered a Code Marlin error that made it impossible to start a game. Whenever this would occur, the game would refuse to register that there was a full complement of eight players logged in, even though everyone was apparently ready to go on the starting screen. Since this error seemed to take place in bunches, this got frustrating real fast, as it would block matches from starting for 10-minute stretches.', ""As entertaining as Magicka: Wizard Wars can be, the game has yet to achieve greatness. The quick-paced and skill-driven combat system casts a charm on you in the beginning, but the delights wear off over time due to the presence of only a single good mode of play, grinding, and a few irritating bugs.

In Tasharen Entertainment's maritime action/exploration game, these factions represent the four styles of play Windward nominally offers: exploration, combat, trading, and diplomacy (read: questing). In the game's yawn-inducing first hour, that may seem like an apt description for the potential in the procedurally generated world set in front of you. But as you sink more time into Windward, its similarities to Sid Meier's Pirates! reveal themselves to be a masquerade--yet it still finds more time for the yawns, for good measure."", 'Windward presents itself as a ""chart your own adventure"" high-seas simulator promising great ocean expanses, complex economic trading, diplomatic engagement, and high-octane sea battles for whoever wishes to find their inner Magellan or Admiral Horatio Nelson. You sail your ship (and the small fleet you gather at the beginning of the game) around procedurally generated seas trading goods, hunting pirates, laying siege to cities, and building diplomatic relationships with towns and opposing alliances. But every mode features the depth of a freshman-level philosophy course, and if you want to engage in any of the non-combat options the game offers, you must deal with rote, padding-fueled combat for extended stretches.', ""For a game that features an entire faction dedicated to trading, Windward's economy system is both comically simple and overly drawn out. The best way (honestly, it's the only reliable way) to gain money in Windward is through trading. You enter a town (through a bland menu) and either buy goods the residents have too much of or sell them goods they are short on. That's it. It never becomes more complicated than that. The aggravating, time-consuming portion of the system is that for the first few hours of the game, youre stuck with ships with a two-slot cargo hold, which means you can only sell two trade goods at a time. So you're forced to waste time sailing around these large-ish maps unloading your cargo rather than taking care of a significant amount of business at once."", ""To further that aggravation, the questing/diplomacy systems--which feed into experience you get to make your ship better (read: survivable)--also take up space in your cargo hold. So, if you're ferrying passengers for a quest, you can only carry one trade good. That creates an interesting incentive to make sure you're maximizing your time, but it mostly creates an incentive to never quest (and therefore rarely engage in direct relationship-building services) because it never pays half as well as the more rote side of trading."", ""For a game that features an entire faction dedicated to trading, Windward's economy system is both comically simple and overly drawn out."", ""But, wait! Exploration! I love exploration! I will spend hours just walking around The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and not fighting anyone (if I can help it), or questing, or doing anything because I just want to take in the gorgeously realized environments. I will happily get lost in a part of Brooklyn I have never visited before because I will be overcome by the stunning Victorian houses, the trees that seem to be more than just streetside window dressing, and the innumerable churches that are genuine architectural wonders. Exploration in Windward never achieves a fraction of that pleasure, because exploration is fun and intoxicating only when you're presented with a space worth exploring. Gone Home is literally a walk through your house, but every nook and cranny of the Greenbriar abode offers a glimpse into the lives of that family. Eidolon drops you into a massive forest and invites you to get lost and engage in exceptionally subtle environmental storytelling. Windward gives you bland chains of islets and an ocean, and you're never without a handy course direction effect telling you where to go. An entire faction of the game has no reason to exist because it represents a meaningless portion of the Windward experience."", 'Combat exists to break up the monotony of the other three core mechanical loops in the game, but it gets stuck in its own rote monotony. It takes a couple of hours for your ship to get any combat capabilities beyond circling around your enemy, auto-firing, and waiting for the cooldown on your volley shot to refresh. That\'s dull but fair for the singular ships you encounter at the beginning of the game, but once you encounter more ships in the game\'s second area--Windward\'s admittedly massive world maps are broken down into significantly smaller chunks--success in ship combat becomes an arbitrary question of ""will the game send more ships at me than I can possibly handle"" until you get more upgrades. Conquering towns involves dropping anchor in a circle outside a port for a nominal period of time.', ' ', ""That feeds into Windward's most perfidious sin. Even if you decide you're really into Windward's exploration, trading, or questing, you can't properly engage in them without sinking a lot of time into combat once you reach the second area. Trading is totally blocked off until you've kicked all the pirates out of any given region. And pirates spawn rapidly in Windward, and theyll take over towns if you lose your vigilance for even a second. Windward doesnt give you the necessary tools to properly defend regions you've secured from pirates, leading to a constant hit and run. Even if you dont engage in the game's combat, it still becomes the only element of the game you can interact with."", ""The opening portions of Winward have you falling asleep at your computer; later areas have you cursing angrily as every small victory you win is erased by the overzealous enemy AI (aided by utterly complacent allies content to watch town after town fall to pirates). The promise of exploring Windward's world as you see fit is a false one, and Windward never earns its sea legs.""]"Jason Venter,13-May-15,Color Guardians Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/color-guardians-review/1900-6416136/,3,PS4,"[""Color Guardians is a beautiful headache. The idea is simple enough: you're a colorful mascot, running mostly from left to right and dodging back and forth along three lanes to avoid upcoming hazards while you collect glowing orbs to boost your score. The experience could have been delightful, but instead wavers between monotonous and infuriating."", ""As the game begins, most of the color is sucked out of a magical world and replaced with darkness. You, a red guardian, and your two friends--blue and yellow--are the only ones who possess the ability to restore the vibrant hues that otherwise will be gone forever. The setup is reminiscent of Kirby and the Rainbow Curse or de Blob, only this game is populated by generic characters you've never seen before and probably won't care much about now."", ""If making everything right only required you to gather the orbs strewn about the three lanes, Color Guardians wouldn't offer much to challenge you, even with the addition of the environmental hazards. However, as a guardian you possess the ability to change between the three primary tones, and must utilize that gift in order to make real headway. If you pass over orbs while appropriately colored, you gain rewards. You do better still if you press one of three buttons as you find yourself in position. This is a neat idea on paper but tedious in practice. Imagine if your score in an old Sonic or Mario game were dependent on your willingness to press a button each time you passed over a ring or coin."", ""Earning the best possible ranking in a stage is difficult, since you must manage a nearly perfect run to do it. A two-star rank is essentially the default. If you mess up badly enough that you're in line for a lesser accolade, you seldom survive the effort, at least during the first half of the game. After that, it sometimes seems the only way you ever reach a goal is by the skin of your teeth. Fortunately, you can resume as often as you like from a checkpoint, once you pass one. The downside is that these are in rather short supply as the game wears on, and thus you have to retread a lot of hostile ground."", ""Early on, the challenge isn't severe, but that changes with the introduction of new mechanics. You eventually find oversized parasols that you collect automatically as you pass over them, and these carry you into the air for a while, after which you can either descend slowly or discard them to initiate a quick dive. Elsewhere, your path is blocked by color-coded barriers that recede only when you approach them with the proper hue applied. There are mushrooms and giant fans that allow you to quickly gain elevation, but your color must match theirs, or they're useless."", ""None of that may sound especially taxing, but it comes together in some truly exasperating ways. The developer did a commendable job of taking full advantage of each new gameplay wrinkle. Less admirably, it produced a lot of seemingly simple scenarios where you must do the opposite of what feels natural or face the consequences. Because of the particular button layout, it's easy to associate each color with a particular lane, but any color can require your interaction at any time, often in a rapid-fire sequence and with all manner of distractions. This dynamic is of course exploited frequently. Likewise, the game eventually trains you to switch hues so that you can gather trinkets and spring triumphantly from color-coded mushrooms. You then tackle a level that forces you to do precisely the opposite, lest you launch into inky spirits flying overhead. In the third world and elsewhere thereafter, you ride in mine carts that only switch lanes if you press a button corresponding to the desired lane. Such areas force your brain to adjust yet again, especially when segments of track are interrupted by ledges for a brief time. The net effect of the game's design is that you spend your time racing through one level after another, failing frequently until you memorize every danger that lies between one checkpoint and the next. Each stumble is punishment for your lack of a crystal ball that might allow you to divine what obstacle comes next. Successes don't feel like proof of skill; they merely attest to your ability to memorize another sequence."", ""The irksome platforming is exacerbated by a number of related issues. You frequently find yourself floating over wide gaps, forced to land briefly on small islands and launch from pads. Sometimes, you must drop your parasol and quickly switch colors and spring into the air again before changing to another lane. Then, as you tumble into an abyss, you realize that you actually needed to switch two lanes at once, which wasn't immediately apparent. An on-screen indicator lets you know where you will land, but it's mostly only useful to explain your mysterious death so that you can do things differently the next time around. Another problem is that sometimes the game hangs for a split-second without warning, which murders your timing, or indicators pop up as you pass score thresholds and ruin your concentration."", ""Whatever its other issues are, Color Guardians at least nails its presentation. Its visual design in particular is quite appealing. Regions start out draped in shadow, but everything comes to vibrant life as paint washes over it. There's lots of activity most of the time, as well, from floating spirits to mischievous goblins and dancing light and shadows. The music and sound effects set the stage nicely, being both mystical and energetic in just the right proportion."", ' ', ""If you find yourself enjoying the game despite its excessively punishing design, or perhaps even because of it, there's good news: the five worlds possess around ten stages apiece, along with boss encounters (though each of these offers increasingly challenging variations on a theme, rather than wholly distinct confrontations). When you defeat the recurring baddie at the end of an area, you can backtrack and search for hidden sprites and unlock additional stages, or just revisit your familiar stomping grounds in search of better scores. Leaderboards let you know how you rank compared to other players, which should be a nice incentive once the game has been in the wild long enough."", ""Color Guardians features a concept that's still new enough to feel fresh, and makes the most of it. All too often, though, the stages are designed in such a way that you're tricked into failing, and any technical issues stand out more than they might elsewhere because precise timing and concentration are so vital to success. You can always rebound after failure, but sometimes it's difficult to muster the energy to do so when part of you knows there's bound to be another trick of some sort waiting just a few screens away. It's all very pretty, sure. It's just not worth it.""]"Miguel Concepcion,13-May-15,Attack on Titan: Humanity in Chains Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/attack-on-titan-humanity-in-chains-review/1900-6416141/,4,3DS,"[""We love playing David to countless video game Goliaths. Bosses are, more often than not, larger than the game heroes who defeat them. In Attack on Titan: Humanity in Chains, you're never short of giants to vanquish as you reenact scenes from the anime and manga from which the game was adapted. If there are thrills to be found, they come from swinging through a map using the maneuver gear. Using this mobility against the titans can provide a rush as you amass your first dozen kills, but don't expect this excitement to last. Humanity in Chains is a surprisingly soulless affair, a reminder that sometimes it takes a game packed with titans to make us appreciate refined adventures with fewer behemoths."", ""Much of the best anime is set in worlds you wish you could visit, such as the early 1980s interpretation of metropolitan Japan in Urusei Yatsura, or the sprawling vision of Earth in Dragon Ball. As good as the original material is, its setting is an utterly miserable world. One hundred years of peace have just been shattered by the return of remorseless giants who only want to eat humans. What are you to do but try to defend yourself, especially if you're a revenge-hungry teen who watched helplessly as your mom became a snack? The titans' perpetually maniacal faces only add insult to one's presumable fate to become a decapitated morsel. For once, we have an anime in which teenage whining, scolding, and anxiety-driven introspection is justified, even if all this motivational talk, pointless or otherwise, comprises one-third of the anime's content."", ""Humanity in Chains spares you these moments of angst while framing story missions with many of the show's most memorable scenes. If this game is partly designed to attract Attack on Titan virgins to watch the show, these brief videos are its most effective selling tools. The game is punctuated by the two opening themes and credits. If anything convinces you that you're about to experience the playable version of a well-received anime, it is the rehashing of a catchy and memorable title sequence. I haven't watched Attack on Titan since it appeared on Netflix over a year ago, so reacquainting myself with the resoundingly Germanic choral chanting was exciting, if only for a few minutes. The only thing missing is a Netflix streaming voucher to watch the show on the 3DS."", ""Attack on Titan inadvertently poses a question that could have been asked decades ago: What if Spider-Man had a penchant for bladed melee weapons and his arms were freed from web-slinging? Add the mutant-hunting sentinels and you essentially have the gameplay premise for Humanity in Chains. Much like Spider-Man, you don't question how your gear manages to find an attachment point every time; you just run with it because there are more pressing matters, like a city filled with invading titans. You spend most of your time swinging from point to point because moving on foot is impractical and, more importantly, is the easiest way to get yourself killed."", ""The point of all this maneuverability is to position yourself to attack the titans' napes, their main weak spot. Thanks to a lock-on function, this is a peculiarly simple task, provided you make an effort to avoid approaching titans from the front. Once you've initiated the attack, the only challenge lies in lining up a timing ring within a larger ring; pulling that off results in a hit. This challenge, unfortunately, makes up the bulk of your goals in Humanity in Chains, so it's normal to feel bored after about an hour of play. Aside from an optional spin attack and the ability to hinder a titan's mobility, there's no depth or nuance to combat. You're either aiming to deal a lethal blow to the titan or you're making a brief retreat in order to regroup. We've come to expect third-person adventures chocked full of objectives in a given sortie, which can take anywhere from 15 to 90 minutes to complete. There are missions in Humanity in Chains that take 30 seconds to clear. And when you're not killing titans, your tasks are more menial jobs, like performing CPR on fallen comrades or collecting food. The art department didn't even design the food; you just have to find gleaming blue dots on the ground."", ""Not wanting to stick solely to the anime's script, developer Spike Chunsoft added world mode, a feature that lets you grow and customize your own squad of titan killers and team up in multiplayer. It's a well-intentioned mode that is meant to add replay value and an RPG-inspired sense of character ownership by starting you off with baseline stats. The world mode menu screen overlooks a base with multiple facilities, giving you the impression that there are a lot of activities there with which to eat up an afternoon. It is true that you can upgrade squadmates' abilities and craft weapons in world mode, but incentives to apply these enhancements in the field are sorely lacking. Not only are you stuck with the same types of titan takedown missions found in story mode, but now you're greatly underpowered. The chances of getting grabbed by a titan are much greater, as is the unlikelihood of freeing yourself from its grasp. Learning the ropes and learning from defeat would be engaging if not for that fact that world mode doesn't unlock until you've beaten seven story missions. By then, you've been spoiled by controlling top-tier titan-killer talent, ruining any motivation to start over again as an entry-level grunt. It's a case of foreplay deferred after a game has already spoiled its best moves."", ""Attack on Titan: Humanity in Chains is further proof that the seemingly obvious genre for an anime-to-game adaptation isn't always the best one. Take the Ghost In The Shell games as another example. As enjoyable as it was to play as Motoko Kusanagi in third-person adventure Stand Alone Complex, it was an even better experience playing as the Tachikoma spider-tank in the original PlayStation game. The disappointment of poor mission variety in Humanity in Chains is compounded by the brevity of each assignment. And while world mode had the potential to show the franchise's appeal beyond the main story, its team customization allure is severely hobbled by the same shallow combat in story mode."", ""Between the can't-look-away morbidity of being eaten and watching the ensemble cast persevere, there's no denying the draw of Attack on Titan and the potential for a superb game adaptation. Humanity in Chains just isn't that game. Given the squads of soldiers, the seemingly limitless influx of titans, and one's mobility options, there is surely hope for an excellent game set in this universe in the far-flung future.""]"Nick Capozzoli,13-May-15,StarDrive 2 Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/stardrive-2-review/1900-6416138/,6,PC,"['A good 4X strategy game is a bit like a slow-burning fire--something to be stoked every now and again with a click of the mouse and watched through half-lidded eyes into the late hours. When that contented sort of complacency sets in, I\'m more easily coaxed into ""just one more turn."" These empire-building games make it easier still because they tend to defer the consequences of poor moves. Mistakes amount to small hang-ups in the otherwise effortless forward momentum of upgrades and technological developments, lost in the spaces between ascending data points on one of the genre\'s ubiquitous end-of-game line graphs. It\'s only when I come out of my daze a few scaled eras later that I often find myself long surpassed by opposing empires, the graphs telling a story of steady mediocrity since, oh, sometime in the Middle Ages when production took a brief turn towards the slightly sub-optimal.', 'The thing is, 4X games don\'t have much patience for an also-ran. They\'re ""games"" in the same way that the game of thrones is a game: you win or you die, and the middle ground is really just another burial tract. And if the same goes for the crowded, largely homogenous genre they belong to, where does that leave an entry like StarDrive 2? For the most part, the game seems to be a proper execution of its developer\'s vision; it\'s worked its way up its chosen tech trees, so to speak, arriving as a sci-fi empire builder in the grand tradition. And yet, when it\'s time to take stock, StarDrive 2 finds itself firmly in the middle.', 'But 4X games always begin full of promise, at least. StarDrive 2 offers the selection of a space-faring race--always a good time, unless you pick Human--and, if you want, a complete overhauling of its prepackaged traits. The system, like many others in the game, is cribbed directly from Master of Orion, but it remains rousing and balanced. ""Peerless Starfighters"" might sound like a must-have bonus, but can you stomach the ""Repulsive"" or ""Corrupt"" negative trait you\'ll have to equip to zero out the ledgers? And then there are the races themselves: an eclectic bunch that includes Cthulhu-likes, an ursine shogunate, and a narcissistic collection of pods that speak through the hijacked brains of alien owls.', 'As if to further signal that you\'re not supposed to take the ensuing intragalactic war too seriously, there\'s a color commentary robot that periodically interjects to introduce the competing races in a segment called--wait for it--""racial profiling."" And as if to signal that this is a terrible idea for a feature, there\'s also an option to turn it off. But whether you listen to the introductions or not, it behooves you to immediately start spreading out across the star map from whatever randomized homeworld you\'ve been deposited on. Exploratory fleets can be sent across the universe with a click, revealing new planets of varying hospitality to colonize. The best ones go quick--opposing empires in StarDrive 2 gobble up territory, and they\'re not shy about claim jumping either.', 'These enemies can be held off for a time via diplomacy. Technological advancements are divided into mutually exclusive sets of three and are often differentiated by whether they provide an immediate benefit or one that scales better over a longer period of time. Researching one cordons off the other two, so the best way to snag them is through trade. That, in turn, plays out via a now-overly familiar interface, wherein resources and policies are given a unifying currency and exchanged between two empires at something resembling a fair rate. There\'s also a limiting ""tolerance"" meter that hints at a xenophobic civilian population weighing the deal behind the scenes. Combined with a capricious AI and the utilitarian feel of the diplomacy system at large, the meter mostly just contributes to StarDrive 2\'s gravitational pull towards war.', ""If the end justifies the means--and the end involves every race that isn't you being purged from the galaxy--nothing is ever really beyond the pale, is it? The enslavement and bombardment of civilian populations, consequently, are perfectly tenable according to StarDrive 2's rules of engagement (albeit partially lampshaded by the cartoonish aliens and abstractions of the game's model). The infrastructure of a colonized planet is indicated with a list of the buildings it's added, and its farming, manufacturing, and scientific output are represented. As an example, these outputs are represented for the Kulrathi Shogunate by bears holding pitchforks, pickaxes, and beakers, respectively."", ' ', ""To protect them, you kit out a starfleet or two. Here, StarDrive really feels like it's found its wheelhouse. All ships have a single frame housing a few different pre-existing equipment packages, but they're used more effectively when you customize their payloads yourself. The ship editor uses a lo-fi but intuitive version of EVE Online's similar interface, where armor plating, power generation, weapons, and cockpits all take up a certain amount of tiles on a planar overlay atop the ship's frame. A bigger missile launcher is surely more effective, but it'll take up valuable tiles that you might need to use for thrusters or point defenses."", ""If any system isn't being adequately accounted for, you find out quickly when StarDrive 2's ship-to-ship combat plays itself out. When two fleets collide on the star map, they're set down across from each other on a new screen, where they trade maneuvers and lasers semi-autonomously. A pleasant feedback loop plays so you can see how the battles resolve themselves, note deficiencies in your lineup, and run back to the hangar to draw up a suitable counter to the tech your enemy is fielding."", ""It isn't all quite as tidy as opposing empires trading volleys across their borders. StarDrive 2 introduces a refreshing amount of entropy to the system via third-party raids, discoverable anomalies, derelict ships, and mission pop-ups that can throw a wrench into your previous priorities. But these instances frequently mean that you need to engage in ground combat, a half-baked, grid-based affair that sees two squads march up to each other and wail away until one drops."", ' ', 'You can give ground units tools and abilities, too, but they don\'t fundamentally alter the static nature of the combat--if you need to wait 20 turns for an ability to recharge and the enemy hasn\'t spotted you, you might as well press ""next turn"" 20 times until it refreshes. This is silly, because StarDrive 2 has no pressing need to render ground combat. There\'s enough of a draw in the larger scale, ship-based combat and exploration as well as the thrill loot-seeker get from discovering a planet with a unique resource and scrambling to claim it first.', ""But even though these systems achieve competency, they've been done before (and done better) in many other games. So any praise leveled at StarDrive 2 inevitably ends up faint when it's taken alongside other entries in the sci-fi 4X genre. Is that a flaw of a navel-gazing piece of genre fare or of our own tendency to internalize lessons from an empire builder--that there can only be one winner and that existing for the sake of existing isn't enough?""]"Austin Walker,12-May-15,Project CARS Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/project-cars-review/1900-6416137/,8,PC,"['Project CARS doesnt have any unlockables. You dont amass a fleet of high-performance vehicles. You dont buy any new drivetrains or earn prototype engines. You can choose to work your way through a long career of tiered racing events, but even this is optional. You can just as easily start at the highest racing class, with the best cars, facing the toughest competition. Project CARS doesnt deliver a fantasy of accumulation and progress. What it does deliver is a simulation of racing as tense as it is deep.', 'This simulation is rolled out across four modes. The Solo Race and Online modes let you build any race youd like from the set of cars, tracks, motorsport restrictions, realism settings, and weather conditions available. While the range of vehicle types is wide, there are some notable absences: if youre desperate to drive a Ferrari, Porsche, or Honda, for instance, Project CARS isnt going to meet that need. But the cars that are available look appropriately lustrous, and learning each vehicles intricacies offers a singular pleasure. Holding the reins of a growling Ford Mustang is wildly different from zipping around the track in a little superkart.', ' ', 'Career mode puts you in the role of a driver as he or she moves from one tier to another, signing contracts with new teams, earning new sponsorships, and going after self-chosen goals and achievements. A range of motorsports is available, with the low tiers devoted to karts, the middle tiers offering some open-wheel races and GT events, and the top tiers introducing prototype racing series. Its worth restating that this is not a mode about collecting new cars, earning money, or installing fancy new parts. Developer Slightly Mad Studios has instead built a career mode that effectively shuttles you from one race to another, with each event asking you to tackle a new challenge custom-built from the games building blocks.', 'The final mode is the Driver Network, which offers you the chance to compete against other players in an asynchronous time trial challenge. Everyone takes to the same track in the same car and tries to set the top time. At first, this mode was incredibly frustrating. The best players all had times that were much faster than mine, and I couldnt quite work out why. In trying to figure that out, I realized what differentiates Project CARS from its competitors: it opens up all the options from the beginning, gives you as much time as you need, and then asks you to drive, tinker, and repeat until you understand a race, not until you win it but until you understand it.', 'During the first few of hours of play, I didnt get this part of Project CARS. Id slam on the gas down the straightaways, ease into the turns, and follow the racing line, and when my tires lost their grip and my car went spinning off toward the barricades, Id pause the game and hit restart. Playing like this, Project CARS felt like any other realistic racing game from the past decade but a whole lot prettier (and without any of the familiar progression hooks). But then I committed to playing without restarting, and the whole experience transformed. Suddenly, I was spending time in the practice sessions before a race, learning the ins and outs of the turns, and trying to figure out how to tinker with my cars settings to adjust to the particularities of the track. And I found myself running a few more laps during the pre-race qualification because every little advantage meant that much more.', 'Committing to the game this way brought its priorities into focus. Id thought that the time-of-day and weather systems were superficial showcases. I assumed that the god-rays piercing through the trees and the sheets of rain in the night just existed to look pretty. But a sudden downpour halfway through a 30-minute race takes on a whole new character when youve spent the previous 45 minutes tuning your car and deciphering a tracks turns. What was once a little inconvenience was now a catastrophe that needed to be managed. I started paying attention to the little weather forecast at the top of the screen before a race: Cloudy... Hmm... Hmmmmmm.', 'Project CARS doesnt deliver a fantasy of accumulation and progress. What it does deliver is a simulation of racing as tense as it is deep.', 'So why were the folks who topped the rankings so much better than me? Not only because they were better drivers, but because they understood how to tune their cars to better fit the races track and conditions. There are dozens of characteristics for you to learn about, adjust, and test out: change how open your radiator is, modify your gear timing, increase or reduce tire pressure, and even manage your fuel load. Each of these has some effect on your driving, and if you really hope to compete, you cant take a one size fits all approach. You need to learn what all of these options mean.', 'Unfortunately, unless you already know the ins-and-outs of car tuning, this means that youll need to seek help outside the game. The bottom of the tuning screen says that you can ...troubleshoot issues by asking your engineer, but theres not actually a way to do that in the game. Short descriptions of the tuning options give you a broad idea, but for the specifics, youll need to turn to fan-made guides and tutorial videos. This is a problem for Project CARS because it makes approaching the game on its own terms that much harder. Even this one hurdle had me retreating to the way I played before: no tuning, no learning, just brute force and quick restarts.', 'It didnt help that the AI racers in the Career and Solo modes were so inconsistent. With the default difficulty setting, the other drivers varied between smartly aggressive and totally passive. Why should I spend an hour learning how to master the line at the Sonoma Raceway if I can win by a margin of 12 seconds even when I dont put in time studying the track? Couple this with a nasty bug that would randomly switch me from first to last place, and the whole experience went from meditative to monotonous. (I hit that bug four times in 15 hours of play, but even that is too many).', 'The multiplayer modes sidestep the problem of the unpredictable AI, and its in Online competition that Project CARS shines brightest (which makes it a shame that the North American multiplayer community is as small as it is.) Online, it all comes together: its the last lap, and youre fighting for space against a group of 10 other real-life players. You pull ahead, and suddenly youre neck and neck for first place going into the final straightaway. You notice it before your rival does: his car just isnt keeping up with yours. After the race is over and everyone is congratulating everyone else on a good race, your rival says something like, Man, I dont know what happened there. It was like my car just gave out on me. And you cant be sure, but you think that you know its because of how much fuel was left in the tank. Youd tested that during the practice session, and that work paid off.', ' ', 'Thats Project CARS at its best. No experience points. No parts to buy. No cars to add to your collection. The audacious decision to offer everything up front informs the rest of Project CARSs design, making it distinct (and sometimes frustrating). Other games in the genre work like Skinner boxes, offering rewards according to a special schedule designed to keep you hooked. These games offer the fantasy of plodding, constant accumulation or low-stakes (if high-speed) action. Project CARS offers a different fantasy, one thats a little less attractive and a bit harder to enjoy: the fantasy of learning how to do something difficult.']"Kevin VanOrd,12-May-15,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-review/1900-6416135/,10,Xbox One & PS4 & PC,"['Update: Ive now spent time with every version of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, and when it comes to platform differences, the surprises are few, and divergences are a matter of degrees, not orders of magnitude.

The series has always contrasted its world's physical glamor with its intrinsic violence, but never has that contrast been this uneasy, this convulsive. That The Witcher 3 depicts the immediate brutality of battle in great detail is not a surprise; many games fill the screen with decapitated heads and gory entrails. It's the way this incredible adventure portrays the personal tragedies and underhanded opportunities that such battles provide that makes it so extraordinary."", ""It is more than its thematic turbulence that makes The Witcher 3 extraordinary, actually. Excellence abounds at every turn in this open-world role-playing game: excellent exploration, excellent creature design, excellent combat mechanics, excellent character progression. But the moments that linger are those that reveal the deep ache in the world's inhabitants. In one quest, you reunite two lovers, one of which is now a rotting hag, its tongue lasciviously lolling from its mouth. In another, a corpulent spouse-abuser must find a way to love two different lost souls, each of which test the limits of his affection. Don't worry that these vague descriptions spoil important events: they are simple examples of the obstacles every resident faces. On the isles of Skellige and in the city of Novigrad, there is no joy without parallel sorrow. Every triumph demands a sacrifice."", ' ', ""As returning protagonist Geralt of Rivia, you, too, face the anguish of mere existence, sometimes in unexpected, unscripted ways. The central story, which sees you seeking your ward and daughter figure Ciri, as well as contending with the otherworldly force known as the wild hunt, often forces this anguish upon you. But it was my natural exploration of the game's vast expanses that proved most affecting. At one point, I witnessed a woman sentenced to death, doomed to starve after being chained to a rock. It's a chilling sentence, of course, but it was only later, when I accidentally sailed past the tiny island where her corpse still rested, that the horror of her punishment sunk into my heart. The Witcher 3's story did not script this moment; it was merely a passing detail that might have been lost in the waves or overlooked in favor of the harpies circling overhead. Yet there she was, a reminder that my actions--actions that felt righteous and reasonable as I made them--allowed this woman to rot in this faraway place."", ""The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings touched on similar repercussions, but The Witcher 3 makes them personal. Political tensions run as hot as they always have in this series, and your decisions still divert the paths of barons and kings in intriguing ways. But where The Witcher 2's focus on plot came at the expense of characterization, the sequel gives the wartime struggle great heft by giving Geralt intimate connections to every major player. The connection between Ciri and Geralt proves to be the story's strongest driving force, but Ciri is not a damsel to be rescued, though it may seem so at first, especially in this particular world. This is a place where women struggle to find respect as political candidates, as armorsmithing masters, and even as proper members of a functioning culture."", 'Roasting a crowd of witch hunters is not only satisfying on its own terms, but has a sweet justice to it: the first steps you make in the city of Novigrad lead you to a witch-burning in progress.', ""Women, as it happens, are also this story's strongest force. If you have played a Witcher game before, you know many of them already. The most powerful of them are former members of the Lodge of Sorceresses, few of them outright likable, and each of them defiant in the face of death. In certain circumstances, you take control of Ciri herself, and she wields swords just as capably as a witcher does. (Her phantom dashes also bring a zippiness to her sections that Geralt lacks.) The occasional dose of gratuitous toplessness sometimes proves to be a needle scratch, particularly in a sauna scene that seems to have been constructed specifically to get you up close and personal with a woman's anatomy. In other moments, however, the nudity is a natural element of a scene's sensuality, such as the tutorial scene that features Yennefer and Geralt sharing a relaxed intimacy that surpasses the obvious physical connection."", 'The Witcher 3 is enormous in scope, though ""big"" is just a descriptor, a statement of neither good nor bad. It is fortunate, then, that The Witcher 3 does not subscribe to the ""make a big world and fill it with copy-paste content"" design philosophy. Instead, it finds a nigh-perfect sense of balance between giving you things to do and allowing its spaces to breathe. You follow a path not just because there\'s a question mark on your map, but also because it must lead somewhere new and interesting. The intrigue builds naturally: Every quest is a story of sadness or triumph waiting to absorb you, asking you to make decisions that change the landscape in various ways. You won\'t always know what the consequences are; some decisions have noticeable, game-altering repercussions, while others barely draw your gaze. But the consequences are there, and you often notice them, even though the game doesn\'t go out of its way to call attention to them.', ' ', 'Of course, story quests, side quests, and monster-killing contracts typically involve the same set of activities: killing, talking, and activating your witcher senses, which reveal footprints and scent trails and turn Geralt into a particularly violent private investigator. It is the details that keep every task as inviting as the one that came before. It might be a change of scenery that turns an otherwise typical contract into a clash for the ages: you pull out your crossbow and shoot a screaming wyvern out of the sky with a well-placed bolt, then plunge your silver sword into its heart, all while a fire rages in the outpost beyond and lightning bolts tear across the dark sky. It might be fear that disrupts your state of mind: you search for spirits as you trudge through a murky swamp, lighting the mist with the green light that emanates from your magical lantern. The Witcher 3 makes grand gestures and small ones, too; you may battle werewolves and match wits with kings and barons, but hearing an angel-voiced trobairitz sing a plaintive ballad is a stunning show-stopper.', 'The writing can be best described as ""lusty."" Many of the land\'s inhabitants serve a god, but their gods have no apparent problem with them making murderous accusations and shouting obscenities. It\'s fitting that these people would turn to the gods yet curse them in turn, given fields ravaged by battle and littered with bloated corpses. There are a few moments that reveal the screenplay\'s seams: some of Geralt\'s lines may not make sense if you choose them in a particular order, for instance, and Geralt is concerned only with money and prefers to stay out of politics, except for when he\'s not like that at all, because the plot demands as much. But at least the witcher\'s signature dry growl remains intact, and the rambunctious Irish and Scottish accents that pervade particular regions may inspire you to head to the pub and grab a pint.', ' ', ' ', ""As cutting as some characters' wit may be (Sigismund Dijkstra's sarcastic barbs make him one of the game's foul-mouthed delights), you do most of your cutting with the blades sheathed on your back. The Witcher 2's combat was overly demanding at the outset, but The Witcher 3 is substantially easier; I recommend, in fact, that you choose a difficulty level one notch higher than the one you would typically choose, presuming you don't default to the most stringent one straight away. Even when things get easy, however, the combat is always satisfying, due to the crunchiness of landing blows, the howls of human foes scorched by your Igni sign, and the fearsome behavior of necrophages, wandering ghosts, and beasts of the indescribable sort. It's easy to get sidetracked and outlevel story quests, but even lesser beasts require a bit of finesse; drowners attack in numbers, for instance, knocking you about and making it difficult to swing, while winged beasts swoop in for a smackdown and require you to blast them down with a flash of fire, a shockwave, or a crossbow bolt."", 'The familiar magical signs return in The Witcher 3. Geralt is no mage, but he still calls on the powers of magic to assist him in combat. Character advancement is substantially improved over the previous games, providing not just passive improvements to your magical trap and your force-push technique, but also altering their very behavior. Casting Igni, for instance, initially produces a brief flash of flames. Certain upgrades, however, allow you to spray a stream of flames for as long as your energy supply supports it. Roasting a crowd of witch hunters in this way is not only satisfying on its own terms, but has a sweet justice to it: the first steps you make in the city of Novigrad lead you to a witch-burning in progress. How appropriate that you turn this punishment on the same factions that would rid the world of sorceresses and their cohorts.', 'The Witcher 3 finds a nigh-perfect sense of balance between giving you things to do and allowing its spaces to breathe.', ""Loot has a huge role to play in the game, thanks to the high degree of armor and weapon customization. Different armor sets in particular are a joy to uncover, making Geralt look more and more hardened as you progress. In many role-playing games, hunting for treasure is more of a chore to be marked off of the to-do list than a pressing adventure of its own. In The Witcher 3, discovering a diagram of new and improved chest armor is a cause for celebration. Geralt can get a shave and a haircut (and delightfully, his beard grows back over time), but otherwise, you cannot customize his physical appearance; new armor means a new look, and with it, a new visual attitude. Geralt's look evolves from that of a battered soldier, to robed battle wizard, to wisened commander, all on the basis of the game's exquisite armor designs."", 'The Witcher 3 also benefits from its hugely expanded potions system, which allows you to quaff potions during combat--though as always, witcher potions are dangerous, and Geralt can only have so many in effect due to their rising toxicity. Between gear diagrams and potion ingredients, I became a digital hoarder, a trap I typically avoid in role-playing games. Again, it comes down to balance: your inventory fills rapidly, but for the most part, this is not just ""stuff"" for the sake of ""stuff."" I knew that the ingredients I collected would allow me to create a potion that in turn let me dive for treasure without being annoyed by pesky sea-dwelling drowners. I knew that I could break down those horse hides I collected into armor components the local smith needed to make me look even mightier.', ' ', 'From one hour to the next, the compulsion to examine the landscape grows. Some of the joys that arise in the wilds are quiet ones: you mount your horse Roach and trot over the hill in time to see a rich sunset, always a treat in The Witcher 3, whose saturated reds and oranges make the sky look as beautiful and as blood-sodden as the meadows beneath them. You discover a boat and embark on an impromptu voyage through the islands of Skellige, taking note of the ship wreckage that mars the beaches and cliffs. The music swells, and a soprano intones a euphoric melody that accentuates the peacefulness. The peacefulness is always broken, however--perhaps by a journey into a dark dungeon where your torch lights the pockmarked walls and a snarling fiend waits to devour you, or by the shout of a boy crying out for your assistance.', ""The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is undoubtedly beautiful regardless of platform, though prone to occasional bugs and visual glitches. Solving a quest's subtasks in a particular order caused the game to stick at a perpetual loading screen. Roach decided to stop galloping and lurch ahead in a weird way for minutes on end until I quick-traveled away and returned. Geralt's hair blew in the wind, even when he was indoors. It's jarring should you enter an area after quick-traveling and the citizens have yet to pop in, including quest-givers. Along with occasional console frame rate jitters, these elements may prove distracting to you should they arise, depending on your level of tolerance; even so, Geralt's newest adventure is such an achievement that I was rarely disturbed by the glitches I encountered."", ' ', ""These distractions stand out in part because The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is otherwise incredible and sumptuous; the little quirks are pronounced when they are surrounded by stellar details. And make no mistake: this is one of the best role-playing games ever crafted, a titan among giants and the standard-setter for all such games going forward. Where the Witcher 2 sputtered to a halt, The Witcher 3 is always in a crescendo, crafting battle scenarios that constantly one-up the last, until you reach the explosive finale and recover in the glow of the game's quiet denouement. But while the grand clashes are captivating, it is the moments between conflicts, when you drink with the local clans and bask in a trobairitz's song, that are truly inspiring.""]"Janine Hawkins,12-May-15,Toren Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/toren-review/1900-6416133/,5,PC,"[""When you're reflecting on a recently completed game, hating it is just as helpful a feeling as loving it. Whether your opinions are glowing or scathing, strong feelings in either direction mean that you'll have plenty to share with others when the topic comes up. It's the middling game--inoffensive but unremarkable--that really haunts you. I don't feel any regret about the time I expended playing Toren, but that's the problem. I don't really feel much about that time at all."", ""In Toren, you direct a small girl known as Moonchild to the top of a crumbling tower. Like the tower of Babel, it was built by people seeking great power who were punished severely for their hubris. Mankind's last hope is a girl trapped inside the tower, doomed to die and be reborn endlessly until she can scale it and slay the dragon that shares her prison. It's a web of myth and mysticism where each individual thread is vaguely familiar but has been woven into something distinct and original."", ""Moonchild starts as a toddler stumbling around the overgrown lower level, but the endearingly uncoordinated flopping of her limbs gives way to composure and poise the farther she progresses up the tower. The enchanted sword that takes all her strength to first lift is soon wielded with ease. Aspects of Moonchild's maturation are handled very well, including her evolving design, with one notable exception. In her awkward preteen stage, her childhood dress tears into a convenient deep V-neckline with straps slipping away from her shoulders and three large round gaps in the cloth exposing the majority of her back. This is not what happens when someone outgrows a piece of clothing, and considering that the player saw this same character toddling around in baby bloomers about thirty minutes prior, this phase of her costume evolution comes off as somewhat creepy."", ""The actual act of climbing the tower involves solving relatively simple environmental puzzles, fending off assorted enemies, and exploring optional dream sequences where Moonchild's mentor explains her situation and some broader philosophical musings about the nature of mankind. This is where the your experience can be seriously derailed; if you skip these optional (and easily missed) sequences, it becomes quite hard to follow the plot. You'll never want for those lofty chin-stroking tidbits, though, even though they're some of the least interesting things the game has to say."", ""Storytelling gripes aside, the hands-on feel of playing isn't great either. The best illustration of this comes in the form of the shapes that Moonchild must fill with sand during her dreams. Each dream has at least one of these to complete, and to do so, you hold down the interact button and direct her around the shape's outline. The game very weakly snaps her to the path, but it's incredibly easy to stray. It's even easier if you disregard the warnings and elect to play with a mouse and keyboard instead. (Don't do this. Seriously.) These sand tracings are the most annoying part of the game; even when you perform well (controller and all), it looks like Moonchild has spread the sacred sand with as much care as a toddler spilling cereal all over the kitchen floor."", ""I wish my problems with Toren ended there, but I can't leave out the times that I somehow managed to wedge Moonchild in places where the camera steadfastly refused to follow, the times when she simply slipped through the floor geometry and fell into oblivion, the times when Moonchild's arms froze in place while her legs continued to animate normally, the times that her sword hit foes with so little effect that I kept attacking, not realizing that they were already dead, the times that I took a jump too early but the game graciously floated me over to the destination platform as though I'd triggered some sort of moon gravity mode, the time that I fought the dragon, fudged the timing, and darted back to regroup before it could perform its you're too slow instant kill... only for the game to snap Moonchild back into its talons anyway."", ""And yet Toren is not without its charms. In spite of some conspicuously low-quality models, it's a delightful thing to look at: its colors are vivid, its world is small but detailed, and it doesn't shy away from dramatic use of its camera and lighting effects. A couple of the dream sequences elicited quiet gasps as I proceeded through them, and even the credits (which feature painted illustrations unfurled to a vocal version of the game's beautiful theme) are worth watching."", ""For all the problems, it's easy to recognize the flashes of something special in Toren. It's a loaf of homemade bread, proofed and kneaded, laid in a pan, and sprinkled tenderly with rosemary but unfortunately pulled from the oven a few minutes before it could pass the toothpick test. However complex the recipe, Toren just feels undercooked.""]"Don Saas,11-May-15,Inside My Radio Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/inside-my-radio-review/1900-6416132/,7,PC,"[""I'm a firm believer that all skills, even the ones we often think of as innate--artistic talent, athletic ability, imaginative writing--can be taught. It's just a matter of putting the time and effort into learning to excel (or at least be competent) at something. Rhythm is the exception to that rule. You either have it or you don't. And I do not. The only reason I could play drums in Rock Band was because of the falling note chart in the game. That I was able to enjoy the rhythmic platforming of Inside My Radio despite my total lack of an inner metronome is a testament to its hypnotic power."", ""Seaven Studio's Inside My Radio is a hybrid of Thomas Was Alone's geometric platforming and the beat-dependent movement of 2012's criminally underselling Sound Shapes. On a surface covered with blocks set against old-school backdrops, you explore levels through rhythmic jumping, dashing, and smashing. Beyond basic left/right movement, you can only perform more complex actions in time with the rhythm of the level's music. Featuring rock, electronic, and even reggae tunes, Inside My Radio forces you to become one with the soundtrack's tempos in order to avoid the varied obstacles in the environments themselves."", ""If you're wanting a game that is perfect for a chill evening where you want to relax with music and a video game, Inside My Radio is worth the spin."", ""Much like Sound Shapes, Inside My Radio successfully cultivates a sense of synesthesia in players--the ability to experience music with your senses beyond hearing. It's partially achieved through the core mechanical loop of the game: overcoming environmental obstacles through rhythm. If you can't find the tempo of that level's track, you aren't going to get very far. But once you discover the song's groove, you begin to feel a sense of oneness between the music and your platforming. Well, you do if you have any rhythm. I don't, but even I began to get the groove of Inside My Radio once I took a couple deep breaths and focused on the sound."", ""But it's more than mechanical design that creates the multisensory musical experience. The environments react to the music. The dub level has trees that grow and unfurl in time to the beats. The most devious platforming segments require an understanding of the beat to conquer. The puzzles work around the polyrhythms of the most complex tracks. Every element of Inside My Radio feeds back into the music. Music becomes the mechanics. It becomes the art. And when you learn that this guitar riff means the fatal electric platform is going to disappear before it even happens, the game has accomplished its goal of creating an immersive sonic experience."", 'Inside My Radio has an actual plot as well, though it\'s fairly nonsensical and mostly serves as an excuse to have the characters you control explore these varied worlds--including what appears to be the literal inside of a radio, a dance club, and the abstraction of a Rasta/electronic fusion. The game also relies on an unnecessary preponderance of pop culture humor/meme references that fall a little flat in its storytelling. The jokes rarely seem to serve a purpose beyond ""Aren\'t we clever for knowing this bit of cultural ephemera?""', ""And despite the great soundtrack and the trance-inducing interplay between music, game art, and mechanics, the platforming and art are merely good. Your dash mechanic is key to traversing many of the game's obstacles, but it feels loose and imprecise, which is rarely a major issue but becomes frustrating when it does rear its head. The art can become a phantasmagoric, psychedelic delight, but the game also embraces staid, bland cyberpunk electroscapes that feel rote by the end of the game. Boss fights against a cyber-spider crop up at the end of the game, and they are more aggravating than hypnotic. Inside My Radio also suffers from the inclusion of an occasional puzzle where you might not even realize you're trying to solve a puzzle at first, and it interrupts the musical momentum of the game."", ""Inside My Radio never quite reaches the synergetic highs of its most obvious peer, Sound Shapes, but it's still an entrancing experience. Although the main campaign is very short (it takes less than two hours to complete), the Time Attack mode adds legs to the game for those who wish to truly master the game's levels. If you're wanting a game that is perfect for a chill evening where you want to relax with music and a video game, Inside My Radio is worth a spin.""]"Justin Clark,8-May-15,Kerbal Space Program Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/kerbal-space-program-review/1900-6416128/,9,PC,"['Two astronauts are dead. And they represent one of my greatest achievements in a video game.', ""Of course it's terrible that the two Kerbals--an entire species of little green alien men who feel like an unholy combination of the Minions from Despicable Me and the Irken race from Invader Zim--are dead. I managed to keep them alive through disaster after disaster, spending hours ensuring to their survival in the cold black of space. Test missions were flown; probes collected scientific data; rockets would refuse to leave the ground and would explode or launch and then immediately tip over because the balance was wrong. These two died based on the collective knowledge of a thousand failures. And it was beautiful because they died crashing into the Moon."", 'Sorry, the Mun.', ' ', ""It doesn't really cover it to say that Kerbal Space Program is a space sim. For one thing, no matter how serious things get, you're still playing in a world of little green cartoons, which the game never really reconciles with its overwhelming physical realism the further along you go. But for all the things that feel brain-bending and sciencey, there's still a mild sense of approachability, like the fact that trying to plot a flight path that puts you in orbit with a different planet is essentially a really touchy and precise game of Bop It. The game surpasses that categorization because of that sense of constant discovery and innovation. Making a mistake never felt like a punishment, as if the game had placed an insurmountable obstacle in front of me and laughed as I flailed wildly at it. It felt like growth. Failure is a teacher here, one that challenges you and doesn't compromise by handing you all the answers. But it is most certainly a teacher that wants nothing more than for you to find enlightenment."", 'As such, trying to nutshell Kerbal Space Program isn\'t a matter of straightforward ""You win if you get here"" goals. As far as I can tell, the game never stops, and an entire solar system waits out there to be explored. What KSP values above all is perseverance. Although all your scientists and pilots are little green men, the game is intrinsically human. You advance simply by being bold enough to try reaching a little higher, making your species\' sphere of influence just a little larger with every attempt. If you manage to break the world\'s speed record, you\'re ready to try reaching the upper atmosphere and recording how the air is up there. If you get there, then maybe we can put a satellite even further. If the satellite can get up there, maybe an astronaut can. If we can reach space, we can reach our closest planetary neighbor. All that matters is that the experience is never wasted. Whether you transmit the knowledge using an antenna you attached to your spacecraft or you manage to land safely and the data can be recovered manually, Mission Control receives the experience, shown under a blanket stat of ""Science"" in-game. If the mission crashes and burns horribly, it is worthwhile as long as you recognize why.', 'Unsurprisingly, most of your time in-game is spent in the spaceport on a constant trial-and-error mode trying to build a craft that can do exactly what\'s required for the mission at hand. The game isn\'t going to blow your mind visually or aurally--land, sea, space are all relatively textureless and sparse, even with all the specs cranked up, and the sounds are about the same, with the soundtrack topping out at ""playfully quirky"" instead of awe-inspiring. All the horsepower has gone into making the fine kinetic details almost terrifyingly intricate. Virtually every aspect of a spaceship\'s design is accounted for here, with literally hundreds of design options and moving parts to assemble--from fuel tanks and rockets to the heat shields for re-entry and the decoupling devices for boosters. And youd better take all of it into consideration or sure as you\'re born, it will crash and burn before you even see the stars. It\'s daunting, but starting small and adding new tech onto successful structures is where joy is found. The actual crafting process is dirt simple, however, because every part is basically attached to your craft like Legos. There\'s a slew of fine-tuning tools available for the more meticulous player, but it takes a long time before they become necessary evils.', 'Kerbal Space Program offers straightforward Easy-to-Hard difficulty settings, but in reality, the real difficulty setting is almost allegorical. The Sandbox mode opens up every available part in the game so you can just fool around and make the most elaborate, insane designs imaginable. The Science mode allows you to earn points for every new milestone achievement; you can spend those points on the Research and Development skill tree, which is where you earn bigger and better parts to use. The Career mode is a full-blown space program experience where money is, in fact, an object and good public opinion, public donations, government contracts, and farmed-out tech are required to before you can even afford to send astronauts on a flight. This is the most ""gamey"" it gets, with contracts representing clearly defined missions you can perform to get the most out of every flight. It\'s slow going, but its possibly the most satisfying because every new advancement is earned.', ""Both the Science and Sandbox modes feature pre-made spacecraft you can take out into the final frontier, but while it is a huge relief to not have to put in the clearly elaborate wrench time to build anything this complex, there's something a little hollow about just having these accomplishments tossed at you instead of reaching them yourself. The game almost makes up for this because even with a few extensive tutorials tossed in, getting a ship to the Mun involves a hundred tiny decisions you won't realize youre making because you dont have to make them time and time again. The stages of every launch have to be programmed in, sufficient fuel has to be stocked to make it where you're going and back, and ship stability has to be minded (even with the SAS feature, which is there for the express purpose of keeping your ship in balance). The blue navigation ball at the bottom of your screen is your best friend in the world, and ignoring it is a fool's act. Career mode is harder yet infinitely more satisfying when you find success. Even when you forge the most ridiculous-looking rocket, its a wonder of engineering as long as it breaches Kerbal's atmosphere and doesn't explode. True human achievement, in life as in this game, works at a snail's pace. It can't be given."", 'Once you have your spacecraft, the real struggle begins. And your opponent is gravity.', ""Gravity keeps your craft from lifting off when you've loaded it down with too much rocket fuel. It tilts your ship as it takes off if the thrust is even a tiny angle off-kilter. You fight it in the upper atmosphere as you try to put spacecraft in orbit instead of watching them fall helplessly back to the ground. You will charge against it as you try to create a new orbital path to get to a new planet, and all the tutorials do is teach you the basic principles. They don't tell you what parts you need to make these things any easier in practice (in case you haven't figured it out, the tutorials are kinda useless)."", ""You advance simply by being bold enough to try reaching a little higher, making your species' sphere of influence just a little larger with every attempt."", ""But this is simply nature in action. Unlike, say, Surgeon Simulator or one of the new breed of indie titles with sloppy, inebriate physics, KSP's natural laws feel like a natural part of the universes uncaring nature instead of the developers attempt to stymie progress. It's up to you to use the tech at your disposal to break nature's shackles and crack the science necessary. This is often an arduous, aggravating process, where hours slip away as you try to find the one flaw in an insanely elaborate series of maneuvers thats causing your missions to fail. The tiny moments when something clicks into place and one more of those chains breaks are the most breathtaking and gratifying of all. Once again, there's still even further you can go."", 'Kerbal Space Program was a beta release for years before this, its ""final"" version. Funny enough, even after all that time, bugs are still scattered throughout, such as ships that are no longer visible, orbital paths turning twitchy and changing randomly even as your ship follows the one you set, and button presses not registering as you float out of your ship . But these are small compared to what feels like the mass achievements of thousands of minds bringing their expertise to the table through the hundreds of tweaks done over the years to the clearly passionate, lovingly crafted mods, which are easily accessible and promoted in-game. Even NASA\'s gotten in on it with a few of their own hypothetical scenarios pre-loaded in the game from the get-go. On the micro and macro levels, Kerbal Space Program\'s greatest magic trick is giving the player a feeling of togetherness, that we all have the same curiosity required to transcend our limitations and that regardless of how Herculean the stakes, the constant idea is always ""it can be done.""', ' ', ""You will fail at this game. It will demoralize you and it will stress you out, but, more often than not, it will soothe, quiet, and inspire you. Innovative muscles will be stretched here that aren't stretched very often by games, and more complex moments require a sort of zen beyond being simply twitch-ready for a surprise attack. Even failure imparts a lesson. No matter how big or small the achievement, anything else that can be done is limited only by your imagination.

Every hole is hosted on its own little cloud, creating a surreal atmosphere that is both whimsical and slightly disturbing (a mood that is emphasized by a morose piano soundtrack that reminded me of something the Phantom of the Opera would noodle around with in his lair). Nearly two dozen courses of varying length and difficulty are featured, and all are loaded with eccentric features that make them play out like puzzles. It's reminiscent of the classic Mouse Trap board game, lavishly accentuated with tips of the (top) hat to the Gilded Age. Holes boast multiple levels, ramps, sliding platforms, moving rollers and carpets, lavish Oriental rugs in place of plastic grass, luxurious metal railings and fences, Victrola horns sprouting up like metallic flowers, steam tubes that fire balls up and down, fans that blow balls to and fro, special holes that take a stroke off your score, and much more. It's all compellingly trippy, and it makes every hole as much about solving puzzles as it is about mini-golf heroics."", ""Accoutrements unavailable in terrestrial mini-golf help with these out-there challenges. You can switch from the traditional putter to a chipper when you aren't on the green in many circuits. This lets you shoot longer distances and get the ball off the ground. Holes can be scouted from a distance with a remote-control robot hummingbird. A little jet on the ball called a bug (which actually looks more like an electrified Faberge egg than anything produced by Nike or Top Flite) can be activated on a limited basis to move toward the cup (a big help on the often curvy greens) or put the brakes on if your shot is going long. A rewind bar powers the ability to pull back bad shots--at least for a limited time, as it drains fairly quickly as you deploy the feature. And multiplayer mode can become a zany free-for-all, with players using various weapons to attack rivals. Bombs knock balls right off the course, slime sticks balls in place, and mini whirlwinds send shots all over the place. It's just a shame that the multiplayer servers are so vacant right now."", 'Gameplay remains true to real mini-golf while still embracing the bizarre series of puzzles that are crammed into every hole. I was constantly forced to plan out my approaches in advance, and choose to either play it safe and try something conventional like a bank shot or go crazy and attempt something such as chipping the ball over a bank of fans onto a rolling platform so that I could catch the green without careening off the edge of the course and plummeting thousands of feet to the ground below. But even though the structure of the holes elevates the stakes of the game well past the windmills of terrestrial mini-golf, the heart of the game is still about making the shots when needed.', ""Ultimately, the challenge is two-fold. Not only do you need to putt for dough, you also always need to be thinking two or three shots ahead. As a result, the game can be impressively difficult, especially when playing the tougher Median and Dark Hole courses (these can be as difficult to follow as an MC Escher print), as opposed to the pick-up-and-play mini-putt ones. I found that I had to learn these harder holes with a few run-throughs (even with the hummingbird contraption, which wasn't nearly as useful as experiencing the holes first-hand) before I even had a chance at finishing close to par."", 'Every hole is hosted on its own little cloud, creating a surreal atmosphere that is both whimsical and slightly disturbing.', 'All this trial and error can be frustrating, and I initially felt like I was being cheated. But the sheer necessity of learning holes also pumped up the replay value, as I kept going back for more. Such intense early difficulty pushed me to better my scores. I particularly enjoyed the speed rounds and the driving range for their many challenges, which made them feel as much like logic puzzles as mini-golf. Discovering smart routes to pins and then actually pulling them off was incredibly satisfying.', ""A few problems are caused by the visuals and the controls. The camera can be very awkward to maneuver, mainly when you're close to the cup, as these areas are often enclosed. Shooting with the ball up against a grilled glass wall can be nearly impossible simply because you cant get a good look at the hole. Controls are a little lacking in finesse, no matter if you use the mouse, keyboard, or gamepad. Instead of the expected light touch, the club pulls back in a somewhat jerky fashion. As a result, it is all too easy to fire a rocket when you want a gentle tap. In-game physics are very rigorous at the cup, too. Any ball moving a touch too fast will skip past the hole, and balls only rarely grab the lip and roll in as they will in real golf."", ""I'm not sure how big the audience for dystopian steampunk mini-putt in the sky is. But if you've got a hankering to see what fictional high-tech Victorians would do with this staple of modern amusement parks, you can find out with the oddly captivating Vertiginous Golf. Its puzzling, challenging, and deeply weird characteristics make for a unique and engaging experience that brings new life to the staidest of sports.""]"Britton Peele,8-May-15,Lost Orbit Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/lost-orbit-review/1900-6416131/,7,PS4,"['Youd think that being alone and adrift in outer space, with neither a ship nor a way to communicate with civilization, would be a slow affair (and almost certainly lead to a depressing death). You might expect to gradually float through the void, pondering your life choices as you starve to death. According to Lost Orbit, however, you can make it home in one piece as long as you hurtle past asteroids, orbit some planets, avoid some lasers, and make a robot friend along the way.', ""You are Harrison, a maintenance worker sent out alone to repair a comm relay far from civilization. While making the repairs, your ship blows up, leaving you with nothing but a spacesuit that evidently has an infinite supply of thruster fuel. At first glance, Lost Orbit resembles an old-school arcade shoot-em-up. You can only move left and right at the bottom of the screen as the action automatically scrolls forward. The biggest difference, though, is that there is no shooting here, only dodging. You want a high score at the end of a level? Then you're going to have to dodge stuff while moving really fast."", ""The breakneck speeds you can reach in Lost Orbit evoke some of the same excitement you might get from a fast, arcade-style racing game. Boosting and zig-zagging your way through clumps of asteroids and other obstacles isn't too different from weaving through traffic in a game like Burnout, and it brings with it the same risk: If you collide with a hard surface, the result is going to be messy. Moving rapidly through tight, dangerous spaces is exhilarating, but a slight twitch in the wrong direction could mean instant death."", 'It\'s not just chunks of rock you have to worry about. As you make your way home, you encounter old machinery, lasers, aliens, and more potentially deadly perils. Then there are the objects that aren\'t necessarily deadly but still affect your flight path, like wormholes that teleport you across the screen, pulsars that push you away, gas giants that give you a boost of speed, planets you can orbit around, and more. Oh, and did you think you\'d only be dodging everything? You also must collect bright purple pieces of ""obtainium,"" which contribute to your score and allow you to buy permanent upgrades.', ""So there's a lot going on, but thankfully, moving around feels natural, though it may not be what you expect at first. Your character is flying through space in an Iron Man-like fashion. When you tilt the analog stick left or right, you actually tilt his body left or right in the same way you might bank an airplane (albeit a very agile one). Tilt hard enough, and you actually begin to loop around, allowing you to do a quick 180 if you know you don't have room to dodge an obstacle. It doesn't take long to get a handle on how to move exactly the way you want, giving you great precision even at high speeds."", ""One clever method for getting out of harm's way is to wrap around the screen. If you venture off the right side of the screen, you re-appear on the left and vice versa. If wrapping doesn't provide a large enough safety net, you can spend the obtanium you collect on a few new abilities, including a faster boost (one that's more limited in its usage, making it more like nitrous in a racing game); a barrel roll you can use to move left and right more quickly; and the ability to slow down, which is a vital skill to have while zooming through space. You can also buy the game's lone offensive ability: a bomb that blows up certain obstacles in your immediate vicinity."", ""When everything comes together and your reflexes are sharp, the speed and precision of Lost Orbit's 2D gameplay would make Sonic the Hedgehog jealous. Boosting through a cluster of asteroids, narrowly dodging turret fire, orbiting around one planet to refill your boost meter then dashing through another to get an extra burst of speed...there's a lot of timing to get down, but when you nail it, everything feels fluid. The sense of accomplishment you get when you make it through a level while barely slowing down is addicting."", ""It also looks great in motion, making good use of subtle but effective character animations combined with flashy colors and visual effects. Even dying has its own special touch. There are plenty of death animations (usually of the over-the-top comedic violence variety) to marvel at, provided you don't hit the reset button as quickly as possible every time you make a mistake."", ""The story has a striking element of charm to it. Harrison's adventure is narrated by a similarly lonesome robot with some humorously tragic (and sometimes touching) things to say. The downside is that while this commentary is interesting the first time through, it's not as appealing when you replay levels multiple times either to improve on your last performance or simply because you keep dying. Hearing the same lines of dialogue repeated over and over grows tiresome quickly, and there doesn't seem to be any way to turn the narration off."", ""When everything comes together and your reflexes are sharp, the speed and precision of Lost Orbit's 2D gameplay would make Sonic the Hedgehog jealous."", ""Levels in Lost Orbit are short and usually beatable in a couple of minutes at most. Checkpoints scattered throughout them make completing the game a short, relatively easy task. The game's roughly 40 stages can be completed within two or three hours if you're not worried about how you're ranked at the end of each one. If you do want to be rewarded with a platinum medal for each level (or a high spot on the time trial leaderboards), though, you'll want to get through each one as quickly as possible without dying while collecting every piece of obtanium along the way. This is a fun challenge, though there's a bit of frustration involved every time you want to try a stage again. While there's a button dedicated to restarting a stage quickly, the reset isn't instant, forcing you to wait a few seconds every time you want to go back to the beginning of a stage. That might not sound too bad, but if you keep messing up halfway through a level, it's frustrating to not be able to go back instantly. Games with similar time-based leaderboards, like Super Meat Boy, have spoiled us with their instant restart abilities."", ""Due in part to its brevity, Lost Orbit isn't the most memorable of adventures. You barrel through its levels quickly, and unless you want to try for faster time trial scores, there's not a lot to come back for. Still, the rush of speed and the simple charms of the animation and narration make this game a blast while it lasts.""]"Cameron Woolsey,8-May-15,Verdun Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/verdun-review/1900-6416130/,6,PC,"['The Battle of Verdun began in February 1916, and lasted ten months. It was the lengthiest battle during World War I, claiming around 700,000 dead, wounded, or missing soldiers. The multiplayer first-person shooter Verdun revisits this tragic time, bringing to life the fear and thrill, as well as the boredom, of trench warfare. Verdun takes a risk; it is a rare shooter set in a time period more frequently visited by strategy games. It gets close to capturing the essence of battle, despite being stymied by the realities of the often slow pace of the Great War, and all the while stumbling on its own obstacles.', ""Most of your time in Verdun is spent in its Frontlines mode. Here, two teams take turns crossing no man's land in an attempt to take their opponents' trench. It's a game of momentum. When you're on the offensive, the game allows you to charge onto the battlefield as your opponents line up in defense. Taking an enemy trench requires that you survive long enough to reach and occupy it, driving out combatants. Like in Battlefield, the more allies you have, the faster the trench is taken, and the faster you gain a point. But taking the trench won't be easy. Enemies have the advantage when you're on offense, and if your team is kept away until the end of a timer, momentum transfers to the opposing team, and soon it's their turn to charge, putting you on defense. The more you capture, the deeper the battle moves in the map toward enemy headquarters--the final goal of Frontlines. Battles switch constantly from offense to defense throughout the match, and winning outright doesn't come easy. Of all the games I played, nearly half ended in a draw. There is also a rifles-only team Deathmatch mode to consider, but the population of competing players is considerably lower than Frontlines'."", 'Keeping you in the World War I tug-of-war fantasy, the game introduces a ""dead zone"" that surrounds each of the enormous maps, and keeps you out of the field between trench lines during defense. If your team fails to capture an enemy trench, you\'re given a countdown timer and forced to retreat to your own line; otherwise, you are executed. You\'re not allowed to put even one toe past these lines, even if they lie mere inches in front of your own trench. Stepping over causes the colors to fade, and a countdown emerges, pulling you from the experience with the subtlety of a cracking whip. It can get frustrating to deal with, as you\'re sometimes unable to gain a better viewing angle without your own soldier barking a line about deserters getting shot the moment you move too far. It\'s especially irritating when you pass over the line while moving through dug-out trenches or clearly defined pathways on the battlefield.', ""Frontlines mode focuses on squad-based combat. Loading into a match, you get placed into a squad and fill a specific role. Some squads focus on recon, while others are attack squads that include positions for riflemen and grenadiers. Depending on the squad type, the squad leader--a non-commissioned officer, or NCO--can call in special commands such as artillery support, airplane recon, or gas assaults. Playing in a squad is highly encouraged--not only is it just short of impossible to take out a trench on your own, but it makes the game a lot more engaging. I struggled during the first several hours, grumbling every time I got killed off in some ditch or another, but Verdun opened up once I learned how to work with my squad. Communicating when and where to attack made the charging offense not only more realistic, but also made it feel like a managed, well-oiled machine. Over time, your squad levels up, unlocking bonuses such as new uniforms and status buffs. Collecting experience points happens naturally as you play, but you gain a lot more by playing with a squad. It's a much faster way to earn levels and career points, the latter of which allows you to open up new weapon tiers for your chosen class. Over time, you gain access to new and more powerful rifles, pistols, and mounted machine guns."", ""There is one reality of the Great War that Verdun can't escape: tedium. There are moments of boredom while desperately waiting for something to get you out of the trench. It can be a pervasive burden that may cause you, as it did me, to sprint from one end of the trench to the other in the hope that action eventually presents itself. The feeling is magnified by the respawn times, which can force you to cool your heels for twenty seconds at a time or longer--and respawning doesn't always play into your favor. There were many instances where I returned to the battlefield with a relieved sigh, only for a vigilant sniper to send me immediately back to the death screen with another twenty-plus-second wait. When most games run from fifteen to thirty minutes, expect a lot of dead air between the chaos of charges and sweeping out enemy trenches."", 'A lack of variety is another hindrance. Many of the maps are expectedly ugly, pockmarked with craters and devoid of much vegetation. Some fronts, however, are lusher than others, introducing trees to stack up against, along with swaying grass and bushes that add a welcome palette of color. But for the most part, the differing shades of brown with the intermittent splash of green is not a blessing to the eyes. And yes, of course I realize the battlefields of World War I were never attractive, but the aesthetic gets tiring. Beyond the art, Frontlines mode itself rarely deviates from its design, which begins to drag after many hours.', ""However, Verdun does deliver rare moments of inspiration when bursts of excitement and terror shatter the monotony. A bullet fired from an unseen enemy rips through the air, striking a fellow soldier just to your side. In your peripheral vision you see him collapse limply into the mud. You drop down and your mind races. Will you move locations and pop back up to scan the horizon for the killer? Are you meant to avenge your lost comrade, or join him? Back inside the trench, there is often barely enough room for two soldiers to pass by, sometimes resulting in both getting momentarily stuck as they attempt to move to another section in need of defense, all while bullets fly inches overhead, and more bodies drop. It can be scary and terribly claustrophobic at times. When enemy commanders drop choking clouds of poisonous gas upon the trench, you're forced to put on a mask that obscures most of your vision, which is already hampered by the billowing yellow cloud. Coupled with the cracks of nearby rifles you're no longer certain are friendly, that feeling of claustrophobia rapidly crumbles away to panic."", ""Suddenly you hear the command to charge and overrun enemy fortifications, and you leap over the edge and into the heart of no man's land. You traverse the war-torn earth by hiding behind hills, trees, or in bombed-out craters. You watch as enemies scramble over hills in a desperate attempt to reach the security of their own trench--most getting cut down before earning that safety. Crouching or lying prone helps you avoid getting taken out by enemy combatants, as you wait for a CPO to call in mortars or gas to soften the hardened enemy defense. You methodically move from one point to the next, taking time to line up your rifle and pick off enemy soldiers who carelessly expose their heads. Without question, the pace is slow and deliberate; Verdun is the antithesis of many modern shooters, yet more exciting than many of its peers for brief periods."", 'But even when the game is at its finest, you must still grapple with some problems. There is frequent lag, causing enemy soldiers to abandon their running animations to teleport across the field. Worse, however, are the times when your gun appears to fire through an enemy without doing any damage. This scenario happens all too often: You line up your shot, fire, and... nothing happens. You line up again, more carefully this time, fire... nothing. I have lost fights at point-blank range due to this ""phantom bullet"" occurrence. It seems impossible to finish more than two games without it happening, and when you drop into a twenty-second respawn after being killed by someone you know you couldn\'t have missed, it becomes infuriating. There are also issues with the matchmaking. Team balancing is constantly at odds, and the game provides no quick solutions other than to ask if a person or two would ""please"" switch sides. Steep holes and trenches can stop you in your tracks, and for some reason, barbed wire can kill you, holding you in place and then killing you if you don\'t move.', 'Verdun is powered by the Unity engine, and, despite some pop-in with details at a distance, it sports some decent visuals. However, those looks are paired with low performance. Fiddling with the graphics options helps, but it never completely solves the issue. Motion blur can be turned off and anti-aliasing lowered, but your machine may still struggle to reach a smooth sixty frames. And it must be said: Losing color from your vision every time you take damage is a feature of too many shooters these days. For a game like Verdun that strives for a certain authenticity, this is a distracting element that it could have done without.', ""Developers M2H and Blackmill Games deserve kudos for introducing a shooter in this typically untouched wartime era. I admit that, complaints aside, I found Verdun growing on me. I became immersed in its careful pacing and focus on squad movement. But though I put about twenty hours into the game, I don't ache to return to its trenches. Verdun somewhat succeeds in its lavish goal, but its road to glory is lengthy still. Until then, it sits on the edge of the line, waiting for the rallying cry.""]"Justin Haywald,7-May-15,BOXBOY! Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/boxboy-review/1900-6416125/,8,3DS,"[""BoxBoy! is a game that subverts your expectations. The game looks like it belongs on the original Game Boy, but even there it wouldn't seem visually inspired, and the initial puzzles are almost off-puttingly simplistic. However, this black and white platforming game about an anthropomorphic box offers up new challenges in such rapid succession that you quickly progress from smirking condescension over its simplicity to satisfying consternation caused by its more elaborate creations."", ""The puzzles, particularly in the beginning, can be finished in less than a minute, but this actually works in the game's favor. Like Tetris or any number of other puzzle games, after you finish one round, it always feels like you have time for just one more. That brevity is especially well-suited to a handheld platform like the 3DS, where you have time to solve a few levels while sitting on the bus, or in between TV commercial breaks."", 'Your goal in each stage is to navigate from point A to point B, generally through narrow, obstacle-filled passages. You run and jump over spikes and pits just like in any other platformer, but what makes your character special is his ability to spawn boxes. The number of simultaneous connected boxes you can create at one time varies with each stage, though you always control how many you want to create at a time. And when you make a new set of boxes, the previous ones disappear. Create one and toss it around for a quick step up, or turn three into an impromptu set of stairs that you push to bridge a hazardous gap. Unlike you, these boxes are not sentient and their only purpose is to help you get around. Instead of neatly detaching yourself from your box bundle, you can also choose to keep it attached and use it like an additional limb. In that role, it can be used to press buttons, lift you out over chasms, or transport you through tight spaces using your ability to reabsorb the squares like grappling hook.', ""You die often while trying to find the correct box placement to safely traverse a level, but checkpoints are so frequent that it almost feels like there's no punishment for failing. Instead, you're able to plot out a course using focused trial and error without having to repeat puzzles you already know how to do flawlessly. While the game keeps throwing new deadly impediments in your way, you eventually get to the point where you can tell at a glance what blocky shapes you need to chain together to survive. That's when the challenge becomes not just getting to the end, but collecting all of the crowns."", 'Early on, you run into these optional collectibles as part of making your way normally through each stage; in later levels, the crowns are purposefully placed in a way that requires careful box management. The solution to solving some of the more devious level layouts would only come to me after putting the game away for several hours and coming back with a fresh mind. Suddenly, the answer would stand out as ridiculously obvious, but I not only felt like a genius for figuring out combinations of moving, extending, and retracting boxes, but I also learned valuable lessons for overcoming later stages.', ""Your basic abilities never change, although you're eventually able to summon more than one set of blocks, and the unlockable costumes you earn by collecting crowns and beating levels are almost purely cosmetic, outside of a lone, late-game bunny costume. But that simplicity is what keeps the game exciting and the puzzles fresh. There are no obstacles that you need to come back to after you unlock a new ability or upgrade; from the moment you start the game, you have everything you need to solve every puzzle: your wits."", 'BoxBoy! may not make the best first impression, but through the course of my adventure, I began embuing the cute, blocky protagonist with his own personality. To me, he is strong-willed hero willing to brave adversity and overcome any obstacle. He just happens to also be a two-tone square. But going deeper than its simple exterior reveals a game filled with ingenious puzzles and a clever, box-manipulating mechanic. It does what a good puzzle game is supposed to: serve up a challenge and make you feel smarter for figuring out the solution, which was right in front of you all along. When I started BoxBoy!, I thought it would be a game for kids. In the end, it felt like a game especially made for me.', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ']"Josiah Renaudin,6-May-15,Remnants Of Isolation Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/remnants-of-isolation-review/1900-6416127/,5,PC,"[""If you chip away at Remnants of Isolation's outer shell--its piano-heavy soundtrack, turn-based combat, and vibrant color palette--you're left with a lifeless love story. This dyadic core leaks into each subsequent layer, from the party system that never expands beyond a twosome to the title screen overpowered by two tightly clutched hands superimposed over a gang of silhouetted fiends unmoved by the romance. The narrative drives the experience, but the ride is neither touching nor inspiring. The bond between hero and heroine is hampered by the female character's lack of a voice, and the inconsistent writing makes it difficult to care when the male lead fumbles his way through conversations. The surrounding elements have their charm, but Remnants of Isolation falls far short of making a believable or memorable emotional connection."", ""The stage is set with a scene of isolation. Stowed away in a castle is a lilac-skinned girl with eyes of mismatched colors, absent a voice but masterful with an acoustic instrument that she can summon from thin air. She's alone and seems to have been that way for some time, but that changes once she's mysteriously freed from her prison and runs into a brash, out-of-sorts mage, quick to make friends. Unfortunately, the girl cannot speak to the nature of the castle (or speak at all, for that matter), so the couple must explore its many corridors to discover their purpose for being there and, more importantly, how to escape."", ""Learning both characters' connections to the castle can be interesting, but Remnants of Isolation runs just shy of three hours. That gives these two strangers a remarkably short window to get to know each other, let alone foster any sort of tender relationship. Additionally--and I'll continue to press this issue--the female lead is mute. Maybe it's her prolonged confinement that's kept her silent, but robbing such a substantial character of opinions, personality, and any opportunity to connect with the player at a deeper level is a missed opportunity. The text boxes are dominated by the hero, Melchior, who alternates between exposition-heavy blurbs and uncomfortable romantic gestures that he often retracts in embarrassment. The scattered notes that provide context for your environment tend to be well-written and mostly interesting, but the dialogue leads to more eyes rolled than hearts warmed."", 'The link that the duo shares during battle is much more substantive. Along with a standard physical attack, each character can launch either an ""innate"" ability or a spell. Using your fire, ice, or lightning magic on its own doles out significant damage, but leading with one character\'s innate ability and following with the other\'s spell produces a combination attack that might do double damage, hit multiple targets, or cause myriad status effects. As you gain levels and acquire new abilities, your arsenal of offensive and defensive maneuvers expands, and you often need to experiment mid-battle to come up with combos that hit the hardest.', ""For a two-character, turn-based system, there's plenty of strategy here. Both players start each battle with just three MP--gaining two additional points per turn--so it's critical to balance your attacks and not lean too heavily on a single spell or character, lest you run your MP dry. The enemies you run into don't go down easy, either, and the creatures you encounter don't often respawn after being defeated. Grinding out levels and currency isn't a viable option, so Remnants of Isolation trusts you to fight the fights presented and choose well-timed techniques over brute force."", ""Creating new gear and optimizing your characters is rewarding, but the game's linearity and brief runtime don't allow for much variability in how you outfit your party. You earn souls from each battle, and this currency is used to create weapons, armor, and items. If there were a deeper weapons cache--multiple status effects tied to specific items or armor that heavily favored magic defense over physical defense--this system might be more interesting. There's an optimal permutation for each character, and as long as you engage in most battles and smartly spend your souls, you'll easily maximize your gear before the final encounter."", ""The most emotionally resonant aspect of Remnants of Isolation might just be its sound design. The sweet, soft soundtrack is expertly accented by the satisfying pings and hums associated with even the most ordinary actions. Opening chests and surfing through menus just sounds good, but the visual counterpart does little to complement the sound. Remnants of Isolation was crafted in RPG Maker, so its familiar assets and a run-of-the-mill fantasy aesthetic make for an uneven visual package, and being forced to play in windowed mode doesn't exactly benefit the experience, either."", ""It just doesn't strike as many chords or hit as many notes as it should. Remnants of Isolation is a truncated RPG that never allows its story or progression system to properly develop, and while the focus on a pair instead of a full party pays off in combat, the woefully undercooked bond between the protagonists never does enough to make you care about any of the three possible endings. It can be sweet, but Remnants of Isolation has far too many potholes to be worth its notably short ride."", ' ', ' ']"Heidi Kemps,6-May-15,Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor 2 Record Breaker Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/shin-megami-tensei-devil-survivor-2-record-breaker/1900-6416126/,8,3DS,"['Some of the best games for each console come out just as the systems are on their deathbed, cursed to be overlooked as people abandon the old to embrace new systems. Such was the case with Devil Survivor 2, a wonderful Nintendo DS strategic role-playing game that released in early 2012, just in time for shiny new 3DS offerings to overshadow its release. Its taken its sweet time, but Devil Survivor 2 has now come to 3DS with a host of enhancements in tow. And by enhancements, I mean a lot more than just some 3D retroactively applied to an old game--Devil Survivor 2 Record Breaker is essentially two games in a single package, both of which are terrific games in their own right.', 'The Devil Survivor games are strategy RPGs with a twist. Like many games of this sort, you move characters around a grid-based map, carefully utilizing turns and positioning to gain a tactical advantage over your foes. However, Devil Survivor adds another layer to this. Instead of just controlling a squad of individual units, each unit represents a team of three characters. When combat is initiated, the view switches to a battle screen where you choose commands for all of your characters. By cleverly exploiting enemy weaknesses and targeting vital parts of teams, you can earn extra combat turns to perform additional actions. But the enemies can also do the same to you, which can be devastating when you encounter hordes of fiercer foes.', 'Careful decision-making is a must at all times. Do you target the weaknesses of the flanking troops to get extra turns or go for the tougher leader to take down the whole squad at once? Will attacking an easy mark put you in range of something more dangerous? Should you substitute in weaker demon companions to earn bonuses like added range and movement? Theres a tremendous amount of depth to the combat, and its put to the test in some of the best boss fights of the genre. In these battles, youre faced with terrifying, all-powerful beings who possess attacks that can absolutely decimate you--fierce long-range fire cannons, repeated multi-hitting strikes, multiple parts that regenerate after a set amount of turns--and you truly have to use your wits to figure out just how to take them down. Fortunately, you can use an infinite number of free battles to strengthen your team, along with access to an auction site for demon contracts and a function to fuse demons into even stronger forms. You need to make heavy use of these to succeed.', 'The game is split into two scenarios: the Septentriones and the Triangulum. You choose the scenario you want when you start the game. The Septentriones scenario is essentially the entire original game, tasking you and your friends in Tokyo with surviving and quelling a world-rending disaster with the aid of a mysterious demon-summoning phone app. The Triangulum scenario picks up after the end of the Septentriones story, restarting the cycle of destruction, despair, and chaos with a new set of cosmic invaders in a world thats been transformed in some very significant ways. What is the meaning of the almighty beings and the all-consuming forces attacking mankind? Can the seemingly endless cycle of destruction ever be halted? You must answer those questions during these two quests.', 'Because the original game is more than three years old at this point, youll probably want to jump into the Septentriones scenario first if you havent played it for a while--or at all. Veterans will immediately see some significant changes here. The first is the difficulty selection, which offers you both easy (Blessed) and hard (Apocalypse) settings. (The original game only had a single difficulty setting, which roughly corresponds with Record Breakers Apocalypse setting.) You can switch difficulty levels on the fly, which is a nice touch--this allows you to do things like grind easy optional battles to build up your demon armys skills while saving the big challenges for the crucial story fights. The other major addition is full voice-over for nearly every line in the game thats not spoken by the lead (whose words you always control via a menu during conversations). Devil Survivor 2 may have the most voicework Ive yet heard in a 3DS game, and its very impressive, with some standout performances for characters like the heros awkward, uneasy BFF Daichi and egalitarian organizer Ronaldo.', 'The Septentriones scenario itself is lengthy, taking around 50 hours to complete--and that doesnt take into account the four different endings you can acquire by making different choices and taking sides with certain characters. Its familiar territory if youve played Devil Survivor before, but the big draw in Record Breaker--the Triangulum scenario--is not just a tacked-on afterstory. Taking place after the true ending of Devil Survivor 2, its both a direct follow-up and an alternate universe story to the Septentriones plotline (given what happens at the end of that particular scenario). The cast of heroes reunites to face an all-new threat in a world that is both the same and very different: characters have different backgrounds, someone very important is missing, and a strange new person has taken their place. On top of that, your companions have recurring nightmares about pasts they dont quite remember and visions of strange things happening to the heros body. While its not quite as long as the original quest, its still quite lengthy--I clocked in at about 35 hours on my Triangulum playthrough. Much like the Septentriones quest, there are also three possible endings, so youll be playing for a while if you want to see everything.', 'Theres a tremendous amount of depth to the combat, and its put to the test in some of the best boss fights of the genre.', 'The addition of the Triangulum story elevates Record Breaker from the rest of the intergeneration re-releases that have become popular in the market as of late. While most games are content to offer just an HD (or, in this case, a 3D) upscale, the developers of Record Breaker created whats essentially an entire second game for this package. While thats impressive and commendable, its brought down a bit by the fact that theres not really much new in terms of gameplay in the second half--youre controlling (mostly) the same cast with the same traits, fusing similar demons to what you had before, and fighting similar enemies. There are a few new bosses, which offer some exceptionally challenging and satisfying fights, but for the most part, its just more Devil Survivor 2. Thats not a terrible thing, given that the core game is so solid, but its still a smidge disappointing given just how much went into creating a whole new story for the game.', 'The other major issue is that the requirements for getting the true endings are too obtuse in both scenarios. While a few very clear paths lead to obvious conclusions, just getting the option to see the best endings requires you to make a lot of correct choices and talk to the right people at the right times. If you mess up just once, sorry buddy, better luck next time. The presence of only five save slots doesnt really help either, especially if you want to run both scenarios. By the time I understood the requirements for getting the true ending in the Triangulum story, every save I had was at a point where it was impossible to go back.', 'When it comes down to it, though, these complaints seem relatively minor. Devil Survivor 2, in both the original and Record Breaker incarnations, is a great strategy RPG, delivering a potent mix of intense, brilliantly designed combat and a fantastic, endearing cast of fellow survivors. If you missed out the first time around, you should absolutely hop on board for this extended trip to the Apocalypse. If youre coming back for seconds, youll have a terrific time welcoming our new Triangulum overlords with Megido blasts right to their stupid geometric faces.']"Justin Clark,4-May-15,JumpJet Rex Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/jumpjet-rex-review/1900-6416124/,5,PC,"[""If you were born after the NES was in its heyday, the sparkly throwbacks now being released every couple of weeks might give you the impression that the era was just all killer, no filler for 10 beautiful years. In this dream world, Super Mario Bros. 3 was the only game anyone ever needed, a new Mega Man rained down upon us from the heavens on a regular basis, and Capcom and Konami were revered as gods and their every offering was like delicious, life-sustaining manna. In that regard, JumpJet Rex is a blessing, in that it reminds us that the 8-bit era wasn't all sunshine, lollipops, and rainbows. It was also a lot of screaming, nerve-destroying, controller-chucking aggravation, and none were immune from its sudden onset. Ask anyone who bought the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game, expecting a fun, breezy time for the whole family, and watch the thousand-yard stare wash over them like the evening tide."", ""JumpJet Rex brings back that delightful concept of a cutesy setup being used as a vessel for diabolical evil. In it, the dinosaurs were advanced enough to master space travel, sending up a lone, rocket boot-wearing T-rex to go explore the galaxy. While he's up there, mission control finds out that an asteroid--the asteroid--is on its way, and sends Rex to the outer reaches to go destroy it. Oh, and to explore a couple dozen random planetoids along the way."", ' ', ""The planets are perfect tile-based approximations of 8-bit pixels, albeit with huge, widescreen playing fields. The environments, sadly, are limited, recycling the same four space base/ice level/plant world/stone temples throughout. Though the enemies get annoyingly diverse later--more on that soon--the levels lose their luster by the end. They are, undoubtedly, on the appealingly colorful side; the ice levels beautifully depict Hoth-like conditions in which to zoom around, and a lightning effect on the later space stages make them look particularly animated and dangerous. The accompanying chiptune soundtrack doesn't take full advantage of the NES's jerry-rigged range of instrumentation, but it's fun, catchy stuff to putter around the galaxy to."", 'Movement is pleasantly free-flowing. Having rocket boots means that you have an infinite jump, the ability to blast yourself left and right, and lift off vertically, and a tiny blast is given off in your wake that can actually do damage to enemies. Using these abilities, your mission in each stage is to pass through a specified number of gates to open up the finish line, where you earn a star. Like in Super Mario 64, you need a certain number of stars to open up each stage, but you can earn additional stars per stage by getting through without dying and by beating the stage time record.', 'Sounds easy. It is decidedly not.', ""Early stages are a delight, with Rex blasting through coins, squeezing through tight corridors, and making split-second maneuvers to dodge lasers or avoid the walls. You're dead in one hit, so that old tension is here, keeping your reflexes sharp; It's challenging, but fun all the same. After the first boss, however, the difficulty spikes hard and fast. The game gets projectile-happy in a hurry, where tracking lasers and fire-spewing plants line every surface or are set up just past the outer limits of the screen where you can't see them, seemingly just begging you to try using your rockets. Tight squeezes are now less a matter of having a few tiles to move around but a scant few pixels. Boss fights aren't necessarily hard but tedious, with every hit doing minor chip damage at best. Around halfway through, the game ceases to be fun. It becomes a chore. Difficulty isn't a negative in and of itself, but its merits can be measured in a simple question: Is it my fault I'm dying? Is there a flaw in my own skills that could prevent this?"", ""Increasingly, the game sits on the bad side of that question, where obstacles are surmountable seemingly by sheer luck more than skill. The game puts import on being able to nab more than one star from a stage to advance, but the time trial records are ludicrous, and dying becomes more and more a certainty; it is a recipe for seething hate. Your rewards for success often come down to little more than the money you've collected, which can be traded for insanely overpriced cosmetic items. In one of the stores you open early on, every item costs $100,000 coins. By the time I reached the final boss, I had $78,000. Troublesome economy aside, technical hitches are common, even on fairly straightforward stages and bosses, with the frame rate tanking and button presses ceasing to register when things get too busy."", ""Just like the most aggravating NES games, it's frustrating because there's fun to be had, and had often, in JumpJet Rex. It feels great to play, the aerial trickery is gratifying, and it's got a lot of goofy charm, but all of this is unfortunately buried under an inexplicable need to test players beyond what should be necessary in a galaxy where you tool around as a T-rex wearing sunglasses.""]"Brett Todd,29-Apr-15,The Weaponographist Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-weaponographist-review/1900-6416122/,7,PC,"[""Some games are just likable. Take The Weaponographist, for instance. This top-down dungeon crawler doesn't do anything in an obviously outstanding way. At a glance, you've got a standard, forgettable, dumb Gauntlet clone: nothing more, and nothing less. But the game's speedy pace, stiff challenges, wide variety of monsters and weapons, weapon and skill gimmicks, and loads of old-school cartoon charm hook you. I started off the game yawning. I wrapped things up many hours later with aching wrists (you absolutely need a gamepad here, so don't even bother trying the keyboard option) and a smile on my face."", ""A big part of the game's appeal is its refusal to take anything seriously. In the solo campaign (there are no multiplayer options other than the ability to check your timed scores online against other players), you play Doug McGrave, a demon-slaying stud in shining armor. As he's wandering around the countryside in the opening cutscene looking for new challenges and new sources of filthy lucre, he encounters a witch who pleads for help stamping out a demon infestation. She's broke, though, so Dougie isn't interested--at least, not until she whips out a vitality- and weapon-withering curse that soon convinces him that he should try slaying evildoers for charity."", ""All of this is played as a send-up of the traditional role-playing epic, with Doug looking like a cartoon superhero right down to his big, bumper-like chin. The visuals have been taken straight from an old-time cartoon. Both the cutscenes and the in-game graphics come off like lost clips from the Hanna-Barbera shows that aired on Saturday mornings in the 70s. The audio is just a shade smoother than the bleeps and bloops of the 16-bit era, giving the game even more retro allure. Visuals and sound combine to set a light, carefree mood that adds a lot to the overall experience of exploring underground dungeons and murdering all the inhabitants. The writers don't try too hard, either, so you don't have to deal with groan-worthy puns or the obnoxious, unfunny joking too common in games."", ""Gameplay isn't quite as enjoyable as the setting and story, but it's close. The Weaponographist sticks to the traditional hack-and-slash RPG formula. Doug ventures into multiple dungeon levels (called depths), each loaded with numerous close-quarter rooms that serve as battle arenas. A couple of save points can be found in each depth, letting you save progress midway through and then again before the concluding boss battle. Rooms generally work as follows: You walk in, the door closes, you don't get out until you kill dozens of creeps."", ""A big part of the game's appeal is its refusal to take anything seriously."", ""Monsters are played for laughs, as with the overall cartoonish visuals. The wide-ranging rogues gallery consists of demons in all manner of weird forms. There are lions with whips dressed as circus lion trainers, leprechauns with deadly yo-yos, dark elf archers, Ents with slingshots, and more. Each depth features a handful of new creatures with new weapons. All the weapons can be picked up and used against the bad guys, which livens things up as you proceed deeper and deeper into the underground labyrinth of evil. It's all more than a bit surreal, but the creatures are too broadly drawn and colorful to be outright creepy. Art direction that was slightly more adult would have made this a disturbing, nightmarish experience."", ""As noted above, the witch's curse decreased the durability of Doug's weapons and his skills as a warrior. So every sword, whip, machine gun, spear, and so forth comes with a lifespan that ticks down on a meter on the lower left side of the screen. When your weapon crumbles, you're stuck duking it out with your armored fists, making it imperative to scrounge something else as soon as possible. Magic weapons can be equipped to launch powerhouse attacks. Rings of fire can be summoned up with the magic staves left behind by slain wizards, for example, and the tubas dropped by marching-band goons can be used to fire Death Star-like laser blasts."", ' ', ""Speed is of the essence as well. Doug's curse makes him get weaker whenever he isn't killing monsters, with his strength shown on a combo bar. Slack off on the murderousness, and the bar quickly starts to empty. When it completely runs out, Doug starts losing experience. So it is imperative to get on and stay on a roll where you are constantly killing foes. Do this, and Doug gets into a rhythm where he is regularly leveling up and staying just ahead of the increasingly tougher mobs of bad guys that stock each new dungeon chamber. Fall behind on the slaying, and everything quickly gets tougher and tougher, with the end result being that you become overwhelmed by the sheer number of enemies."", ""Both elements have a big effect on combat, turning it into a fitting blend of speed and strategy. Constantly running and killing is key to everything, although you must also be careful about what weapon you pick up. Some just don't work very well against certain foes, and others are wildly underpowered or a poor fit when dealing with numbers of enemies. The chainsaw, for instance, is practically worthless in swarms of monsters due to how slowly you maneuver it. On the other hand, weapons like the zippy whip are almost too powerful given how fast you can deal out damage while racing around."", ""A bit of luck is involved here, too, because you can get stuck in some rooms without a good weapon for so long that you might as well just lie down and die. Enemy buffs that speed up monsters or cause balls of death-dealing slime to bounce around rooms can also pop up, making life even tougher. A combination of these apparently random special effects and crap weapons can end Doug's dungeon delving in a hurry, even if you keep up your combo meter."", ""When your weapon crumbles, you're stuck duking it out with your armored fists."", 'The action gets repetitive, however. Combat involves doing the same thing over and over again while slightly adjusting your approach to deal with different types of enemies. Depths are tough in the early going, meaning that you have to replay rooms on a regular basis. I found that I had to die a number of times in the first rooms of each depth to trigger a respawn back in the village hub, where I could spend the demon goo acquired from vanquished foes on buffs for weapons, magic gear, and so forth. I had to build Doug up in this way in pretty much every depth, having to die on at least three or four occasions before I was tough enough to start overwhelming the opposition. Be prepared for a fair amount of grinding.', 'Despite its reliance on a familiar formula and some repetition, The Weaponographist is a dumb, fun arcade romp due to its quick pace and interesting concepts governing weapon use and skills. This is one of those friendly games that just about anyone would enjoy picking up for short play sessions every now and again, especially those who like their dungeon crawlers tinged with a sense of humor and a retro flavor.', ' ']"Cameron Woolsey,28-Apr-15,Ziggurat Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ziggurat-review/1900-6416120/,7,PS4,"[""It's tough being a neophyte wizard in the world of Ziggurat. If spending two decades learning the fundamentals of magic and spellcasting isn't hard enough, you must now put those skills to the test in the infamous, multi-leveled ziggurat, where creatures from myth and fantasy eagerly wait to snuff out your very existence. Ziggurat, a first-person, dungeon-crawling roguelike, won't overwhelm you with its brief length. But as short as your victory run may be, the brisk combat flow and compelling sense of progression will keep you transfixed despite some minor problems."", 'You will face many challenges as you leap and sprint through the labyrinthine ziggurat. It features procedural level design, which means you get a different adventure every time you play. Like The Binding of Isaac, levels are constructed of a series of linked rooms, and the doors slam shut in the presence of dark minions, sealing you in with your prey...or your hunters. Lurking in the dark passageways you find the usual smattering of fantasy archetypes, such as necromancers, sword-wielding skeletons, and impish goblins--along with some exceptions, such as evil mushrooms and crab-clawed demons. Oh, and killer carrots. Yes, carrots, which are almost too adorable to put back into the ground--but what else are you to do against vegetables that turn evil?', 'Some rooms contain traps you must overcome, or modifiers that change how you approach a fight. The latter can include increasing enemy size or quadrupling damage given and received; you can also get something more aesthetic, such as the always-amusing big pixel mode, which gives the game the look of a mid-90s shooter.', ""Every quest into the ziggurat's recesses has a humble beginning. At first, you are armed with only a simple wand and a slowly regenerating mana pool. But your arsenal steadily increases to include three other magical tools and powers, including spells of ice and poison and staffs that rapidly fire glowing bolts of energy. Weapons and spells are scattered throughout the ziggurat's many rooms and floors, either floating in the air or stored in chests, just waiting to get plucked and added to your hotbar. Each come equipped with an alternate attack that changes their attack speed or potency at a higher cost to your mana pool, which is replenished by picking up colored gems that fallen enemies occasionally drop. It won't be long until you find your favorite tools of the mystical trade. The magma rifle, with its incredible range and powerful explosive slug, is always a top choice. But the one I will always make a mad dash for is the scarab beetle staff, which fires red bugs that ricochet off surfaces. The staff works wonders at medium range, but in smaller rooms, those carrots dont stand a chance!"", ""Ziggurat is a fight for survival against some nasty foes, but the longer you persevere, the more chances you have at increasing your odds of survival. Gathering knowledge gems that are periodically dropped by your fallen enemies allows you to level up and choose one of several random perks, which come in the form of magical cards. Perks can also be acquired in secret rooms, their hiding places betrayed by cracks in the wall. An element of strategy is involved in picking the right perk, and your decision can have a huge effect on how long you last against the oppressive odds--in Ziggurat, you will find that long-term planning can lead to handsome rewards. Favoring the perk that instantly replenishes any lost health seems like a no-brainer. But you have a choice between said card and Bookworm, which allows you to choose among three cards on the next level instead of the default two, how would you proceed? You can also gamble with your fate in rooms where shrines to ancient deities rest. Sacrificing health or mana give you a chance to earn a divine favor if you're fortuitous or a penalty if youre not. If you stumble upon the Oracle perk, which removes all divine punishments, fortune will smile upon you."", ' ', ""Movement and combat flow at a rapid pace, reminiscent of classic shooters of yore. There is no stamina to speak of, so sprinting from room to room goes unabated. It's actually quite common to fly through an entire floor in under 10 minutes. You're not slowed down by pools of water, and you can fall from precarious heights without taking any damage. You can adjust your position in the air as well, which is necessary for some of the challenge rooms. These rooms award you with a new perk, spell, or weapon after you dodge flying darts or nimbly hop across rocks and floating debris in stretching pools of lava. This degree of energetic locomotion keeps your heart pounding as you explore the ziggurat, often running backwards, Serious-Sam style, from approaching clutches of hungry foes, picking them off with shotgun blasts of arcane ice or blowing them apart with chemical bombs. Ziggurat's sweat-inducing velocity, combined with the satisfying feeling of growth brought about by its perks system, is, well, spellbinding, and it had me returning to its musty halls even late into the night."", ""But some issues will pull you out of the enchantment. There are graphical glitches and performance issues, such as frame rate drops and flickering shadows. In its defense, however, Ziggurat looks fantastic. The game dazzles with a charming, almost Fable-like quality, with sources of light emanating from burning torches or esoteric crystals sprouting from the floor to cast bright hues of purple, yellow, and green against grungy stone walls and floors. So it's a shame that on rare occasions, black smears damage Ziggurat's attractiveness. These smudges flicker as you look around, and they can be thin and amorphous, stretching across the screen. The worst smear I encountered covered a good third of the upper portion of my view. And let me tell you, when you have hulking foes to fight and projectiles to dodge, missing such a huge chunk of the screen is unacceptable. The blotches, oddly, only exist in a single room at random, and they seem to be triggered by minions. I couldn't make any sense of this phenomenon, which haunted several of my playthroughs."", ' ', ""Beyond that, I just can't seem to find any love toward Ziggurat's bosses, who guard the portal you use to ascend to the next floor. Some of the bosses are merely larger versions of existing enemies, but none of them, except the final boss, offer much of a fight. Most go down after a minute or two of circle strafing, while you only have to dodge the occasional flying projectile."", ""Ziggurat can be completed in just over an hour, but it's unlikely you will stop there. The game is challenging, engaging, and a whole lot of fun, despite its problems. There is an abundance of perks to discover and up to 11 characters to unlock, all of whom have a unique set of strengths and weaknesses. If you believe you have the mystical skills to conquer the mighty Ziggurat, now is your chance to prove your worth.""]"Don Saas,28-Apr-15,Geometry Wars 3: Dimensions Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/geometry-wars-3-dimensions-evolved-review/1900-6416121/,8,Xbox One & PS4,"[""Geometry Wars 3: Dimensions Evolved, the free update to last fall's Geometry Wars 3: Dimensions, is a tale of two radically different tapes. On the first tape, you have a twin-stick shooting level design and potentially supernatural reflexes pushed to their limits in beautiful, technicolor harmony. On the other tape rests some of the most punishing, unfairly designed boss fights this side of a SNES side-scroller. That Geometry Wars 3 remains a great game despite boss fights that transformed me into an apoplectic, rage-fueled, profanity-spewing monster is a testament to just how much Lucid Games has perfected its score-chasing, polyhedral exploding craft."", 'Let\'s talk about the first tape. The first time I saw the score required to pass ""Super Sequence,"" the penultimate level of Geometry Wars 3\'s new Hardcore Mode, I let out a weak laugh. 20 million points ... I consider myself to be an above-average Geometry Wars player, but 20-million-point runs tend to be reserved for my best Pacifism performances. My laugh was premature. It should have been reserved for the level itself. Countless swarms of purple pinwheels, yellow flowers, pink twin cuboids, magnetic blue octahedrons, and yellow rockets filled my screen in a flash of color that would make the opening credits of Enter the Void blush. And I died. I died very quickly.', 'But, as Geometry Wars has always shown, there is a pattern to this madness. The pattern involves dozens of enemies coming to life at once and forcing you to channel your inner ""Luke Skywalker on the Death Star run"" persona while playing more aggressively and dangerously than you ever have before. Geometry Wars gave me the tools to survive, though, and after far fewer attempts than I would have ever guessed, I breezed to 50 million points, which was still 100 million points shy of a two-star score (and 250 million points shy of a three-star run). Surviving pushed me to my very limits in a way that few games ever have, but I felt satisfied that I had earned my victory.', 'Let\'s move on to the second tape: ""Aventurine."" Oh, ""Aventurine."" I will remember your name for the next 10 years. One of the most maligned elements of Geometry Wars 3\'s original release last year was its boss fights. Dimensions Evolved only makes it worse. ""Aventurine"" is the second boss fight (of four) in the game\'s ""Ultimate"" campaign, which adds 40 new levels to the Adventure Mode. I\'m ranked in the top 50 in the world right now on that level with a score I obtained without ever even beating the boss. Similarly, I\'m ranked 27th in the world for a run on the final and only boss on Hardcore Mode, and I still haven\'t beaten it. I suspect I never will.', 'It took me multiple hours to conquer any given boss in Geometry Wars 3\'s Ultimate Mode, but ""Aventurine"" was my own personal Rubicon. I spent over four hours with the spawn location and attack patterns of every single damn enemy on that level memorized -- which occurred after about half an hour or so -- sitting straight up and staring at my TV with such intensity that I saw explosions in the back field of my vision any time I looked away. Geometry Wars had burned itself into the essence of my vision. But I couldn\'t beat the son of a ... word that\'s inappropriate for a family-friendly publication. When I finally did persevere -- after escaping from near collisions and deaths by mere pixels -- I didn\'t feel like Rocky toppling Apollo Creed, ecstatic in my triumph and hard work. I felt like a war-torn veteran crawling out of the foxhole after months of nightly bombardments. I never want to fight that boss again. I never want to play any of those boss fights again.', 'I would rather fight Bloodborne\'s Cleric Beast with just my fists and no blood vials than ever touch ""Aventurine"" or Hardcore Mode\'s ""Topaz"" ever again. Yet, despite the most agonizing video game bosses I\'ve ever forced myself to overcome--minus ""Topaz"" because there\'s only so much I\'m willing to let my blood pressure rise for the sake of a video game achievement--Geometry Wars 3 is better than ever before. Dimensions Evolved has all the content of a minor expansion pack at the price of a free update. This is the standard version of the game moving forward, and minus the abysmal boss fights, Geometry Wars 3 is better, more dynamic, and bigger than ever before.', 'Hardcore Mode addresses the second biggest complaint that long-time Geometry Wars devotees had with the base game: unlocking drones. Drones and drone supers marred the inherent purity of Geometry Wars\' scoreboards. Players who spent more time upgrading their drones had an advantage when trying to reach higher scores. Hardcore Mode does away with drones so only you and the phantasmagoric-colored battlefield determine your performance. Many of these levels were designed with drones in mind, however, so the game supplies plenty of super states to help level the playing field in your favor, which you\'ll appreciate when well over a hundred enemies are on the screen at once. With the exception of the last level, ""Topaz,"" the 20 remixed Hardcore levels send a jolt of adrenaline right into the veins of long-time series fans.', 'Ultimate Mode is a larger addition, featuring 40 new levels and a host of new level types and enemies. While the continued presence of drones in Ultimate Mode may displease fans who can\'t abide that gameplay addition, the excellent level design should soothe most other fans concerns. Whether youre on the level that plays out like an old-school, bullet-hell, Ikaruga-style shooter with fatal red walls pushing you ever forward or playing the new ""Scorpion"" mode, which feels like Centipede on steroids, Ultimate Mode constantly pushes the play palette of the series forward while maintaining the breakneck challenge and pace the series is loved for.', ""I put more than a dozen hours into Dimensions Evolved, but I already fear the dozens of hours more that I'm going to dump into Ultimate and Hardcore Modes as I try to best my own scores and those of my friends. The boss fights remain a titanically poor decision for a series focused on lightning-fast, frenetic gameplay, but when the rest of the package has only gotten better and more varied, they're a frustrating but small price to pay.""]"Britton Peele,27-Apr-15,Crypt of the NecroDancer Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/crypt-of-the-necrodancer-review/1900-6416119/,8,PC,"[""You're tapping the arrow keys along with the beat, avoiding one trap and blowing up another with a bomb.

The game is broken up into four ""zones,"" and unless you\'re attempting to get through them all at once, you\'re allowed to start from any zone you\'ve reached with your selected character. Within in the crypt, you can also find diamonds, which are the only item that will stay with you after you die. These can be used to buy a few permanent upgrades for your character (including more starting health) as well as unlock items and equipment (such as new spells, new variations of weapons, etc.) that can then show up in chests and shops the next time you play. These unlocks give a good sense of permanent progression as you play, though you can buy all the items relatively quickly. I purchased all of them long before I was finished playing through the game, making diamonds feel somewhat useless on later runs.', ""That's not to say that there isn't stuff to keep you coming back to Crypt of the NecroDancer after you've discovered all its items, though. There are a bunch of other characters you can unlock and play as, each with unique twists that force you to play in different ways (with one character, for example, you get free items from shops, but picking up money kills you). There are also daily challenges and Steam Workshop support for mods."", 'If you\'re feeling a particular beat, you can also import your own music to play along with, which works well. It doesn\'t change the actual content of the game, just the rhythm at which you play it. ""Barton Hollow"" by The Civil Wars, for instances, is playable but kind of slow, while the DC Talk hit ""Jesus Is Just Alright"" leads to more upbeat and faster exploring. Regardless of your musical tastes, Crypt of the NecroDancer takes a proven but basic recipe and improves it with a seemingly simple twist. It would have been a fine roguelike game without its musical side, but the rhythm mechanic makes it a truly special experience.', ' ', ' ', ' ']"Don Saas,27-Apr-15,Broken Age Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/broken-age-act-2-review/1900-6416099/,6,PC,"[""The first time I visited Meriloft in Broken Age: Act 1, it was a wondrous experience. Why was this pretentious man dressed as a bird, and why was his rotund son dressed like a nest? How did this village stay afloat in the clouds? Was H'rmony Lightbeard as crooked as he appeared? Why didn't C'rol leave her good-for-nothing husband? There were mysteries to explore, puzzles to solve, and recognizably human--despite their surrealist absurdity--characters to acquaint myself with."", ""When you return to Meriloft in Broken Age: Act 2--under circumstances that I don't dare spoil for those who haven't completed Act 1 yet--you see this world through a fresh lens. And while the mystery of cloud shoes and Gus and F'ther are lessened, there's enough of a sense of the unknown and new twists to pull you through. Why are familiar faces from another part of the world here? What will they do when they realize who you are? There are new mysteries and new puzzles, and it's a joy again...at first. But you will return to Meriloft to solve puzzle after puzzle after puzzle, and like every area in Broken Age: Act 2, you start to find yourself a little tired of it."", ""The puzzles that can be completed in your character's self-contained story are almost all more involved than those in the first act."", ""Broken Age: Act 2 is a classic example of being careful what you wish for. When Act 1 was released early last year, the primary complaints against the game were its short length and overly simple puzzles. Act 2 is a clear response to those complaints on Double Fine's part. The game clocks in at over twice the length of Act 1, while the puzzles are often brain benders in the best Monkey Island/Grim Fandango tradition. But in the transition, Broken Age also succumbs to some of the worst obfuscation and backtracking found in classic point-and-click games."", ""It's impossible to discuss Broken Age: Act 2's plot in any depth without spoiling the end of Act 1 because Act 2 picks off seconds after the events in Act 1. Let me simply say that the plights of Vella Tartine--the girl who raged against her role as a village sacrifice--and Shay Volta--the boy who rebelled against the endless comfort and routine of his sheltered spaceship existence--find themselves smashed together. If Act 1 felt like two separate stories fused together only at the last second, Act 2 intertwines the lives and destinies of our heroes into one gorgeously realized world."", 'Broken Age: Act 2 is a classic example of being careful what you wish for.', ""That sense of cohesion extends past the storytelling. Without wanting to rob any players of the delight of working out some of Broken Age's most devious and intricate puzzles, you can no longer play the game by completing each hero/heroine's story and then tackling the other half the game. Clues are embedded in each character's world that feed back to the other's world. If you are banging your head against your monitor trying to figure out where you went wrong and you're convinced you've exhausted every tool the game's given you so far, as I did on multiple occasions, you're simply missing information you need. Play as the other character for a while, and be observant of some subtle (and occasionally maddeningly subtle) environmental clues for the other hero. The absence of this sort of puzzle-solving in Act 1 makes it a jarring transition in Act 2, but, fortunately, if you fail often enough (as I did), the game clues you in on how to proceed."", 'Even the puzzles that can be completed in your character\'s self-contained story are almost all more involved than those in the first act.

I\'ll give you a hint: it involves a snake, sand, and a pitch pipe. For those who grew up on the rubber chicken/pulley nonsense of The Secret of Monkey Island, that sort of outrageous ""connect the dots"" puzzle solving is half the genre\'s appeal.

Meriloft has items you need to solve puzzles in Shellmound, which provides items needed to solve puzzles in the Tomb of the Dead Eye God, which provides items to solve puzzles in Meriloft and the forest, and so on. The game features a handy feature where double-clicking on the edge of a location allows you to travel away from it fast, but that doesn't alleviate the frustration of spending a quarter of the game wandering around aimlessly as you try to figure out who could possibly use the tap Gus was using to juice an orange or how to sneak into a heavily guarded area of the spaceship when the useful shortcuts have been removed."", ""Despite that, Broken Age weaves an enchanting world. The storybook visuals are as impressive as they were last year. Broken Age is the sort of game I would have fallen in love with as a child, even though I would have lacked the mental skills to solve its puzzles. Combining a storybook aesthetic with watercolors that are strangely reminiscent of Diego Rivera, Broken Age is still one of the most gorgeous games of the 2010s. And the game's narrative finally plays on its Lovecraftian sci-fi premise in fun and unexpected ways, even though the ultimate villain proves to be forgettable compared to Act 1's self-aware reveal. The writing is never Psychonauts-good, but, honestly, what game's writing is?"", 'Broken Age pushes your mental faculties to their limit by the end. On multiple occasions, I became terrified that I wouldn\'t be able to solve a puzzle and I\'d have to resign in disgrace.

Tower of Guns is a genre mash-up of bullet hell games, fast-paced first-person shooters, and roguelikes. And while the game isn't without its flaws, it delivers a high-energy rush."", ""The objective of Tower of Guns is to, well, destroy the Tower of Guns. To do so, you navigate randomly generated levels chock-full of cannons, roving robots, and secret caches of cash. Each floor has a handful of rooms you have to blast your way through on your way to the boss. Of course, because you only have one life available for each attempt to defeat the tower's gauntlet, it's sometimes wiser to keep your gun holstered and simply play dodge(cannon)ball instead, though by doing so, you miss out on loot just begging to be grabbed."", 'You begin each run by selecting a gun and a perk. The two guns available at the start aren\'t anything special, but you quickly unlock others; then you can decide what playstyle suits you best. Your gun options are quite diverse; whether you want to fire bouncing sawblades, highly explosive ""unicorn vomit,"" or the FPS-staple rocket launcher, Tower of Guns has you covered. When it comes to perks, you quickly realize there\'s no better option than your initial choice--the Bluegrass perk. Because who doesn\'t want to start with the ability to triple jump?', ""As you progress through the levels, you gain access to additional jumps and faster movement while seeing a marked increase in difficulty. Although the early levels may seem sluggish, the pace ramps up until you've become completely lost in a delicate waltz weaving in and out of the oncoming onslaught. A normal successful playthrough only takes about 30 minutes (assuming you survive), but the endless mode sends you back into the tower time and time again until either your sanity or your body breaks."", ""No attempt on the tower is the same twice, and although many of the levels will appear familiar as you play, there are always new level chunks to discover or a new enemy layout in a familiar landscape to keep repetitiveness from setting in. Even if every run were on identical terrain, for better or worse, each run is further differentiated by the loot that spawns. Some attempts may give you access to weapon modifications or items that make your destructive path easier to achieve. Others may give you more jumps sooner. If you're extremely unlucky, you may just find coins and hearts everywhere, leaving your arsenal a meager sampling of the game's great sandbox."", ' ', ""Although you have only 10 guns to choose from, many more can be found throughout the game. Each gun progresses in power with experience pick-ups. On my best run, I had the option of swapping through six different guns I'd found to lay waste to the turrets impeding my advance. My personal favorite was a trumpet that launched shrapnel, but the game's Experience Cannon, which literally turns any acquired experience into a weapon, was certainly the most unique."", ""The game controls are very fluid and simple to learn. Occasionally, you may encounter hitches when jumping, but that usually only happens if you're trying to add too much finesse to your ledge dancing. If you find it too difficult to leap across a great divide, you can elect to fire your weapon straight down and use the game's physics as a backwards propellant to give yourself more lift. Aiming can be a little difficult to grasp while moving because every shot is a projectile, forcing you to consider travel speed and distance."", ""Each boss fight offers its own challenges. Though most are fairly easy to handle and are just larger versions of the constructs you fight as you progress through a dungeon, some, such as the stationary Pipe Organ or the Tilt-a-Whirlesque Egg Scrambler, offer a unique experience you can't find in the ordinary halls of the citadel. The game even ensures that fights against the same boss aren't identical. The most notable example of this is seen in run-ins with Dr. Turret; the level's layout can change, greatly altering the experience by segregating the different areas in which his weak point may spawn. Once you get enough jumps and jump height, some of the boss fights begin to get repetitive, but that's only a concern during the long grind of Endless mode--even then, it's not a common issue."", 'No attempt on the tower is the same twice.', ""The level design has its ups and downs. Each floor has a number of secret hiding spots where you can discover new items or loot, and you find out at the end of each level what percent of those secret spots you found. Some are extremely well hidden, and I rarely managed to maintain above a 50% discovery rate for the secrets. If you're a perfectionist, the secrets alone will keep you coming back for more. However, you may glitch through a wall that's not designed to hide a secret. Sometimes you're only there for a second before you're shoved back into the bounds of the map; at other times, you may find yourself completely outside the intended boundaries, free to roam where you were not intended to roam. Sometime, you might simply get stuck between a rocket and a hard place. The game is aware of this possibility, and it gives players the option to reset themselves back to the start of the room by holding Y. That doesn't make the potential hiccups any less annoying though. Some of the Ramparts levels are so easy to escape that the game brings up a dialogue window with a somewhat comedic message from the developer letting you know that you escaped the bounds of the map into an area of dodgy collision detection; the game reminds you about the reset function if you venture too far."", ""The game's dialogue is easy to overlook, but it's worth it to stop for a moment and read it. Each storyline is laced with tongue-in-cheek humor and silly characters. One story features you playing as the developer's brother (the composer), and you critique various levels during a conversation with the developer. Although the story has no effect on the game itself, the different stories are all worth reading at least once--you'll get a good smile or a hearty chuckle out of them. Likewise, every loading screen features random punchy comments to further add to the game's comedic entertainment value and to make sure you know that the game doesn't take itself too seriously."", 'The only other issue that can interrupt your enjoyment of Tower of Guns comes when you experience the harsh wake-up call that there is a such thing as too much fun. Whether due to the massive on-screen population of spinbots and bombs, the largest loot pinata explosion in history, or a tsunami of bullets, the game experiences a substantial drop in frames, which can lead to a frustrating, premature death. The only solution to the problem is to spray bullets, pray that you survive, and vacuum up your rewards before moving on to the next potential performance hit.', ""Complaints aside, Tower of Guns delivers an engaging experience that is well suited to short bursts of play in its standard form or long marathons in its ranked endless mode.

He could die with dignity here. But when we arrived at the home, he fled. I chased him in his aimless sprint across the decaying but once vibrant Trumbull Valley--killing hordes of zombies to protect him--until, twenty minutes later, I realized that I'd encountered another of State of Decay's game-breaking bugs, and I had to reload my save and start anew."", ""Whenever I attempt to describe State of Decay to people who have never played the game, I find myself describing the game I want State of Decay to be--and the game that Undead Labs attempted to craft--more than the game that State of Decay actually is.

Set in an unspecified portion of the United States, State of Decay tasks you with ensuring the survival of an ever-growing (or shrinking, depending on your competency of play) community after a zombie apocalypse consumes the world. You gather resources, explore, and fight (but mostly avoid) the undead as you look to stay alive."", ""State of Decay feels like a collection of other games' remnants in part because its various systems are separate and distinct entities that often fail to complement each other in meaningful ways.

Eventually, however, the core gameplay loop starts to feel monotonous and tired, which sets in the second your shelters begin to develop any sense of consistent security and prosperity."", 'One of my procedurally generated heroines joined the group and didn\'t want to get to know or talk to anyone beyond Marcus, who had rescued her from a horde when she\'d gone out on one of her first supply runs.

I'd sent one of my original survivors from the church out to meet with the Wilkersons--a family of gun-running thugs whom I decided to placate rather than confront--but she never made it that far. On her drive to their farmhouse, I noticed a supply drop in a huge corn field and investigated. I should have known better. I'd nearly died opening one earlier in the game. The supply drop was a hotbed of zombie activity, and before I could run back to my truck, a Feral--the most aggravatingly agile and swift type of zombie--grabbed her, and, by the time I had pushed him away, a sea of zombies had her surrounded on all sides. She was ripped into gory halves."", 'State of Decay is always one glitch, bug, or broken feature away from drawing you completely out of its experience.', ""The endgame supports a solid strategy of turtling and building up defenses, meaning that you rarely feel the sting of encroaching starvation or the fear that your ammo supply has run dry.

Every resource you use is gone forever and a choice you won't have again down the road, and State of Decay never lets you forget it. The fear that a beloved and effective melee weapon will suddenly break is always there. If you play well enough to lead your survivors to a degree of comfort and security, you feel that you earned it through judicious planning and execution, although you miss those sweat-inducing early runs in the game where failure and retreat meant that some survivors wouldn't eat that day. It all becomes too routine if you play well enough; Intelligent play is not nearly as interesting as life on the edge of total annihilation."", 'By the endgame, you have enough resources to not have to worry about the supply runs that are the key to success in the early game, beyond finding relatively common construction materials, which remain key throughout the game. You are also provided enough human capital to eliminate most of the challenge of avoiding the great masses of zombies that the game intentionally designed to kill you swiftly if you engage too many at once. ""Influence"" is the game\'s key currency, which you gain for completing missions and runs, and you can use it to ask other members of your community for help--a good design and essential for clearing out packed infestations--as well as to call for backup from survivors in Trumbull Valley who aren\'t part of your group. This is problematic when you can call in three magical SWAT team members for a barely nominal influence fee who can then shotgun-blast all the zombies swarming that hard-to-reach supply drop. The cooldowns on those abilities keep you from spamming them, but if you save them for major missions, they remove every last ounce of challenge from the game.', 'Despite that, the character-generated stories in State of Decay--leaving Spencer\'s Mill for fear of the military only to become close allies with them in a well-planned twist and realizing the final cost of my appeasement of the Wilkersons--are so fascinating and well crafted that the game\'s failures in virtually every other category become all the more agonizing. Year-One Survival Edition has addressed few, if any, of the bugs, glitches, and basic structural flaws at the heart of the base game. Environmental clipping is constant throughout the game. Zombies often wander halfway through walls and doors. Textures don\'t so much pop in as entire structures and characters appear out of nowhere, including one instance where I killed an invisible zombie that was terrorizing my group. The AI of your fellow survivors ranges from ""at least they aren\'t getting themselves killed"" to ""where the hell are they going, and why won\'t they stop?""', ""The character-generated stories are so fascinating and well crafted that the game's failures in virtually every other category become all the more agonizing."", ""It isn't quite right to say that the cars in the game control like boats. At least boats in the water have some degree of mobility and precision. The cars in State of Decay control like boats on land. The game intentionally makes melee combat against more than two or three zombies at once difficult both to sell how vulnerable your character is and to teach you to avoid being swarmed, but combat in any sense in State of Decay also reminds you that your character barely controls better than your vehicles, and it's too easy to get caught in the environment or behind AI characters that don't know how to get out of the way and then find a valuable member of your party killed for good. As for inventory management, I appreciate the notion that there's only so much stuff a person can carry at once, but the lack of an ability to give your squadmates equipment and items, and the menu-heavy nature of organizing your supplies, constantly draws you out of suffocating survivalist atmosphere and reminds you that you're playing a game."", ""Trumbull Valley itself never feels like a place that would actually exist. It comes off as a bizarre hybrid of the American Southwest with its rocky orange protuberances dotting the landscape fused with World of Warcraft's Westfall, with tiny farmsteads and towns propped up with cornfields elsewhere. State of Decay's total lack of aesthetic cohesion is never charming in an ironically intentional sense; instead, it constantly reminds you that you're playing a game that could be so much better."", 'If I found myself describing the game to friends as the game I wanted it to be more than the game it was, it\'s because the ""ideal"" version of State of Decay is intoxicating.

Just something about the sticking to the wall pressed the wrong button. We all have standards, right?', ""But these are the kinds of thoughts that permeate the first chuckle-filled hour or two of playing I Am Bread, that magical period of a game like this, Bossa's own Surgeon Simulator, or Soda Drinker Pro where the joke is fresh and still overshadows the proper game found under the joke. The honeymoon period does eventually fade. And when the laughing stops, the white-knuckled aggravation begins."", ""But before that, there is the joke: the fact that I Am Bread is exactly what is advertised. In every level, you play as a sentient slice of bread who sets out on a Sisyphean quest to cross a room and to become golden brown, delicious toast by any means necessary. You do this by inching yourself across a surface or flipping yourself over and over to cover more distance and climbing the walls by sticking yourself to them. The goal could be a toaster. It could be a broken, burning TV. It could be an iron that somebody carelessly didn't unplug. Anything that provides enough heat to get yourself toasty can potentially finish the level for you. But time is of the essence, edibility is of the essence, and deliciousness is of the essence. No, really, the more jelly you can get on yourself before you cook, the better. But make no mistake: you must become toast."", ""Unlike most games of this ilk, I Am Bread comes more from a nice baseline of competent game design. It's certainly more visually appealing than normal, with a kitschy 1950s homemaker environment with a strong dose of food-affecting grossness to give it a contrast. The score has a bouncy, Ben Folds vibe, and though the tunes themselves are short and repetitive, they help sell the pleasant times."", ""Using a gamepad (and I would highly recommend the gamepad, as a mouse/keyboard is staggering in its uselessness here) and moving around as bread is slow but has a clear logic to it. Just pressing the left stick in a particular direction allows you to inch little by little in the chosen direction. Holding one of the shoulder buttons, each corresponding to a corner of the bread slice, allows you to clutch any surface while you turn the bread off the anchor point you're holding. If a manipulable object is in range, toggling a face button allows you to hold onto it while you do your thing. It's actually easy and logical in context, and it makes the early stages easy to work with."", ""It doesn't take long for an evil spike of a learning curve to present itself, however. By stage three, there are fewer flat surfaces to work with and more hellish climbs up walls, bending the slice around corners, and hoping that the finicky physics engine decides not to screw you over if you land in just the right way where you bounce off your destination. You could end up in a freefall where you think you have a shot at grasping a surface to avoid hitting the dirty floor but don't (dirtiness affects edibility, and inedible bread is dead bread.) If you manage to get into a groove with movement, though, it's possible to cartwheel your slice across virtually anything, and that's around when the slew of bugs start to make their presence known. Many have been reported and supposedly fixed by the game's most recent update. For my part, aside from a few physics issues where a bread slice falls through an object it's supposed to lean on, one big one cropped up more than any other: a camera issue where the point of view will tilt straight up, at random, for no reason at all. When sitting on flat surfaces, it's annoying but acceptable. During a grueling climb, however, in a section that's already taken 10-15 minutes to traverse, it can mean the difference between becoming toast and becoming...er...toast. And messing up a stage where you've already spent a half hour just to get within a breath of a hot place, only for the game's physics to throw you for just enough of a loop to fail and send you back to the start, is an infuriating place to be."", ' ', ""The joke does have a punchline it's building to: an ongoing story of the guy whose apartment you're making a mess of in your toasty quest for enlightenment, who's being diagnosed by a therapist because no one believes that sentient bread is to blame. That ultimate punchline is funny, but the game has the same problem that all these joke titles have in that the effort required to hear the joke through to its conclusion renders said joke inert. The game fares better with its bonuses: a demolition mode in which you play a destructive baguette that can be tossed around to wreck a kitchen, a bagel race, and the ability to play stages in zero gravity, with each slice of bread equipped with tiny boosters. The game fares better with these because they can be accessed, futzed around with for 10-15 minutes, and left alone. And yet, the ability to access them requires beating each stage, which can take anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour each, and that's with no guarantee that you'll be successful."", 'Ultimately, it\'s a game for the same folks who still cackle with glee whenever there is a new Sharknado, or that still watch Snakes on a Plane. The joke is in the premise, in the title, and it won\'t stop winking and snickering with you for hours on end. But all it takes is one moment of clarity, one second-guess ""why was I laughing"" for the whole thing to fall apart. And in this game\'s case, all it has to do is remind you of how irksome it can be and often is to go from being a goofy joke to a serious headache in a flash.']"Daniel Starkey,22-Apr-15,Age of Wonders III Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/age-of-wonders-iii-eternal-lords-review/1900-6416115/,8,PC,"[""I founded my empire in the depths of the earth.

You'd bounce between macro- and micro-management, controlling both the direction and structure of your civilization as well as the outcome of individual battles. However, that two-stage system is hard for any game to pull off well, and it was one of Age of Wonders' weakest points. While tactical bouts had plenty of variety and the available options made matches thrilling and tense, the large-scale planning lacked depth, leading to a lackluster half. Eternal Lords finally brings enough new features to flesh out the game and cover almost all the base game's weaknesses."", ""For starters, two new races (the Frostlings and the Tigrans) are added to the basic Dwarves and Elves. Both have a visual flair and uniqueness all their own. Frostlings, for example, are an offensive race with bonuses for ice magic. They dwell in cold areas and can take advantage of often-barren land to launch raids on more temperate cultures. Tigrans are their natural foil. Based on the mythology of ancient Egyptian culture, they are a quick, desert-dwelling class of felines. They worship the sun and idolize the duality of nature. To wit, Tigrans specialize in necromancy, and they worship the dead as well as the living. This makes Tigrans an ideal pairing for Eternal Lords' new class--the Necromancer."", ""In the base Age of Wonders III game and the first expansion, players chose both the race and class of their young nation's leader. Because a good chunk of the game was modeled after Dungeons and Dragons and similar fantasy settings, the classes were standard fare: rogues, warlocks, and warriors. Necromancers are a bit different. Whereas the others fit into standard heroic archetypes, fiction has always associated the art of controlling the minds and bodies of the dead with evil. Let us not forget that in the original Hobbit novel, Tolkien created a necromancer character who bided his time until he could revive himself as the Dark Lord Sauron."", ""Age of Wonders III's latest expansion bolsters an already exceptional core with more races to play, a better grand-scale strategy, and an excellent morality system."", ""Suffice it to say, it's a strange premise to work into an empire-building strategy game. Even fictional conceptualizations of the undead lend themselves to a different system of goals and values. The dead, for example, don't care where they are or what they're doing. They're nigh unlimited as well because any war is likely to yield more soldiers to bolster your armies. Eternal Lords understands this and makes necromancy and its related magicks whole and distinct."", ""I spent the majority of my time with Eternal Lords leading an undead sect of dwarves below ground. I defended my cities with small bands who could summon up much larger armies from fallen warriors on the battlefield. They were a bit weaker than some other units, but I overwhelmed my enemy with sheer numbers. After a time, I gathered enough power to cast a massive spell that revived recently killed troops from around the world under my control. I had become a demigod, and my abrupt omnipresence spooked other world leaders. In short order, I flooded the surface with my abominations and championed the spread of good and kindness throughout the world. Again, it might sound incongruous, but it does a make a sort of sense when you consider how all of Eternal Lords' pieces fit together."", 'For example, the morality system facilitates a broad variety of play styles and leads to some distinct late-game units based on your alignment. The path of good is tied more to sparing the lives of the innocent and protecting the weak than it is to any cosmic moral authority. As such, I decided that my undead were like friendly vampires. They did what they needed to do, but they were more interested in establishing systems of cooperation with the hope that everyone else would willingly choose to become zombies at some point in the future.', ""To that end, I made friends with the other races, brought them under my protection, and governed them as well as I could. I eventually converted them, but they were almost always better for it. Those choices lead to a positive alignment in the game, and I won by unifying the globe in peace and harmony. You won't see any complex, ambiguous moral quandaries here, but it works as the foundation for a creative system to promote an interesting network of decisions and allegiances."", ""Tendencies towards openness and role-playing even show up in Eternal Lords' single-player campaign. Here, you'll play as Arvik, a necromantic Frostling. He is the heir to his kingdom's throne and is thrust into a complex political situation, forcing him to make a series of tough calls as he unlocks his abilities as a powerful wizard. Each new scenario presents you with important decisions regarding how you want to govern your people and what kind of leader you want to be. It's not the best writing around, but it does reinforce the themes of Eternal Lords' minute-to-minute play--engaging decisions."", ""Eternal Lords carries a few problems over from its core game. Worker units aren't terribly useful, for example, outside of building singular roads. Flying units can move around the battlefield without any kind of penalty, and because those are typically the strongest units (i.e., dragons), it can sometimes feel like you don't have much recourse against stronger opponents. That's balanced somewhat by the sterling tactical play, which rewards careful planning and gutsy gambles, but it still leaves something to be desired."", ' ', 'The morality system facilitates a broad variety of play styles and leads to some distinct late-game units based on your alignment.', 'Strategy game legend and Civilization creator Sid Meier once said, ""Games are a series of interesting decisions."" By that metric, Age of Wonders III: Eternal Lords is excellent. Your possibility space is vast, and you can craft your adventure and your nation in any number of ways. Systems of morality, player races and classes, and governance all work together to create an interlocking web of player-driven narrative potential. This expansion\'s only real weaknesses are those endemic to the structure of the base game, but Eternal Lords is a worthy follow-up and fresh take on the classic turn-based strategy game formula.']"Miguel Concepcion,22-Apr-15,Halo: Spartan Strike Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/halo-spartan-strike-review/1900-6416114/,7,PC,"[""Right from the landmark battle aboard the UNSC Pillar of Autumn, the Halo franchise has almost always been a team effort, even though Master Chief has done most of the heavy lifting in the mainline series. That's where all the spin-offs and novels come in. As the follow-up to Vanguard Games' Halo: Spartan Assault, Halo: Spartan Strike is not only a spin-off, but also a top-down shooter that reinforces the notion that Halo need not be limited to the first-person perspective. From a continuity standpoint, Spartan Strike takes bigger risks than Spartan Assault, setting reprisals from Halo 2 while giving more screen time to the Prometheans, who weren't introduced to the series until Halo 4."", ""Spartan Strike's bite-sized five-minute missions fit in well with a straightforward story involving the Artifact of Doom plot device. In this case, the artifact is called the Conduit, a device that functions as a Promethean portal key. It is also a tried and tested sci-fi term that has been used in Mass Effect, Dead Space, and as the title of a Sega-published first-person shooter. Through much of Spartan Strike, the Conduit is subjected to a football-like change of hands between the UNSC Marine Corps and the Covenant."", ""Equally engaging is the opportunity to revisit familiar areas from the main series. In Halo 2, New Mombasa was a war-torn battleground where Master Chief was just one of countless soldiers tasked to repel the Covenant. The raised visual perspective of Spartan Strike shows off New Mombasa as a highly vertical metropolis. While you're guiding a Spartan-IV along a commercial district in the foreground, UNSC troops are holding their own on a bridge in the background, hundreds of yards away. Although your player-character functions like a one-man army, nothing detracts from the implied accomplishments of the soldiers in the surrounding areas. Conversely, the location shift to Gamma Halo (also known as Installation 03) is a less engrossing environment, as, for the most part, it's a generic jungle accented with Forerunner architecture."", ""The 15 years Halo has been around offers more than enough time for minor timeline errors and potential retconning. It might be inconsistent to see Prometheans in a story arc related to Halo 2, but that doesn't dilute the gratification of making them disintegrate, especially when using their own weapons."", ""Spartan Strike's bite-sized five-minute missions fit in well with a straightforward story involving the Artifact of Doom plot device trope."", ""Much like the Rappys in Phantasy Star Online and the blackbirds in Bloodborne, the Halo Grunts are the series' annoyance incarnate, which makes melee kills with rifle butts all the more satisfying. Even without the first-person view, killing up close in Spartan Strike quenches the bloodlust for these troublesome halflings. As in Spartan Assault, transposing familiar enemies into an overhead-camera perspective works, because of the familiar weapons used to kill them. The battle rifle bridges the lethality of the sniper rifle with the firing rate of the assault rifle, and, as always, makes short work of any elite. The same goes for the mounted gun atop a warthog, which doesn't suffer from overheating."", ""If you've played Spartan Assault (and you should have already, if you're a fan of Halo's expanded universe), the Spartan Strike mission objectives will be very familiar. A given stage will involve one, or a combination, of the following objectives: get from Point A to Point B, destroy X objects, or survive for X seconds. Again, these are short missions, and the simplicity of these assignments works well for Spartan Strike. Holding your ground in a limited space offers a glimpse of how a Fireflight mode would work as a twin stick shooter. Whatever your objectives, it's the abundance of Covenant and Prometheans that serves as the game's connective tissue. The odds seldom feel overwhelming, but there's still a lot of death to go around. Thrilling moments, like vanquishing energy sword-wielding elites, often make high-score incentives a secondary priority. And with all the A.I. marines joining the fight, it's a mystery that Spartan Strike lacks multiplayer, especially when it was one of the big draws of Spartan Assault."", ' ', ""That's not to say Spartan Strike is bereft of features. Customizable loadouts, uncommon in the mainline Halo campaigns, let you pair the assault rifle with a rocket launcher right out the door. Add an armor ability like a regen field, and you have a Spartan who can go toe-to-toe with the Chief. You are fortified well enough that, potentially, you could clear Spartan Strike without dying. This is compounded by the mandatory auto-aim, which cannot be toggled off in the Settings menu. At least you can count on Halo Skulls to give the Covenant and the Prometheans a fighting chance. Whether it's lack of armor or low ammo pick-ups, there's something to increase the stakes. As usual, using Skulls isn't a purely masochistic exercise; reward flirts with risk, since XP is multiplied with Skulls."", ""XP is the juicy core of Spartan Strike's replay incentives. It's the currency for purchasing optional weapons like the Spartan laser or the sniper rifle. These armaments significantly help in fulfilling Assault Ops goals, purely non-mandatory assignments that yield more XP, bragging rights, and progress toward a couple of achievements. And while, typically, achievements are not worth noting, Halo: Spartan Strike's inclusion as an Xbox game for Windows means that achievements can already be earned without having to wait for the unannounced but presumptive Xbox One version."", ' ', ""Much like Spartan Assault before it, Spartan Strike is the closest we have to a Halo game, had it existed in the late 1980s arcades. While the lack of multiplayer is disappointing, it features more than enough loadout options to add variety that it warrants repeat playthroughs. More importantly, Spartan Strike still retains Halo's core combat appeal despite the top-down view, auto-aiming, and amped up armor abilities. It preserves the palpable tension in emptying two M7 Caseless SMGs while back-pedalling against a brute. It's a familiar predicament for Halo fans, but one that can be remedied in Spartan Strike with the one-button ease of an air strike. That might be unfair to the brute, but if you've ever been on the receiving end of a gravity hammer, an air strike is hardly a cheap countermeasure.""]"Leif Johnson,21-Apr-15,Dungeons 2 Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dungeons-2-review/1900-6416113/,6,PC,"[""For all of its chummy quips and hordes of orcs battling My-Little-Pony-esque unicorns, Dungeons 2 comes off as slightly cynical. The first entry tried to revive Dungeon Keeper in 2011 (well ahead of EA's free-to-play debacle last year), and it valiantly attempted to make the franchise its own by giving you direct control of the Keeper and focusing the gameplay on luring heroes in and entertaining them before harvesting their souls. It didn't turn out too well, but developer Realmforge Studios has resolved to give us what it thinks we want. The core dungeon game is almost lifted straight from Dungeon Keeper, the narrator reflects on your actions in a bemused British accent, and dungeon maintenance is paired with an overworld real-time strategy element that closely resembles Warcraft III. Sales figures and reviews have proven that we like these things, yes, but too much gets lost in an ambitious attempt to mash them all together."", 'You wanted Dungeon Keeper, Realmforge seems to say, so here you have it. There\'s little to none of the original Dungeons\' innovations here. Happily, this means that veterans of Peter Molyneux\'s 1997 game will find much that\'s familiar, whether it\'s the throne room and the hole from which you summon minions or the surrounding dungeon that\'s packed with gold veins and potential tunnels just waiting to be dug out. Should one of the ""little snots"" who do your bidding stop to break the fourth wall and wave at the camera, you can slap them around with the giant, disembodied hand you use to guide progress and set minions to new adventures and tasks. Dig out a square or rectangular space and slap down, say, a brewery to attract orcs to hack and slash for you. The production process is slow at times and the AI is responsible for making the little snots work, but this is Dungeon Keeper in all but name.', 'It\'s kept from being a straight clone by a new overworld RTS mode that sends you and your minions off to the world above to mess stuff up and occasionally nab MacGuffins from other, smaller dungeons. The world certainly looks good, and there\'s a pleasing visual element to the whole affair in that the landscape shifts from grassy and sunny to hellish and reddish as your hordes move through it. ""Horde"" is an appropriate word--the game itself calls them that, and it sends you off to fight the forces of the ""Alliance,"" right down to the familiar blue-and-white fortifications from the Warcraft series.', ""Alas, Dungeons 2's RTS element is undercooked. Regardless of which stage of the campaign you're on, the basic strategy never deviates far from amassing a swarm of orcs, goblins, trolls, and snaky naga in the dungeon to attack the Alliance, and you accomplish this most effectively by selecting the whole pile and right-clicking on units to attack. There's some fun involved in watching the world change as you pillage and plunder (even if my GTX 780's performance dragged when too many enemies were on the screen), but the act of guiding your army is complicated by an awkward shift in control schemes from the underground. Deep in your dungeon, you can't control minions directly, which led to some frustration when I realized my little snots were just loitering around because I hadn't dug out a room large enough for my intended project. In the overworld, you can control your units, although singling out the few minions that have special powers involves trying to pinpoint them from the swarm with your mouse and selecting them independently."", ""The chief surprise I encountered while playing Dungeons 2 was that I enjoyed it despite these downsides. I suspect a lot of that has to do with the near-constant humorous narration, voiced by Kevan Brighting. It sounds like he's playing the exact same role that won him such acclaim in The Stanley Parable. Brighting's voice work never fails to hit the proper notes here, even if the script pours on the self-awareness too thick (at one point, your overworld minions encounter and slaughter a bear, and you're told that it was pointless because bear meat isnt used for anything in the game). Sometimes, it feels as though Realmforge is trying too hard, although the narrator's always good when he's used as a tutorial of sorts to correct the Ultimate Evil--as the main character's called--when he goes in the wrong direction."", ""All of this might be much more fun when you take advantage of the LAN and online multiplayer content, which gives up to four players their own dungeons and lets them fight over a shared overworld. Unfortunately, this review arrives prior to the game's full release, so other players are as hard to find as original, sealed copies of Dungeon Keeper from 1997. Its directions are sometimes muddled, and the whole affair feels like it was oversimplified to cut down on micromanagement, but the beauty of Dungeons 2 is that it never fails to let us take some glee in sowing discord. It's not quite a keeper, but it's an improvement over the original."", ' ']"Matt Cabral,21-Apr-15,Harold Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/harold-review/1900-6416058/,7,PS3 & Xbox 360 & PC,"[""Harold is a cleverly crafted, personality-packed infinite-runner platformer with visual style to spare. Its title character, however, is an awkward athlete and a bit of a loser, both literally and figuratively. Despite Harold's unwavering determination and enduring spirit, he does dumb things, like getting stuck in frozen dog pee and high-fiving a cactus. Thankfully, you don't assume the role of this doomed underdog, but of his equally-determined guardian angel Gabe. As this anime Zac Efron lookalike with wings, you help Harold complete a series of increasingly hazardous, side-scrolling races by manipulating environmental objects, messing with competitors, and giving the slow-moving marathoner an occasional speed boost."", 'The monkey wrench in this race is that you have no direct control over the perpetual runner, so clearing and altering his path via divine intervention is the key to ensuring that the lanky, bespectacled competitor finishes in at least third place. Earning the bronze is no simple feat, though, as Harold is an intentionally difficult game, one that ultimately has hardcore completionists and seasoned speed runners in mind.', 'The courses sport the usual platforming elements and obstacles, from moving blocks and slippery surfaces to spiky walls and bottomless pits, but Harold goes beyond the tried-and-true template with some especially inspired touches; Using an ethereal mallet to transform a chomping crocodile into a belly-up bridge and flinging Harold forward with a sling-shotting noose trap never gets old.', ""Interacting with these hazards involves using the left analog stick in a variety of ways: a single level could see you pushing, pulling, flicking, and rotating the stick over the course of just a few seconds. Given how you also cycle through obstacles by squeezing the triggers, Harold puts your nimble fingers through the paces. It feels fantastic when you're in the zone--circumventing traps, swinging on ropes, and hitting the ground running with a speed boost--but getting to that point takes some serious practice."", ""While playing guardian angel for Harold usually involves protecting or helping him, you can also harness your heavenly powers to hinder the more seasoned speedsters. In addition to shifting platforms beneath their swift feet to ensure that they jump to their deaths, you can cut ropes just before they grab them, raise ramps theyre about to ascend, and generally make their lives a living hell. If you've ever envied Lucys habit of pulling that football from poor Charlie Brown's path, you'll have as much fun tricking these clueless humans as you do helping Harold."", ""As satisfying--and sadistic--as it may be to pull the rug out from under the competition, they sometimes spawn right where they left off or, worse, further ahead of Harold. This odd design choice doesn't affect the races' pace unfairly, as Harold enjoys this benefit as often as his competitors do. Still, it would be more visually satisfying to see your targets consistently trailing Harold after falling victim to your well-timed traps."", ""In addition to altering the world to keep Harold on the quickest, safest route, you must carefully monitor and manage puff power. This collectible gift from the gods not only fuels Harold's speed boost--via a swift lightning bolt to the backside--but it also grants extra lives. I found myself using it more for the former, as it's the most effective way to put the pokey protagonist in the lead. Plus, the punishment for dying isn't so severe that bonus lives are a big deal; quick respawns and restarts ensure that you're never out of the race for long. Regardless of how you decide to use puff power, though, managing the scarce resource quickly becomes as important as ensuring that Harold doesn't get a face full of spikes."", ""Harold's gameplay is complemented by a hand-drawn art style that wouldn't look out of place in a 90s era Disney film. Seriously, swap the runners--during the jungle races--with the cast of The Lion King, and the action wouldn't miss a visual beat. The pop-off-the-screen art style isn't limited to static backgrounds, either; characters animate in amazing, cartoony detail, and gameplay elements, like rope bridge planks that can be popped to persuade Harold to pick up the pace, bring the pretty presentation to life. Sadly, Harold's steep difficulty doesn't leave you with any time to ogle the gorgeous surroundings like a first time tourist. As aesthetically pleasing as the presentation is, only the most skilled players will enjoy having their eyes and reflexes engaged simultaneously."", ""Harold is at its fleet-footed best when everything clicks; when your divine guidance not only propels the protagonist to victory, but also leaves his cocky competition on the wrong end of a devious trap. But these momentum-fueled moments will be experienced by only the most dedicated players. And even genre enthusiasts will occasionally be let down by the gamepad-only controls; the inputs are generally spot-on, but the mouse-and-keyboard crowd might miss the precision of their preferred set-ups when they're called upon to manage multiple tasks simultaneously."", ""Although this genre's been done to death, Harold's inspired levels, imaginative mechanics, eye-popping presentation, endless charm, and steep challenge separate it from the pack. It's only that latter element that crosses the line, sometimes making Harold more frustrating than fun. This games reflex-taxing level of difficulty isn't for the faint of heart. However, if you're not afraid of a few laps on the trial-and-error treadmill, Harold might just become your next endless-runner fixation."", ' ']"Kevin VanOrd,21-Apr-15,VoidExpanse Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/voidexpanse-review/1900-6416112/,4,PC,"[""My faction's commander gave me a special weapon for destroying alien hives in a single shot, but it wouldn't fit in my ship. I left it in my inventory for later use, but at some point in my travels, it disappeared (perhaps I sold it by mistake?), and I could not find a way to retrieve a new one. The contact that had given it to me had nothing more to say, and none of the stations I visited sold such a weapon. So I was left to my own devices, slowly whittling down hives while accompanied by a useless companion that could fend off attacking aliens and space pirates, but could do no damage to the hive itself. I spent a half-dozen hours hammering away at these things, laboriously zooming back and forth between alien systems and bases where I could refuel and refill ammunition. After a while, I could finally afford a better hull, and I presumed my path to victory--a path without the disappearing superweapon--would be clearer."", ""Instead, my new fighter made things worse by allowing me to only equip weapon types with limited ammo reserves. I wasted precious minutes flying to a base seven systems away so that I could reload, only to return to the alien system and find the hive had gained back all of its health. It was here that VoidExpanse and I parted ways after 25 hours of spacefaring tedium and shallow questing, and I can't say I'll miss repeating the same four side missions over and over again."", ""It didn't have to be this way; it never does. VoidExpanse is built from a proven foundation, recalling every space sim in which you crisscross the galaxy, buying low and selling high. In VoidExpanse's case, this all occurs on a 2D plane upon which you zoom from one space station to another, mining minerals from asteroids and shooting down space pirates along the way. With each accomplishment, you earn not only money but experience, which you then apply to skills that improve your flight agility, open access to new weapons, and enhance your financial standing."", '2D plane aside, this is Freelancer, or DarkStar One, or X3: Reunion, a game that encourages you to find your inner Han Solo, gaining funds by performing odd jobs, aligning yourself with a faction, and destroying whatever enemies stand in your way. Those games built adventures around these basic systems; VoidExpanse, on the other hand, rarely expounds upon the fundamentals. You do odd jobs for your chosen faction so that you can join its ranks, and at least those tasks mix things up a little. You even get choices to make, potentially befriending or alienating a contact depending on how successful you are at hacking a terminal, or convincing a pesky pirate to leave his enemy alone instead of firing on him at first glance.', ""The rare story-based diversion is not enough to brighten up the dreary pace that soon develops, however. VoidExpanse recycles the same few missions over and over again: Mine some minerals, deliver this package, kill this pirate, rescue these survivors. This is the steady diet of quests you feast upon if you have any hope for forward progress, unless you prefer to ferry supplies and the spoils of random enemy encounters from one system to another, seeking the highest possible prices. Trading is a common activity in space exploration games, but the lack of visual variety squashes exploration flat. Backdrops are generically pretty displays of green and purple nebulae stretching across starfields, and space vessels lack the drama of pop culture's most iconic craft; They are built for function, apparently, and not for form. But it is form that such a repetitive game needs to thrive, and what starts as a fun but formulaic adventure grows tiresome."", ""Combat is functional, at least, and supports two different control schemes, one of which allows you to drive the ship with the mouse, and the other of which separates aiming and movement. It is the latter scheme that affords finer control, and there is inherent appeal at hovering your targeting reticule over a pirate or an alien pod, launching missiles at it, and watching it explode. Alien ships are particularly mobile, so while most encounters aren't demanding unless you wander into systems you shouldn't be exploring yet, some battles keep you circling and reward precise aiming."", 'The main reason to press forward is to earn more currency and more experience, leaving behind your paltry vessel and starter gadgets for a more powerful and roomy ship. There are slots for weapons, shields, engines, and so forth, along with places to equip consumables (good for a resupply of hull strength, for instance) and boosters (good for, say, improving your defenses or supporting your energy supply). But all the incremental improvements represented by ship advancement and skill choices are at the service of repetitive sights, repetitive travel, and repetitive actions. In time, the few spots of joy are overwhelmed by the annoyances, such as the suicidal way the companion you later earn keeps ramming into alien hives until he explodes, and an autopilot that sometimes steers around obstacles, and other times bounces your ship against asteroids and space stations.', ""Galaxies are procedurally generated--and you can join other players' galaxies in online play--but those options bring little diversity to VoidExpanse. In the case of galaxies, the variables have too little effect on the pace of exploration to be meaningful; In the case of online play, the community is too small to make multiplayer worth investigating. Going online means following the same path you would if you played on your own, except you might encounter another player to shoot or ignore. In fact, VoidExpanse is toothless in general, lacking the mystery and suspense that could have propelled it through the universe."", ' ']"Jason Venter,21-Apr-15,Affordable Space Adventures Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/affordable-space-adventures-review/1900-6416111/,8,Wii U,"['In a different 1995, a company called Uexplore began offering cost-effective trips to a distant planet. Upon arriving at their destination, private citizens piloted miniature ships known as Small Craft as they explored peaceful environments on the planet Spectaculon, taking in the alien sights and claiming territory for their own. After three days, a ship picked them up, and they returned home to tell others of the grand adventures waiting at the edge of the universe.', ""Affordable Space Adventures is the story of one pilot--you--who is nearly done enjoying an excursion to that same distant planet. Suddenly, everything goes wrong. The carrier ship you are supposed to ride home in crashes and leaves you stranded until you can find a functioning communication pod and send a distress signal. Unfortunately, the surrounding environment isn't nearly as hospitable as the promotional videos led you to believe. You need to use every function your diminutive vessel possesses if you want to live to enjoy a bright tomorrow."", ' ', ""At a glance, Affordable Space Adventures doesn't look particularly unique. It could easily be mistaken for a horizontal shooter like R-Type or Gradius, only with better graphics. However, the emphasis here is on solving puzzles rather than explosions and high scores. There's no thumping soundtrack, only ambient noises and the occasional bit of piano work that barely even registers. Truly intense moments are quite rare, but the experience is likely to stick with you for a long time because it doesn't feel like a hollow imitation of classic digital journeys you may have already taken."", ""The game's interface deserves much of the credit for that accomplishment. Using the gamepad, you control the Small Craft with the left analog stick while the right one aims a spotlight that can also scan for potential hazards or fire flares. That's basic enough, but your vessel improves over time as its features come back online. You soon find yourself monitoring thruster levels, stability, and even gravity controls. Eventually, you're able to switch between engines on the fly and activate boosts. The various options are presented on the gamepad screen in a manner that feels like part of the experience rather than just a generic control scheme, and this setup is used in some interesting ways as the adventure unfolds."", ""Early stages lead you through verdant environments, but you soon head beneath the planet's surface to explore dangerous interior areas patrolled by sentries and floating pods. If you attract their attention, they'll swiftly take you out of action, which means you must make frequent adjustments to sneak by them undetected. In the opening areas, changing from one engine type to another is often sufficient because you put out less electricity or noise. Later puzzles grow increasingly demanding, though, and you sometimes have to get more creative and take bigger risks. In a vertical shaft, for instance, you might need to briefly kill your engine so you can drop past a drone that is alerted by sound, but then you want to bring your thrusters roaring back to life in time to avoid dropping across the path of a nasty laser beam."", ""Most stages aren't especially large, but there are plenty of them to traverse. Checkpoints are placed at reasonable intervals, which is important given how easy it is to meet a premature end. If you clear a puzzle, you're seldom forced to do so repeatedly to try your hand again at an obstacle further down the line that is giving you fits. Affordable Space Adventures is by no means an easy game, but it's also not overly concerned with putting you through the wringer for no good purpose. Once you have a feel for things, you can probably get through everything in a couple of hours without much fuss, but your first trip through could easily take several times that long, particularly if you refuse to take advantage of the option to lower the difficulty between levels."", ' ', ""Returning to Affordable Space Adventures down the road should be easy because you can save up to three adventures at once. You can also revisit any stage you've already cleared by selecting it from a map. There are only a few tutorials throughout the experience, each limited to a few quick text prompts, so you won't have to wade through a bunch of filler if you decide to take another run at it. Another reason to revisit the campaign is to enjoy the game's multiplayer support. Any time you load a save file, you can assign second and third players their own tasks on Wii remotes and Wii U pro controllers. One player can control the ship, another can direct the spotlight, and a third can make internal adjustments on the gamepad."", ""By nature of the game's design, teamwork and careful coordination are required in order to find success. Whoever has the gamepad at the moment also has a lot of power, and may find it difficult to resist killing the engine in the middle of a daring maneuver, with disastrous but short-lived results. Eventually, everyone will surely agree that it's time to do things right, and reaching an area goal together without too many mistakes always feels satisfying. It's a refreshing option, though it naturally wreaks havoc on the sense of isolation that the single-player mode so beautifully establishes."", ""Although the game generally does a good job of anticipating and avoiding basic technical issues that might have dampened the experience--the controls are suitably precise, and the action is silky smooth, at least when your ship isn't sputtering through the early areas after recovering from early damage--it's still not without occasional faults. A couple of the later areas are overly demanding on the default difficulty setting, requiring precise timing and quick finger work for more extended periods as you are forced to stealthily navigate corridors stuffed full of floating sentries. The need for frequent adjustment can get tedious, particularly because the ship's settings revert to a safe default whenever it is taken out of commission. If you're retrying an area and you want to take another run at a particular gauntlet, you have to make a bunch of tweaks before you're even in a position to engage the engine. That slows down the pace and can make gameplay monotonous, but it's fortunately the exception and not the rule. Finally, in a few instances, load screens wear out their welcome, including the one that lingers when you first boot up the game, but those delays aren't persistent enough to ruin the experience."", ""Perhaps someday, space travel really will be cheap, safe, and available from a company much like Uexplore. That day probably won't come during our lifetimes, though, which leaves us to seek our thrills in movies and games instead.

Apparently, the box holds a precious artifact left from the time of the First Civilization, but it is simply the ultimate in MacGuffins; it's the Maltese Falcon, the briefcase from Pulp Fiction, and the Ark of the Covenant. What it does is irrelevant and never elaborated upon, at least not in this story, for its purpose is to kick an adventure into action--in this case, a beautiful and ultimately boring trek that cribs from Mark of the Ninja but can't capture the earlier game's cleverness or excitement. It's tempting to praise Assassin's Creed Chronicles: China for squeezing the series' signature elements into two-and-a-half dimensions, and for making stealth gameplay more vital than it has been in an Assassin's Creed game for years. But Chronicles rests on being pretty, adding new mechanics over time but flattening the pace and allowing exploits and glitches to suck out the rising tension."", 'If a game must rest on being pretty, then at least Chronicles makes the most of it. This side-scrolling stealth game is overflowing with watercolor beauty. In one level, an impossibly large, bright moon rises in the sky, shining through the mist and illuminating willow trees in the foreground, which have the natural smudges and brushstrokes you would expect to see from the Qing masters. Elsewhere, a distant waterfall glows of its own accord, as if pure moonlight had been mixed into the paint that created it. Each scene comes to life with an inviting softness; even simple gray walls depict hushed details, like an underlying paperlike texture, where darker rings reveal where water droplets might have landed on the canvas.', ""It's a gorgeous style, relegated to an atmospheric role; Chronicles' wan storytelling, which mostly occurs in hand-drawn interstitials, doesn't engage in much world- or character-building, leaving the art to provide the game's aesthetic, along with an unobtrusive, string-heavy soundtrack. As Shao Jun, a silent killer trained by none other than Assassin's Creed II hero Ezio Auditore, you move through these spaces, sneaking past patrolling guards and avoiding their vision cones; they cannot see more than 20 feet in front of their own faces, and will not notice you at all when they engage in conversation with each other. Avoidance means slipping behind a pillar with a flick of an analog stick, hanging from a front facing ledge, spidering along a ceiling, or tumbling into a pile of hay. (Of course, in Assassin's Creed fashion, you will occasionally make a leap of faith into one of these bales, an action as satisfying to perform in two dimensions as in three.)"", 'You make your way from one array of guards to another, sometimes flinging your rope dart towards an overhang and swinging towards the camera (or away from it) and into a different adventuring layer. Chronicles makes good use of these layers, giving its best levels a sense of depth. You spend more time, however, navigating past the guards that bar your way, either by sneaking around them, stealthily assassinating them, or, rarely, by directly confronting them. My favorite approach was assassination, because it is in silent assassination that Chronicles stays truest to the games that preceded it. When you plunge your hidden dagger into an enemy from behind, you hear an eerie crunch as metal permeates flesh; your target grunts and falls to the ground, and blood seeps across the corpse and dissipates as if soaking into the paper upon which the game is drawn. Performing an assassination while hanging from above is even more enjoyable, thanks to the way Shao Jun points her blade downward as she falls, as if absolving herself by letting gravity perform the cruel deed. Later on, you can sprint forward and slide into unaware guards, which makes for a smooth and rewarding way to combine momentum and quiet butchery.', ""The game awards you the most points for complete avoidance, yet it is when skirting around your enemies that Chronicles' flaws most often surface. In most stealth games, there is intrinsic reward in sticking to the shadows--or in this case, slipping into a dark doorway, or dropping into crevasses that guards ignore unless you've alerted them to your presence. Yet over the games four-hour (or so) running time, the challenge rarely grows. You earn upgrades to your stealth repertoire as you progress, such as a limited ability to flit from one cover position to the next as if you were a ghost on methamphetamines, but there is no sense of rising anxiety. The puzzles don't noticeably increase in complexity, keeping pace with your new moves but not pushing beyond them, and a few ideas--wind chimes that jingle if you don't crouch under them, for instance--appear too rarely to invigorate any given level."", ""In time, you discover ways to exploit the AI's limitations, rushing out of guards view if you alert all of them, and waiting to return until they resume their patrols just a few seconds later. Of course, you could accuse many stealth games of allowing similar exploits, but in Chronicles, each guard is leashed to such a limited area that the ease with which you can simply sprint away and wait it out makes the entire setup feel contrived--quite a feat in a genre that, by nature, can feel particularly game-ish. And occasionally, the game doesn't know how to respond to your reactions and glitches out. At one point, the AI remained on high alert even though I'd escaped the area and was no longer in view; at another, two guards got stuck in place as they searched for me, halting the game and forcing me to leap out of hiding just so I could put the adventure back in motion."", 'This side-scrolling stealth game is overflowing with watercolor beauty.', ""Going toe-to-toe with the enemy is an option, yet an unsatisfying one. Combat has never been Assassin's Creed's strong suit, but swordplay has always featured an understandable rhythm. In Chronicles, you are meant to avoid combat if possible; perhaps battle was made to be purposefully awkward, so that you avoid it when possible. Design choice or not, fending off patrolmen is hardly fun. It's possible to escape with your life if you are incredibly careful and alert, even when flanked on both sides by multiple sword- and gunmen, but the entire affair is clumsy, and death is quick in many of these situations, regardless. There is no cadence to enemy behavior, nor do the fiddly controls invite fluid motion. Direct confrontation is best circumvented, making a boss fight that requires combat all the more mind-boggling."", ""Another boss fight puts to use your throwing knives, one of a few gadgets you have on hand for solving Chronicles' super-easy pseudo-puzzles. You can distract and lure enemies by whistling or throwing a projectile, and momentarily stun them with fireworks, but the predictability of level layouts and ease of AI exploitation means that your strategies can remain the same from start to finish. Ironically, this stealth game's finest moments arrive when it allows you to break free and sprint ahead in order to flee encroaching danger, such as a blazing fire. In no way do these escape sequences match those from the recent Ori and the Blind Forest, but they are the closest Chronicles comes to delivering the series' signature freerunning. You vault over obstacles and slide into shellshocked guards, cutting them down as you rush from danger, watching Templar baddies succumb to flames and crumbling infrastructure. It's a lively diversion in a game that is otherwise mostly devoid of forward momentum. You know the end is about to arrive because the cutscene narration tells you as much, and because the music's tempo has increased, but the gameplay hasn't built to this moment. The credits roll. The game is over. But there was no more excitement in that finale than there was in the opening minutes."", ""Chronicles' passive pacing is a shame, because the pieces, combat notwithstanding, are mostly strong. Furthermore, the exquisite environments craft a setting that makes me eager to see the two upcoming sequels--Chronicles: India, and Chronicles: Russia--in action. If they follow in Chronicles: China's footsteps, they will be beautiful to behold. I hope, however, that unlike the first entry, they take the leap of faith required to make them play as boldly as they look.""]"Kevin VanOrd,20-Apr-15,The Charnel House Trilogy Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-charnel-house-trilogy-review/1900-6416110/,5,PC,"[""In The Charnel House Trilogy, I found a box full of dirt and worms in a train compartment, where a groaning freak was protecting it. I understand what that box represents, but I'm perplexed by The Charnel House Trilogy itself, a side-scrolling, low-resolution, point-and-click adventure that depicts a series of unsettling images that never coalesce into a story worth connecting with."", ""That isn't to say that The Charnel House Trilogy's three-chapter mystery is overly secretive, only that, unlike the train it takes place on, it never arrives at a distinct destination. In fact, one of the game's central enigmas is overtly revealed in much of the preceding dialogue, causing later events to land with too little weight, their power sucked away by lines that unearth secrets before they're given enough time to fester and simmer. This occurs in the game's central chapter, Sepulchre, which was originally released as a standalone short in 2013, and is notable for its overt but unsettling story of Harold, a man on a train. Yet like so many allegorical works, Sepulchre is not really a story about a man on a train--it's a story about mistakes and consequences, about how a single choice sets devastating events into unstoppable motion."", ' ', ""It's difficult to analyze a game like this without divulging key information, and almost every detail of Sepulchre--its main character's profession, the name of the aforementioned groaning freak, the state of the train's windows--points to its obvious conclusion. And its that lack of subtlety that proves the chapter's ultimate unraveling. This kind of setting has been used in a similar manner in fiction many times before, leaving the game's individual sights and sounds to provide most of the impact. I did find myself pulled in by some of these details: the high-pitched buzz that punctuated an important moment, the horror of the lights blinking off and on again, and the troubling sight of particularly oversized luggage among them. Yet given all the foreshadowing, I was only mildly disturbed; with the wind snuffed from Sepulchre's sails so quickly, I could only wonder which path it might take to arrive at its obvious finale."", ""Sepulchre is bookended by another story, told in chapters titled Inhale and Exhale. Inhale is remarkably short, and unusual in how it almost parodies other point-and-click adventures, to the game's overall detriment. The Charnel House Trilogy is hardly humorous, so Inhale's self-referential in-jokes, such as the heroine's sarcastic description of an object behind a lamp that clearly isn't there, sets a tone the ensuing adventure doesn't follow through on. It is an odd prologue, providing some background on Alex, The Charnel House Trilogy's other main character, but its out-of-place humor, its focus on puzzles, and its failure to adjust object interaction dialogue after certain story events make it a poor tone-setter for what's to follow. (Alex's reactions to books in her bookcase, for instance, make no sense once the related puzzle has been solved.)"", ' ', ""Exhale is the final and longest chapter, and its story is simultaneously more straightforward and more vague than Sepulchre's. The events that led to Alex's presence on the train are plainly exposed, yet the game's attitude towards her is more positive than its ultimate depiction of Harold. Alex's choices drove her towards her predicament, yet her horror is not self-made in the way Harold's is. Alex's role as victim allows The Charnel House Trilogy's horror elements to finally bloom, driving Alex to learn hair-raising truths, and intriguingly, to interact with her past more directly than Harold does. Alex's awareness of her unusual circumstance is the game's most successful narrative beat, as it happens. She accepts the supernatural turn of events, and uses it as an opportunity to grow. What she discovers is horrifying, but where Harold can only accept fate, Alex tries to direct it."", ""There are other players in this story whose roles are left mostly unexplored, though The Charnel House Trilogy's conclusion hints that there will someday be answers to lingering questions. If you wonder why I haven't described the game's puzzles in much detail, it's because there isn't much to describe. You have an inventory that holds objects like your wallet, or cigarettes and a lighter, but most of the time, the dialogue informs you what you must do and where you must go; your interactions aren't usually puzzle-solving so much as they are direction-following. The Charnel House Trilogy is focused almost exclusively on its story, a story I wish impacted me more than it did. Inhale's in-jokes about adventure games and video game reviewers left me cold; Sepulchre's obvious foreshadowing neutered the story before it had any hope of grabbing me. It was Exhale that pulled me in, and its final, unresolved events left me longing for clarity, yet thankful for story strands that give me something to chew on. Overall, however, I am left puzzled by The Charnel House Trilogy, not because I don't understand it, but because its mishmash of themes and tones can't find a way to coexist.""]"Cameron Woolsey,20-Apr-15,"Slow Down, Bull Review - GameSpot",http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/slow-down-bull-review/1900-6416107/,6,PC,"[""Poor Esteban has a bit of an image problem. The shy, blue bull wants nothing more than to collect vibrant decorations to use in his art to share with the world. Sadly, due to his perfectionist nature, he is never satisfied with anything he creates. That is the conceit of the Insomniac-developed Slow Down, Bull, a game set up to donate half its profits to Starlight Children's Foundation, a charity aimed at improving the lives of children and their families. Slow Down, Bull is an item-collection game with wisdom to share for the overachievers in all of us. It's a fair game, if not an innovative one, pleasant to the eyes, though unfortunately held back in places due to rigid controls and some frustrating level design."", ""In Slow Down, Bull, you don't control Esteban so much as you guide his direction. The bull dashes forward across colorful 2-D landscapes. You can alter his course only by pressing two buttons which steer him left or right, accessing these buttons either by the clicks of a mouse, or the triggers on a controller. You bounce off walls to gain speed, avoiding dangerous obstacles and wandering creatures that inhabit the worlds, while collecting decorations ranging from buttons to shells and googly eyes--which follow in a floating clump behind him--for Esteban's beloved art projects, all within a time limit. Ramming trees and hedges along the walls causes them to drop decorations as well as stars, which add a multiplier bonus to the items you collect, while picking up random spawning clocks provides a few extra seconds."", ""Stress is the central element to watch for in Slow Down, Bull. It quickly builds up every time you steer, as well as when you hold down the buttons to briefly charge forward. Reaching the breaking point causes Esteban to become enraged and lose control, sending him on a path of destruction, trampling decorations into useless grey clumps. Hitting one of the many meandering inhabitants scatters your inventory onto the ground. And the inhabitants become impossible to avoid if they're right in front of you when Esteban snaps under pressure. Running straight, bouncing into walls, or splashing into a pool of refreshing water causes Esteban's stress levels to fall back to normal."", 'The progression in Slow Down, Bull takes its cues from many popular mobile games. As in Vector or Candy Crush Saga, levels are split into sections, each ending in a locked gate. Opening the gate requires you to collect a set number of hoof prints (replacing the more common stars), which are gathered by reaching point objectives during levels. You can collect up to three colored hoof prints in a level. The required number of decorations needed to gather all three is displayed by a progress bar that fills with every payload of collectables dropped into bins that dot each level. Finishing a stage rewards you with a single hoof print, but moving on from a section can require multiple attempts.', ""Slow Down, Bull is challenging, though mostly in a positive way. As your bull-steering expertise grows, so too does your ability to gather even more treasured goods. You will begin to notice the areas in levels which promise to yield a high number of trinkets, as well as recognize the best times to turn in your collection of items before returning to nab some stars in order to eventually yield an even larger surplus of decorations. In many of the more well-designed levels, gathering two or even three hoof prints occurs smoothly, leaving you feeling both rewarded and satisfied. However, this isn't always the case."", ""There are a few levels that are far too trying in their attempt to stop your decoration-collecting schemes, made more difficult due to stiff controls. These stages waste little time swarming their rooms and corridors with vase- and window-carriers, blocking all but the narrowest of escape routes. If you can imagine awkwardly steering a bovine rocket through these obstacles, as you try to gather random souvenirs while an angry bull hunter gives chase, knowing that one mistake means a restart, then you have a sense of just how aggravating this game can become. Better controls could have made things flow more naturally, but sadly they only exacerbate the issue. When you're presented with too many obstacles (and you will be), trying to make precise turns to dodge them becomes a useless endeavor. It becomes especially difficult when much of that fight is against Esteban's fickle stress level. During the worst moments, for example, trying to hastily avoid every danger onscreen merely enrages the stressed-out Esteban, who runs directly into the very enemy you're desperately trying to avoid in the first place. Let's just say that Esteban isn't the only one occasionally hitting his head against a wall over events in Slow Down, Bull."", ' ', ""The playful, clever art design, however, is wonderful, and kept me from staying too irritable with the light-hearted Slow Down, Bull for long. The aesthetics shrewdly mimes what you would expect from a child's imaginative art class presentation. Popsicle sticks make up barriers encompassing scenery crafted of pieces of green and yellow construction paper, creating a colorful grassland field, where blue patches of water crumple and bend as Esteban tramples across. In other areas, colored pasta makes up the shells of a sandy beach, and pink flowers attached to sticks bring the beautiful pink hues of a cherry blossom tree to Japanese-themed stages. Esteban himself is made up of blue and purple hatching lines of a crayon or colored pencil. This drawing technique is further highlighted in the game's adorable cut scenes, which star Esteban and other characters such as his sassy feline sister Mango and the relentless bull catcher Annette."", ""Despite some nagging issues, Slow Down, Bull is charming, with plenty of good messages to share for the whole family. During some cut scenes, the game takes a moment to provide lines of encouragement, from the value of hard work to never giving up on your goals, even if what you create, be it art or otherwise, isn't quite perfect. It's fair to say that the game would sit well with children or parents looking for a game with a cheerful nature and some worthwhile advice--though some of the more difficult stages do tarnish the theme. Still, Slow Down, Bull is a mildly entertaining little adventure, worth a look if only to help support a good cause. And that's something of which I feel Esteban would calmly approve.""]"Peter Brown,17-Apr-15,Mortal Kombat X Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mortal-kombat-x-review/1900-6416101/,8,Xbox One,"[""With the reboot in 2011, Mortal Kombat matured from a curious fighting game series to one that's worthy of tournament-level competition, and with Mortal Kombat X, we get the next step in the evolution of its fighting system. New features such as fighting-style variations and a stamina meter enhance the chaos, giving you more to consider before and during a fight. As much headway as Mortal Kombat X has made in regards to the fighting system, the series' other mainstay trait has grown in step. Fatalities and other gruesome attacks are the series' goriest yet, and while not all of them fall into the slapstick category, there are plenty that make you laugh due to the absurdity on display."", ""Mortal Kombat X upholds the series' legacy, which is evident in the story mode and the return of a dozen classic characters. Once again, the focus is on the battle between realms, elder gods, and humanity. The introduction of a few new faces on the side of Earthrealm, the good guys, freshens things up, although not as much as you would hope. The inclusion of the offspring of legacy characters, like Johnny Cage and Sonya Blade's daughter, Cassie, may prove to be intriguing for die-hard fans of Mortal Kombat's lore, but with the exception of Takashi Takeda (Kenshi's son) and Kung Jin (the younger cousin of Kung Lao), most of them are too similar to their relatives and ultimately fail to stand out in a meaningful way."", 'There are also a handful of new bad guys, though ""fresh"" may not be the best word to describe their grotesque visages. Characters such as the insect like D\'vorah and the gunslinger Erron Black inject new personalities into the series\' aging roster and introduce new fighting styles. D\'vorah strikes with spider-like arms that spring from her back, Erron Black uses firearms, and the fighting duo called Ferra Torr is comprised of a little girl who commands a hulking brute from atop his back. The new characters on each side of the battle fit into their respective factions, but it\'s the bad guys that are most notable, largely because they are original creations, rather than derivations from pre-existing characters.', ""If you care about Mortal Kombat lore, you will get a lot out of the story mode, which has excellent voice acting and a handful of unpredictable developments that affect long-standing relationships. It's not a story that everyone will relate to, sadly, with only a couple of scenes that deliver emotional moments. Cassie Cage may be a boring character, but she provides the necessary motivations for Johnny Cage and Sonya Blade to explore their feelings, and ultimately, grow as people by the time the credits roll."", ""Even if you don't care about the made-for-fans story, it's hard not to appreciate the new fighting engine, which is the smoothest the series has ever seen. It's not a sea change from the last game, but you quickly appreciate that combos are more fluid and that animations are more nuanced. The meter you charge by taking hits and doling out special moves returns from the last game, allowing you to power-up special attacks, break enemy combos, and perform an x-ray attack, which reveals the insides of one opponent while the attacker breaks them into pieces in slow motion, accompanied by excruciating moans of pain. The introduction of a stamina bar limits your ability to spam dashing maneuvers, which makes it more difficult for you to rely on spacing alone to win a fight. Likewise, the interactive elements in each stage, which allow you to pummel your opponent with a background item, or escape a corner by leaping off of a large object, can only be used if you have enough stamina. This particular meter recharges on its own, but it takes long enough--relative to the pace of a heated battle--to make it an important consideration during high-level matches."", ""Local battles are great fun, but online matches are where modern fighting games thrive in the long run. Chances are, the best players in the world don't live on the same street, leaving online matches as the true test of one's skill outside of tournaments. The netcode that drives Mortal Kombat X's online matches is fine, meaning that it will sometimes offer an experience that feels proper, but that you should expect laggy matches from time to time. When you get into a fight with a poor connection, you may as well exit and search for a new opponent, because it will be difficult to pull off simple combos and special moves. At that point, its a competition between man and machine. Thankfully, this is a rare occurrence."", 'One of the great aspects of Mortal Kombat X is the amount of non-traditional fighting game content. Towers are back, providing an arcade mode-like challenge, as well as a series of other themed battles that offer a wide variety of combat conditions. The Test Your Luck tower puts you in a series of fights with randomly selected modifiers, which mix up everything from terrain to physics to keep you on your toes and alter the way you approach a fight. The modifier-driven fights are also the crux of the new living towers, which offer fixed modifier sets and challenges, but are remixed every hour, every day, and every week, depending on the specific tower.', ""Mortal Kombat X also marks the introduction of factions, or teams, that compete on a worldwide scale. Joining a faction is the first thing you do after booting up the game, and as you fight in the game's various modes, you earn points for your faction and level up. Eventually you hit milestones that open up faction kills, which are essentially simpler versions of fatalities. Every week, a faction is chosen as the winner and its members earn a reward in the form of a faction kill or a cosmetic item. Once in a while, an invasion occurs and factions compete to fight a character with extreme rules, and the more you play, the more you contribute to the team's efforts. The faction system isn't the sort of feature that will grip your attention, but invasions are nice because they make you feel like you're contributing to a concentrated effort, rather than the long-winded score chase of the weekly faction war."", 'As you play Mortal Kombat X, you earn currency in the form of ""koins."" Koins are used to unlock movelist details for secondary fatalities (by default, secondary fatalities don\'t have inputs listed in the movelist menu), brutalities (another form of finishing move), fan art, and character skins, to name a few. You find these items in the Krypt mode, which is a first-person dungeon crawling game. The Krypt is composed of a handful of areas that are populated with tombstones, sarcophaguses, and other treasure chest-like containers. You need to spend koins to get at the treasures within, but there\'s a catch: you never know what you\'re buying until you\'ve purchased it. This adds an air of suspense and tension to each purchase, because you\'re either going to get something cool, or something lame. This would be easily dismissed if koins were more plentiful than they are, but they\'re currently doled out in small doses. One trip through the story mode nets you enough koins for but a small fraction of the items on display, and other modes are less generous, making the chase for unlocking the entire Krypt a long and arduous one. Like factions, it\'s not something worth focusing all of your effort on. Save that for learning characters and fighting styles, and go to the Krypt only as needed.', ""There is another option: you can pay real world money to unlock every item in the Krypt. All you need is $20 to bypass the slog of earning koins, but that isn't exactly cheap. Then again, neither is time, so it's a bit gross that the koin distribution is balanced in such a way that you are tempted to spend real world cash if you want to unlock brutalities and the like. Mortal Kombat X is a great fighting game with a wonderfully demented world and cast of characters, but when you're pressured into spending money, it's easy to lose focus on the positives. You can always ignore the options to buy items with real world money, such as awards that allow you to perform two button fatalities and the aforementioned Krypt unlocks, but the biggest item on the main menu of the game is a link to the game's store, with items you can purchase or look forward to purchasing in the weeks and months to come. You're teased with DLC for characters that you fight within the story mode, as though you aren't going to put two and two together and realize what a despicable bait and switch that is. There's so much to love about the new Mortal Kombat that it's a shame to see such blatant monetization practices overlap with your experience, whether you're looking for it or not. You can always choose not to pay out of pocket for anything, but you know in the back of your head that you're likely missing out on something."", ""Mortal Kombat X's lesser elements exist outside the most important part of the game: the fighting. A great roster with a wide range of diverse fighting styles and variations gives you plenty to play around with, and the new fighting mechanics add the right amount of depth to nudge Mortal Kombat X ever higher on the list of respectable fighting games. There's also the gruesome creativity, which is entertaining for its absurdity but shocking for its emphasis on acute torture. Although you can't escape it, Mortal Kombat X's violence doesn't come at the cost of great gameplay design; it's either your punishment for failure, or your reward for mastering the art of kombat.""]"Jeremy Signor,14-Apr-15,We Are Doomed Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/we-are-doomed-review/1900-6416100/,5,PS4,"[""The best twin stick shooters turn tension and survival into an accessible kind of thrill. There's something inherently satisfying about flying around and avoiding being hit as you shoot at the increasingly numerous ships. Threading the needle with your ship as you narrowly cut through a tight blob of enemies is exhilarating, and the sheer act of moving the other joystick in order to fire your weapon makes the barrier to entry almost nonexistent. Because of the simple concept and ease of playability, twin stick shooters occupy a flexible design space, one that can hold any number of new ideas and concepts effortlessly. Unfortunately, while We Are Doomed gets what's so appealing about the genre and applies it to make a satisfying shooter in its own right, it fails to justify its existence, thanks to a lack of new ideas and predictable enemy placement."", ""We Are Doomed makes an excellent first impression, thanks to its striking audiovisual presentation. The enemies and animations all combine to form the same kind of strikingly jagged, abstract aesthetic that was featured in Everyday Shooter, while the music and backgrounds grant a trippy touch of synesthesia similar to what you'd find in a Jeff Minter game. And though We Are Doomed only ever features one aesthetic tone, it fuses with the game's mechanics and progression in small, smart ways. The swirling pink and purple of the main stage juxtaposes with the level's boundaries, which are marked by a starry, spacy backdrop. When you clear a wave, the pinkness wipes away for a moment as space engulfs it before it returns to deliver a new round of foes to clear. Your laser weapon looks big and powerful, almost as if it's ripping at the edges."", ' ', ""Movement is as smooth and effortless as a twin stick shooter should be, and enemies are clearly visible. It's easy to learn their particular patterns quickly (though many just bimble around aimlessly). But most importantly, shooting things feels good. The giant beam not only looks impressive, but it feels powerful when you're slicing through enemies. You don't immediately destroy them when they touch your beam, as they can withstand maybe half a second of direct exposure, but you can feel that resistance as you wait for the moment when they break, and that makes the moment of destruction all the more satisfying. The superbeam is the satisfying pinnacle of the action, letting you fire an even longer, more powerful version of your beam for a short time. The superbeam feels amazing, since the resistance you felt from the vanilla beam disappears when you cut through entire blobs of foes as if they were butter."", ""We Are Doomed's bells and whistles are silenced, however, when you look past its presentation. The game can be played in an endless mode or in a finite waves mode that features thirty scripted waves of enemies to survive. It features only one weapon: A beam that constantly protrudes from your ship, but only reaches so far, like a lance. Gathering flashing cubes increases your score modifier, and also grants you access to the superbeam. And that's it. You get no alternate weapons beyond the beam, no smart bombs that let you relieve the pressure when you're about to get overwhelmed, and no other fancy options in your bag of tricks. Though there is some charm in the challenge of playing with a limited toolset, here it makes for a flat experience. All you're doing is carving through swarms of enemies in one specific way each and every time."", ""The big problem with We Are Doomed is how much it limits itself to its detriment. Not only do you get only one weapon, but the game also does nothing interesting with the environment or enemies. You end up shooting things like tiny squids, triangular missiles, and giant disco ball-like circles, but all they do is try to bump into you or shoot you. We Are Doomed features some non-enemy threats, but they also fall under the banner of ramming or shooting. There's so much potential for a wide variety of different encounters. Even genre stalwart Geometry Wars employed devices such as the black holes that messed with the gravity of the playing field. But We Are Doomed is unfortunately content merely to crowd you until you die."", ""That's the frustrating thing about We Are Doomed: Despite all these issues, you can have fun with it. Because Vertex Pop took so much care in making everything feel right, nothing gets in the way of your enjoyment. You'll still remember the near-deaths you deftly flew your way out of. You'll still panic as the blobs of enemies cluster in and choke every available escape route until there's nothing but death left. And you'll remember the elation when you clear all thirty waves. The problem is that you can get those exact experiences and more elsewhere, whereas We Are Doomed doesn't really care to stake its own claim in the crowded shooter space. You're not going to see the surprising environmental twists of the Geometry Wars games or the charming DIY spirit of Everyday Shooter. In reality, you're just playing Twin Stick Shooter: The Game."", ' ', ""Even a solid game needs some spice, and We Are Doomed never gives you much. You will certainly notice how good it feels to play the game, and the presentation is top notch, but it never really gives you a reason to care. Sure, you're thrown a bunch of stages including about seven different enemy types, but when the bump and shoot behaviors wear thin, you aren't left with anything more to look forward to. Soon, the only thing that's doomed is your waning interest.""]"Kevin VanOrd,13-Apr-15,Titan Souls Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/titan-souls-review/1900-6416098/,7,PC,"[""Titan Souls is a game of contradictions. It's difficult until it isn't. It's compelling until it isn't. And it's fun until it isn't, which fortunately the game understands, drawing to a close after four hours or so when the triumphs no longer outweigh the aggravations. It is the subject of difficulty that makes Titan Souls so unusual, however. This is a game about--and only about--boss battles. Your first step into an arena is likely to lead to death in a matter of seconds, but your moment of triumph, which might come after five, 10, or 20 attempts, may end the boss in a similarly brief span. And suddenly, a challenge that seemed insurmountable minutes before is now over before you can take a single breath. And you must wonder: How can something so hard also be so...easy?"", ""The answer lies within Titan Souls' very structure. You are a tiny archer who takes up very little space on screen, a pixelized adventurer with a single arrow providing your only protection from the monstrosities you face. The 2D world you explore may try to calm you with curlicues of wind, gently swaying brush, and light snowfall, but the dark forests and stone temples offer no hope to those that seek it. This place has no healing springs, no wildlife to tame, and no wolves to slay with a few well-aimed shots. It only hides bizarre deviants made of flesh and metal, each monstrosity designed to tower above your miniature frame moments before before destroying it."", ""Each boss fight, in turn, presents itself first as a puzzle to solve, and then as a challenge to be overcome. Entering an arena may lead to death in a mere second or two before you're able to even get your bearings. With each attempt comes more understanding, however. That tumbling yeti will likely squash you the first time you ever see him, and probably the tenth time too. A giant coal-powered skeleton head propels itself around the arena with spiked orbs, killing you not just by crushing you, but by driving you to cross the flames that rise from the arena's floor vents. So you process the relevant information. What is the creature's weak point? How does it move through the arena? Do you defeat it by using the arena in any way? Where one enemy is concerned, avoiding death means noting where shadows appear on the ground before you can be crushed by the objects that caused them. For another boss, counting the number of times it rotates before resting for a moment can prove helpful."", ""Now you know what must be done, and it's time to execute on your plan. Charging up your shot leaves your tiny archer unable to move--and retrieving your arrow means either picking it up where it last fell, or holding a button to summon it to you, a process that also stills you for as long as the button is held. The behemoth might be vulnerable to your single arrow for a fraction of a second, so you exploit the boss fight's rhythms as best you can, trying and trying until the moment comes, your arrow finds its mark, and the beast falls without a single cry of pain or declaration of future vengeance. It is simply stilled, accompanied by a dramatic drum cue, and the screen turns a sepia hue, reflecting the loss of the soul that once existed here. When you summon your arrow back to your bow, you also pull points of light representing the boss's soul to you, and they swirl about you as the music swells; it's a beautiful moment of triumph, and one of many examples of how Titan Souls' excellent audio design instills excitement and eases mounting frustration."", ""Victorious sound effects aside, Titan Souls' very design can lead to a disappointing anticlimax. Just as a swimming leviathan can murder you in a single stroke, so too can you murder it in a blink of an eye. A well-timed arrow shot just seconds after the battle begins can bring the baddie down, and leave you wondering why you stressed over such a simple endeavor. It was so hard--until it was easy. It's naturally fulfilling when you put this game's lessons to good use, but after eight or nine different boss battles, you know how each fight will end: you will make many attempts to fell the boss--and on a few frustrating occasions, many many attempts--before one last go, upon which you will deliver a precise shot that ends the action before it begins. "", ""And that is why Titan Souls is compelling--until it isn't. What starts as an interesting idea loses its shine as it nears its conclusion, and along with it, the sense of reward. Success can be its own reward in video games, but in Titan Souls' distilled formula, the only mystery to uncover is the behavior of the titan you have next to face. Some of these encounters are cleverly designed, but the cleverness is not so great as to mask the game's intrinsic austerity. Titan Souls also provides structural rewards that, frankly, aren't very interesting. Hard mode; a mode in which you cannot run or dodge; a mode in which you only have one life to live: these don't provide much reason to return unless you thrive on speedruns and ultimate mastery, nor does the final reveal, which you are privy to only if you defeat every boss, which is not required for you to officially beat the game."", ""Not that austerity must be a bad thing, only that Titan Souls stretches its single idea as far as it can go--and then a few battles beyond the limit. It's fitting that the world surrounding those battle is similarly simple. Unlike Shadow of the Colossus, the game I would say it most recalls, Titan Souls doesn't tell much of a story with its world, but it's at least a lovely place to be. You access boss fights from themed hubs, so you walk a short distance from a nearby save point to each nearby boss arena--and moving from one hub to another is a few minutes' journey. Those journeys have you crossing stone pathways, swimming across shallow pools, and riding mechanical platforms; giant eyeballs adorning nearby doorways follow you as you travel past, instilling unease."", 'It is the soundtrack and general audio that deserves the most credit for making this world enjoyable to pass through. (I wouldn\'t say ""explore"" is the right word, since there are no treasures to unearth or truly commanding sights to drink in.) One of the first bosses is a disembodied brain encased in ice, and the resounding clank it makes as it collides with walls gives the entire battle a tremendous sense of pressure and weight, while vivacious bongos exacerbate the battle\'s percussive feel. When you leave sunshine behind for snowy fields, the open strings of a fiddle recall similar tunes from the film Fargo, which also takes place in a frigid land. When green grass returns, a flute and guitar engage in a leisurely minuet, making your stroll feel particularly pleasant.', ""Don't let the soothing songs lull you, however: stress is always just a minute away, and once you have internalized Titan Souls' lessons, so is relief. In time, those lessons become exhausting; you keep studying the exam, yet fail it over and over again until, suddenly, you pass with little fanfare, and a new class begins. Luckily, before work comes joy, and in the few hours that Titan Souls maintains your interest, you prove that you--and the diminutive hero that you play--can change the world with incredible patience, and a single arrow.""]"Daniel Starkey,11-Apr-15,Slender: The Arrival Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/slender-the-arrival-review/1900-6416097/,7,Xbox One & PS4,"[""Slender Man has captured a large part of the popular psyche--large enough that two girls stabbed a third girl 19 times, and other children commit acts of arson, all in his name. I can't help but blend those headlines with subsequent forays into the Slender Man mythos. Although he is without a doubt fictitious--a legend manufactured wholecloth in full view of the internet's many denizens--he's transcended himself. He's now a self-reinforcing curiosity of the modern era, reflecting the deep-seated fears of our connected culture."", 'For those unfamiliar with this phenomenon, Slendy, as some affectionately call him, was born on the internet forums of the 21st century. A few Photoshop projects featured a thin, suited figure without an apparent face. The first few images of him depicted children running away--and right there, we have the seeds for a great ghost story. He is the embodiment of the unknown, and he preys on the weakest among us--children. From that point on, he became a meme in the truest sense of the word, evolving and changing to suit whatever the population thought would yield the most easily shared terror.', 'Slender Man is now a self-reinforcing curiosity of the modern era, reflecting the deep-seated fears of our connected culture.', ""So how does he terrorize us now? When he approaches, he causes electronics, particularly cameras, to malfunction and glitch out. He causes his victims to go mad. He's most aggressive when you're trying to look straight at him. Perhaps most tellingly, he tends to stick to rural areas."", ""Again, all this is purely fictitious, but it's interesting that so many of these individual threads converged into a single vision coherent enough to yield a substantive game in Slender: The Arrival. This coalescence of traits creates a compelling antagonist that preys on the modern. In our metropolitan world of smartphone cameras and nearly ubiquitous connections, a mysterious figure that resists investigation and cuts us off from our technological safety net is the ultimate terror."", ""Arrival benefits from these fears and pulls every psychological string. However, that's all it can do. From a play perspective, it's about as minimal as they come. You can pick up pages and notes strewn about the various levels; after the preface, you can pick up a simple flashlight. That lack of agency is powerful, though. From its nascent stages, it's clear that you're struggling to survive in the shadow of beings that sap all hope. Slender Man and his several proxies--corrupted and insane people he's brought under his influence--are cold and uncaring. They have no clear motive other than your defilement, and they are omnipotent. Slender Man, for example, can teleport, and there's nothing you can do to defend yourself from his tentacle-y arms but turn and run away. It's an impressive foundation, and it fills me with dread to this day."", 'Slender Man and his several proxies are cold and uncaring. They have no clear motive other than your defilement, and they are omnipotent.', ""I've played Slender and its expanded pseudo-sequel Arrival before, but when I ran through it again, that prior experience didn't help ease my fears. The world is cloaked in darkness, and all you have to push away a small sliver of that enveloping black is a small, barely functional flashlight. Against the dark, Slender Man's blank, white visage creates an arresting contrast every time he appears. The system creates procedurally generated jump scares using a weighty, pervasive atmosphere of vulnerability and helplessness. The same system went on to birth the popular Five Nights at Freddy's series."", 'Player death in Arrival takes on a whole new meaning without the predictability of those frights. I found myself afraid of being afraid, eager to see the game end so I could at last take a breath, relieved to be safe once again.', ""That near-constant level of stress would doom a longer game, but Arrival clocks in at just two hours. The console versions add a few extra levels that weren't present in the original PC release, and they pad out the tension with just a bit of calm to keep players from growing exhausted. On the flip side, the added sections dilute Arrival's already-tight focus. In its original incarnation, Arrival was an agonizing, frantic mystery. You stepped into the body of Lauren, a woman desperate to find any clues regarding the disappearance of her friend Kate. As you poked about Kate's house, you could gathered snippets of information suggesting that her mother had passed away and that her family had been facing financial trouble--leaving the possibility open for suicide. The more you learned, though, the grimmer the reality became."", ""The added sections dilute Arrival's already-tight focus."", 'A few side characters were present that were hinted to be the Slender Man. Because just moving around in any given level could prompt the appearance of the Slender Man, you always felt that the answers were out there, but you could never quite piece it all together. With the new areas, some of that mystery is gone, and Slender Man is established as some otherworldly being. That spoils a bit of the fun and raises plenty of questions about why Slender now attacks people, where he was before, how he came to be, etc. Without a plausible in-universe explanation, he loses just a bit of his mystique.', ""Despite that, Slender: The Arrival still got under my skin. I'm not quite as warm to it as I was before, but it's an eerie experience that's seeped into my real life. Now, on long car rides or when I'm in a sparsely populated area in the dead of night, I'll catch glints of light and my heart will stutter at the thought that Slender Man could be at the edge of my periphery. All I can do is turn away and keep walking.""]"Tyler Hicks,10-Apr-15,Infinite Crisis Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/infinite-crisis-review/1900-6416096/,6,PC,"[""Unlike the superheroes of comic books, Infinite Crisis makes no effort to hide its true identity. It is, through and through, a clear play for the lucrative MOBA market featuring familiar DC Universe characters as playable champions. While no one can fault Warner Brothers for wanting its franchise to be represented among the ever-growing population of MOBAs, you might have expected to see more effort to mask the face of gameplay we've seen regurgitated over the past few years."", 'Infinite Crisis follows a formula similar to most of the DotA and League of Legends knock-offs that have sprung up over the years. Each team has a nexus--er, power core--connected by lanes to the enemys power core. Those lanes have towers that need to be destroyed so you can reach the enemys core. Your champion starts out at level one and levels up by defeating wave after wave of minions--er, drones--and unlocking access to more powerful abilities and items that will help you combat the enemy champions.', ""If you only play the standard maps in DotA and League of Legends, you will find Infinite Crisis' default map a bit different from what youre familiar with due to the objectives beyond defeating towers and neutral monsters. At a certain point, power relays unlock that players capture by standing on them. Controlling two of the three relays enables stronger drones for your top lane, while controlling all three powers the drones in both lanes. The inhibitor/rax interaction of other games is completely absent in lieu of this territorial control element. The extra level of strategy involved in controlling the relays greatly affects gameplay: Getting your teammates to help you force away the lone enemy jungler trying to capture his own territory can mean a huge swing in power early on in the game and catalyze a wave of momentum leading to victory."", ""Although the majority of combat is intended to take place in the lanes, I found myself to be much more effective in the game's poorly-tuned Urban Jungle, where it is far too easy to get massive leads in credits (gold) over other players. It isn't clear at the outset, but the two camps near the center of the Coast City yield far more experience and credits without much more risk--controlling those two camps alone can slingshot you ahead of allies and enemies alike that stick to farming the lanes instead. As long as the game isn't particularly bloody, your jungler can find herself thousands of credits ahead of everyone else in the game, even without interacting with other players. This discrepancy in the expected balance sticks out like a sore thumb, and in my own play time, I was able to abuse that feature to drastic effect."", ""Infinite Crisis does have its own carbon copy of the DotA/LoL map along with a few others, but matchmaking queues for all of these are disabled due to population concerns, thus ensuring that everyone is funneled into the Coast City queue for fast matchmaking times. If you wish to play the other variants, you must have friends willing to join you in the custom lobbies. The queues for these maps could return in the near future if the game's population rises again, but in the interim, it's frustrating to see player choice diminished by players abandoning the DC Multiverse."", 'Champion design in Infinite Crisis is overtly familiar, with some skills being almost direct ports of their League of Legends counterparts, though no kit feels like a direct rip-off. The game does a good job of making each champions skill set make sense for that superhero--even the alternate universe versions of those heroes. The Flash is overloaded with mobility, as one would expect from the Fastest Man Alive. Green Lantern comes with massive magical nuke powers thanks to his ring. The Joker\'s play style can be summarized with the word ""trickster."" IC even brings out Superman\'s trusty canine, Krypto, whose entire gameplay kit revolves around him fetching a bone to empower his support abilities. Infinite Crisis also enlists the alternate Earths of Arcane, Atomic, Gaslight, Mecha, and Nightmare for champion designs. Gaslight\'s steampunkish designs and Nightmare\'s monsters both managed to output my favorite characters.', ""Infinite Crisis' main problem is that it lacks snappiness. It's hard to get a good grasp on just how much damage you're going to do, even after practice with certain champions. Playing Gaslight Catwoman, I only knew my assassination attempts would succeed if I engaged with someone low on health or massively overextended. If the target were at full health, it was a coin toss whether I would get the kill I was going for. This problem is exacerbated by underwhelming visual effects that don't deliver the justice one would expect from a clash between superheroes. Apart from a few exceptions, such as the Green Lantern incarnations' ring manifestations, the game's spell effects don't pop from the screen and encourage engagement in combat. The visuals fail to evoke excitement; Much like the drone minions, interacting with Infinite Crisis feels robotic and mechanical, turning the combat into the games biggest drone."", ""Another setback is the user interface. The main menu features an imbalanced presentation of relevant information versus auxiliary information. Achievement progress takes up nearly a quarter of the screen, while the game's shop, where players can unlock champions, skins, and stolen powers, is tucked away in the right-hand corner. Once in-game, the item shop is no easier to manage. Granted, the recommended item builds are easy to use (the game includes a button to auto-buy the next recommended item any time you can afford it and are near the shop), but the full list of items is displayed as icons, with no names showing unless you hover over the icons. You can sort items by what stats they give, but hunting down a specific item's passive effect gets tedious and slows down your gameplay. Learning how to use the item shop made me feel like I was memorizing vocabulary for third grade all over again, and it wasn't a pleasant experience."", ""By design, items also have their own problems; because Infinite Crisis doesnt include any component items and each item must be upgraded from its base form to its final form to unlock its passive effect, changing your item builds midgame to accommodate your team's needs or adjust for any new situations is much less efficient than it is in similar games. Items dont have branching upgrade paths, so once you've started an item, you're stuck with that path unless you sell it or start a new item."", ""The game is friendlier for newer players than some of its in-genre siblings, however. While League of Legends keeps rune slots locked until certain account levels, Infinite Crisis gives characters completed Augment/Mod kits they can use even at level 1. Players can purchase augments and mods to customize a character to their liking, but no player is at an outright disadvantage simply for being at a lower level. In this sense, Infinite Crisis improves upon existing MOBA conventions. Unfortunately, the game otherwise lacks the Old English finish it so sorely needed; Where's Alfred when you need him?""]"Cameron Woolsey,9-Apr-15,Paperbound Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/paperbound-review/1900-6416095/,7,PS4,"['In Paperbound, warriors rip through their paper confines to perform gravity defying battles across a host of colorful worlds. Ninjas clash with guardians of Egyptian pyramids, while demons and skull-headed monstrosities fight tooth and claw. Paperbound is a frantic arena game promising hours of vivid combat, though some flaws make sure those hours are short.', ""Like Gang Beasts and TowerFall Ascension, Paperbound is a local arena multiplayer game. There is no online component whatsoever, making the game a more natural fit in the midst of a party. There are options for bots if you can't manage to fill all four player slots, and they actually do a decent job at keeping the competition fierce. However, Paperbound is best when played with a group of people hollering and laughing at the chaotic action onscreen."", 'In Paperbound, warriors rip through their paper confines to perform gravity-defying battles across a host of colorful worlds.', ""Much of that fun comes quickly, thanks to Paperbound's effortless combat. The game offers a trinity of attacks: melee, projectiles, and bombs. Every one of the cartoonish characters come with his or her own aesthetically different, but functionally equal melee weapon--a comically oversized pencil, perhaps, or a sword--in addition to scissors to throw and an ink bomb. A flick of the right analogue stick sends a pair of glimmering scissors slicing through the air, instantly killing any foe it reaches, while holding a shoulder button down allows you to prep an ink bomb (a little red inkwell) in place of the scissors. You get one pair of scissors; a small icon floating above your head shows you when it's in your inventory (as with the ink bombs) at the start of each life. But you can pick up and store scissors stuck in the walls, floors, or other objects, allowing you to turn yourself into a scissor-flinging paper ninja--as long as your scissor greed doesn't get you snipped in the process. The ink bomb bursts in an explosion of black ink that can blot out several enemies at once in a single glorious splash. But unlike the scissors, which can travel from one end of a level to the other in a straight line, the ink bomb flies in an arc--so aim well, you only get one!"", ""Weaponry aside, Paperbound's main feature is gravity manipulation, which has its ups and downs (and no, I will never apologize for that pun). With a press of the button, you can send your nimble fighter from the ceiling to the floor or from one wall to the other. Changing gravity only affects your own character, so don't be concerned about someone else tossing you about. It can be fun, but mastering gravity and using it as an effective tool in Paperbound is, well, a tad tricky. The problem goes beyond just trying to get from one part of the map to the other. Changing gravity will cause you to be attracted to any nearby piece of land, floating or otherwise, so your plan to fly to a certain area of a map may not always end up in your favor. The challenge is elevated in levels with many floating islands, and it's easy to get frustrated while trying to understand the gravity twisting concept. I foresee issues with newer players trying to perform well against experienced ones who have already passed this tall hurdle."", 'Mastering gravity and using it as an effective tool in Paperbound is, well, a tad tricky.', 'Once everyone is on the same page, the action is an explosive brawl of clinking blades, sailing ink bombs, and raucous laughter. Battles in Paperbound are intense, as weapons clash and lethal scissors fill the air. Due to its rarity, picking off an enemy with a well-timed fling of the scissors is easily one of the most gratifying feelings you can find in any competitive arena game. In fact, as you become more experienced, you begin to grasp some of the finer details of the game\'s combat. Scissors and ink bombs, for example, can be deflected back toward attackers with a deft swipe of a melee weapon, swiftly demonstrating to any would-be assassin that you won\'t be caught with your paper trousers down. Using gravity to maneuver in mid-air also becomes more natural, allowing you to accomplish feats such as nabbing that perfect sniping position while ""floating."" If you\'re savvy enough, you will never have to touch ground as you fly around the map by rapidly tapping the gravity button. The most energetic matches are almost as entertaining to watch as they are to play, as tiny fighters zoom through the air, dodging and knocking away deadly projectiles like a silly action romp inspired by The Matrix and Inception.', ""Paperbound isn't nearly as tonally heavy as those films; its art is light and welcoming, if not particularly striking. Levels are grouped into a set of five books, each with a unique motif. One set of levels has you zipping around environments inspired by ancient Egyptian tombs, while another group mimics classic Japanese art. But while the look of the game is clean, the simplicity of the style isn't inventive enough to be memorable. However, several levels employ some nice visual flourishes worth mentioning. Tall grass and mushrooms sway as characters swiftly pass by, while floating particles of dust whip through the air with each melee clash and ink bomb explosion. The horror book levels, steeped in rich hues such as purple and green, feature the most interesting details, with curling pen scratches and, fixed in the background, blinking eyes and grinning skulls, giving everything a slight Tim Burton feel."", 'The action is an explosive brawl of clinking blades, sailing ink bombs, and raucous laughter.', ""Though it is steeped in adventurous, fairy tale themes, Paperbound is not quite a wonderland of different game modes. You can play in four modes either in a free-for-all or with teams: Classic Versus, Survival, Long Live the King, and Capture the Quill. These modes are more typical of the competitive genre, although they use some different names to describe age-old ways of playing. Classic Versus sets players against one another either alone or split into a team of two; survival is similar to versus, with each player granted a number of lives; Long Live the King is akin to Call of Duty's Juggernaut, in which a king earns points while being hunted and the player who kills the king becomes the new king. Finally, Capture the Quill is, obviously, Paperbound's take on capture the flag, except with a quill, inkwell, and so on."", 'Paperbound at least attempts to add its own flair into some of the modes by not giving the top player an instant win once the point goal is reached. Instead, in modes like Survival and Versus, scoring enough points opens a tear that appears in the levels fabric, which you must enter in order to make your escape with the victory; dying removes the tear, and you have to score another point to create another. This ramps up the challenge, giving other players a chance to make a comeback, all while creating some rather brief and shaky truces.', ""Beyond the handful of game modes, Paperbound doesn't have much else to offer. It is great in bursts, and when you have friends playing with you, Paperbound glows with energy. But the lack of online or additional content takes its toll. Yes, the matches are exciting but, while plenty of laughs and shouting can be had, that excitement wanes after several intense hours. Still, like a good short story, Paperbound is worth returning to on occasion when you would rather play something fun for a quick hour or so.

For the PlayStation 4 release of Bastion, I more often found myself appreciating the game's many nods to the novels of Cormac McCarthy, both in the easy (and a bit tired) parallels to the post-apocalyptic world of The Road, and in the main character of the Kid, who recalls a character of the same name in McCarthy's gore-drenched Blood Meridian."", ""You may not so readily notice these details, at least if you already own Bastion on one of the many systems it already graces, whether it's the Vita, the Xbox 360, or even Google Chrome. Nothing has changed, apart from the requisite upscaling to support the PS4's beefier resolutions; You find no new monsters barring your travels across the ruins of Caledonia, and discover no new weapons to whack them with. It's the same isometric hack-and-slash exploration game first released in the summer of 2011, when independent games were continuing to gain prominence across a number of platforms,"", ""And that's why, if you've never played Bastion before and you have a PS4, you should take this opportunity to jump in. Bastion draws heavy inspiration from McCarthy, yes, but it doesn't smother the experience with seriousness. It may feature a world that's falling apart in the aftermath of an initially unknown calamity, but this is no wasteland where the trees of Appalachia rot with the rest of the world; Bastion takes place in an impressively varied world that's almost ecstatic with hand-painted color--a world that falls back into place as you traverse it as though its destruction were partly on rewind. Darren Korb's fantastic soundtrack weaves through it all, and its power is such that I still sometimes use it to write to almost four years later."", ""But Bastion remains relevant and fresh largely on account of its narration. As in Blood Meridian, the Kid's travels are narrated by a detached speaker who hangs out at the central hub known as the Bastion, but here, the intonations are less 18th-century New England preacher and more Bourbon Street jazzman. It's all the work of voice actor Logan Cunningham, who adds both weight and the occasional dose of humor to the action, and its power springs from the way it is triggered with almost every action the Kid performs. It's an effect that allows Bastion to transcend simple narration to the point where the Stranger is telling our story as much as the Kid's."", 'When I accidentally send the Kid careening off the edge of the crumbled world with an overzealous dodge, he says, ""And so the Kid fell to his death...just kidding."" When I accidentally send the Kid into pockets of brush so sharp that they could have come from my native South Texas, Logan tells me that they ""hurt as much as a broken heart."" When I use up all my conversation options with him at the Bastion (the place everyone is supposed to run to when things go to hell), he says, ""Sometimes there\'s just not much to say."" There is pain in the world that Supergiant has created, such moments seem to say, but there\'s always cause to crack a smile when things are at their grimmest. And that\'s a good lesson.', 'There\'s a reason that I\'ve saved discussion of the gameplay thus far--it\'s as simple as the rest of the game\'s design, though its aesthetic is complex. The Kid has access to 11 weapons, ranging from a battering ram and ""flame bellows"" to a simple bow and machete, but their use never veers far from the Diablo-style action suggested by its isometric view.', ""But while the combat itself may only consist of typical attacks, blocks, and dodges, there's depth here in the ability to construct buildings at the Bastion. Add a distillery, for instance, and the Kid can unlock perks such as increased critical chance. Toss up a forge, and the Kid can augment the weapons he finds along the way. The limitation of two weapons at any time (along with a related special ability) does allow for some extensive gameplay variations, as you could easily be an in-your-face melee champion or a bow-and-rifle marksman who snipes foes from afar. (And trust me, if you want to survive the ultra-punishing New Game+, you'll probably want to be the latter.) Want a real challenge? Activate the idols, which boost aspects like enemy damage and armor for the reward of more experience and fragments for upgrades at the forge."", ""All of this was just as true back in 2011, and it's a shame that Supergiant didn't at least add a touch more variety. Even so, Bastion holds up remarkably well four years later, even as the acclaimed games of the latter day tend to lose their luster once the initial novelty wears off. At its best, this re-release proves that Bastion is worthy of its name. It's a bastion of good game design and innovative narration, and I suspect that another four years from now, it will hold up just as well.""]"Justin Clark,8-Apr-15,Dark Souls II Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dark-souls-ii-scholar-of-the-first-sin-review/1900-6416092/,9,PC & Xbox One & PS4,"['There was a short run, a tap of R2, and a massive swing of a greatsword, and Aldia, the hideous abomination known as the Scholar of the First Sin, went down in a fiery gust of wind. The fight took five tries. I was still surrounded by phantoms--wild, fearless NPCs who chipped at the Scholar even as they burned alive standing too close. I was draped in the armor of a dead enemy, the Smelter Demon, one of the myriad moments when Dark Souls II threatened to break my spirit in half. I stood in an empty arena while the disembodied spectre of Aldia gave his last lecture on the nature of good and evil.

It's the Souls ethos in a nutshell. There's nothing in that simple statement or any of his later dialogue to suggest that winning or saving this world or its people is a goal or anything to aspire to. It suggests simply that the world of Dark Souls II has a way of digital life that involves sacrifice, hard decisions about the distribution of power, and the fact that seeking more has an iron price. There's no cowardice implied in abandoning hope. It acknowledges power and glory coming at great cost, with no shortcuts or easy roads.

Right before the final notes, he and Fletcher share a silent look. Now you understand."", ""After three games of hitting a wall at the 30-hour mark, Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin eventually stopped screaming at me and started teaching, in the way that every good teacher should: it took away comfort. Every moment that felt safe and familiar from the last outing was infused with danger, with a new enemy, a new reaction to obstacles, a cue to always be ready to face what's around the corner--a constant awareness that doesn't go away the closer you get to the endgame. A dragon awaits you instead of a knight. Where an enemy with the high ground might have shot arrows before, your path is peppered with firebombs. Red phantoms and The Pursuer are now common aggravations, placed just about anywhere you once thought was safe, and occasionally where you were already overwhelmed, just for the extra kick to the teeth."", ""Revisiting older stages at a higher level, and with better gear, very often finds enemies far more hostile and still able to punish arrogance. Remember that merchant you know is in a specific room, that bonfire you just have to kill one more knight to access, that one Chloranthy Ring +2 that would go nicely with that stat-raising shield of yours, that zipline that would shortcut you into a saferoom? They're probably not there anymore. Few of the hardwired safety nets players know of exist, and even experts have no idea just how devious the game can be in doling out hard lessons in pain and frustration by not approaching every situation with the same care as you did the first time."", ""And so, once again, every Dark Souls II player is on equal ground. Every Scholar of the First Sin player is powerless, with returning enthusiasts only able to say that they've seen these massive places once before and that they know how to do battle in them, not that they know what to expect. Their new-game-plus advantages go out the window, a hefty but worthwhile technical price of admission for the complete rearrangement of the game's layout and flow. This goes double for the now-fully integrated Crowns add-ons, with the keys to access no longer magically appearing in inventory, instantly accessible after their respective Primal Flames but hidden in the game's most diabolical locations, which is far more befitting three Herculean tasks now woven into their story the way they're meant to be: as a means to make King Vendrick dispel the Curse of the Undead once and for all."", ""That word's an important one: befitting. During this runthrough, part of the problem I faced after the 30-hour wall was the idea of never feeling the urge to continue because, ultimately, what I was fighting for was so nebulous, the world I was trying to save so oppressive, that it made the task ahead seem all the more futile. Scholar of the First Sin sweetens the pot ever so subtly. The murky, choppy ruin that was its graphical showing in the last-gen had been transformed into 60-fps awe hour after hour, a feeling that the series hadn't been able to inspire previously on consoles, settling at most for impressively desolate. It's an invisible boon, in that precision is even closer within your grasp now that you don't feel the console struggling to catch up to every heavy move you make. Every new environment, even when laid waste by thick clouds of poison, or drowning in lava feels like a place worth surviving in, is a place of intricate details waiting to be noticed. The texture of a shield gleaning in pale sunlight, the reflection of neon plants and sorceress' spells reflecting off the water--these are the details that you find yourself immediately drawn to while you catch a brief moment of respite. Granted, PC players have enjoyed that privilege since the first release, which has improved with each new unofficial mod. For them, this will be an example of added nuance rather than a breathtaking overhaul, but it is an improvement, regardless."", 'The world of Dark Souls II has a way of digital life that involves sacrifice, hard decisions about the distribution of power, and the fact that seeking more has an iron price.', ""Every new item, even a dead boss's soul, armor, or weapon, isn't just a tool with a vague description but now has new bits of story to impart, a bigger piece of this world to engage with, to realize that the story of your Hollowing is unique, just like everyone else's. Aldia, as an NPC, starts literally and metaphorically blowing up on the scene the second Dark Souls II starts getting rather linear, and it's perfect timing: Aldia is there to question your next steps and make the last segment feel like a march to something potentially beyond your understanding, a contrast to the Emerald Herald, whose blind, unyielding hope feels less like simple encouragement but whose directions feel like the strongest chance to do some good. The stream of information, the steady escalation of stakes and intensity, continues, with the knowledge that the inevitable fights with this thing, the mad king, and his wife are coming and that their deaths will only have meaning if you choose it. As opposed to a willfully obtuse collection of setpieces, the Scholar Edition knits in all the disparate parts that came after release, creating a much more organic experience, which is the best feeling to have when separate content is being included with a standalone game. It feels like a whole experience that won't usher you from start to finish like most games, but certainly has a complete, gratifying feel to it."", ""This is all brilliant and bold flesh held together by the tempered adamantium skeleton that is the Souls' series unforgiving combat system, which is still unchanged. It is a game of neverending considerations of risk and reward, questions about what to do with power when given, and will it prepare you for everything, despite the fact that, until the bitter end, nothing, not even the enhancements, will ever mean that you are prepared to do anything but die in Dark Souls. The changes in Scholar of the First Sin show the why. The how remains brutal and intimidating from beginning to end."", ""Three things assuage the fear: one is the knowledge that you are not alone. Through messages, carefully laid hints, and the ability to summon a bigger army to your aid, to gather all the souls possible, versus enemies or other humans, everyone works to slay this beast in his or her own way, and while one often expects the worst of gaming communities, the help and messages of luck vastly outnumber incidents of stupidity. Scholar's addition of an additional enemy on each side makes a world of difference. Every call to protect your covenant, every cooperative boss slaughtering, and every straight-up brawl is less like a tag team match and more like an all-out war. The game experiences its sole jitters here, on occasions of multiple spells crisscrossing the playing field, but the hiccups never last more than a second."", ""The second is the fact that moments come, with time, effort, and drive, when Dark Souls II's hostility gives way to mercy, moments where one's careful considerations are rewarded. Perhaps the greatest new example is the Dragon Aerie and Shrine, where dragon eggs and their mothers are virtually everywhere. Breaking more than three eggs means that every dragon wakes up ready to tear you to shreds, and, in an evil gambit, three eggs block your path inside a cave. But carefully breaking only two of them, just enough to pass, means that every dragon stays peacefully asleep. Later in the Shrine, gold-plated guards new to Scholar of the First Sin now line every major passage. They are completely peaceful as long as you never angered the dragons, which leaves you with only the giant knights to deal with."", ""The third thing that broke me through that wall, after so many deaths and so many hours of hell, was simply realizing the problem was myself. Every gamer has been trained to take from a game that supreme mastery of the world is a given. Enemies want to die. Stories want to be told. Pushing a button meant that everything in my character's line of sight was in danger. Even after the credits roll and the throne is yours (or not), you are never the master of Dark Souls. You survive. You sometimes persevere. But Drangleic will always have it in for you, and rushing into a new area thinking that youre its master is a sure way to find yourself taken down multiple rungs. In being beaten by Dark Souls, I found patience. I found patterns. I found how I wanted to take on the world, and the leveling system was more than happy to oblige my decisions. I found the world itself telling me more of its fascinating secrets the braver I became. As the game became linear, with the three crowns obtained, the souls of dead giants in hand, and the Emerald Herald urging me to slay Nashandra, I found that Dark Souls II had taught me to never over- or underestimate a game world."", ""And it's a hard-won love that Dark Souls II has you earn, a love that took a second, enhanced port to truly find. It is a demanding and seemingly interminable game that puts up its most beautiful and its most evil machinations right at the outset. Its greatest spectacles are the ones that will kill you the fastest. It will taunt. It will demoralize. And yet, it has never done a better job than now of beckoning you on than in Scholar of the First Sin. It will never offer you true power, but those who seek it with enough conviction will at least find satisfaction. That's a feeling that few games offer and few even should. And yet, the exultation of hard-earned victory here, of saying What's next with all the fear, fascination, and excitement of any good, bloody fight, has more joys than most, and even though the game is won, I find myself itching to go back."", 'Dark Souls II, in its final form, is just my tempo.']"Kevin VanOrd,6-Apr-15,Pillars of Eternity Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/pillars-of-eternity-review/1900-6416091/,8,PC,"[""Clone or homage? That Pillars of Eternity hews close to the Baldur's Gate/Icewind Dale formula can't be disputed. Its status within the ranks of its predecessors, however, is less obvious, given how slavishly devoted it is to a time when isometric role-playing games dominated players' imaginations. For all its complexities, Pillars of Eternity walks a narrow path already trod by the genre's greats, including the insurmountable Planescape: Torment and Baldur's Gate II, which rightfully remain atop the computer RPG hierarchy."", 'As much as I can see how blatantly it pokes my nostalgia buttons, I still lost myself in Pillars, which sets itself apart--just enough to tip itself into the ""homage"" bucket rather than the ""clone"" one--with its original fantasy universe, as well as with combat details that reduce frustration and keep the tempo moving. It claws at Planescape and Baldur\'s Gate from beneath their perches, and while it never threatens to replace them, Pillars rises to greatness of its own accord. In those first few hours, however, it relies on nostalgia and familiarity to gain your interest. This isn\'t a Dungeons & Dragons game, but the influence is clear from the moment of character creation, during which you choose a race, a class, and a backstory for your leading man or lady. Old favorites like Elves and Dwarfs are joined by original races like the Godlike, whose elemental head adornments preclude the wearing of hats and helmets; Familiar professions like barbarian and wizard are supported by the cipher, who builds up magical focus by landing attacks with a standard weapon.', ""The world you step into is equally comfortable, using narrative and artistic variations to remind you that this is not, in fact, a place you have visited before. You and your fellow party members--up to six of you journeying at any given time--may equip pistols or arequebuses in addition to swords, rapiers, crossbows, and the like. The soundtrack reliably recalls composer Michael Hoenig's Baldur's Gate music, but the uberdramatic Carmina Burana-esque chants, and the wild woodwind arpeggios you hear during battle, help to differentiate it. You lead your party from an isometric view, navigating forests and meadows populated by wolves, ogres, and bandits, but you also contend with dark spirits and eerie ancient machines that belong only to Pillars."", 'The gods, too, are different in this universe, taking such names as Woedica, Berath, and Magran, and they hold great sway over their followers, who live and die by faith. Pillars of Eternity tells a cautionary tale of the gods\' influence over their worshipers, planting its thematic seeds when your own character becomes a watcher--that is, an individual who can see and interact with disembodied souls. Watchers may also peer into others\' pasts, a skill that reveals some of the game\'s finest tales, which are trapped within specially marked citizens on your map. These tales are optional and self-contained, gleaned by reaching into bystanders\' souls and reliving their memories, but they greatly benefit from developer Obsidian\'s flowery language. There is the tale of the berry-picker who foils a would-be assassin, who ""grabs the figure\'s wrist and falls onto his back, planting a leg in the center of the figure\'s chest."" A story of a small boy hoping to be a wizard\'s apprentice describes the wizards pyrotechnics thusly: ""The mage finishes his show soon after, a giant silver dragon descending through the crowd and a thousand stars exploding into nothingness."" Short, vibrant stories like these paint color into the basic shapes the main plot draws.', 'The games that spawned Pillars of Eternity were wordy, but Obsidian takes narrative density to new heights, dumping heaps of lore onto the table and overwhelming its personal stories with long histories of war replete with fictional words like ""Fonestu"" and ""ferconyg."" The writing is lovely: ""How canst I, so lowly and worn, speak words of proper adulation?"" cries the author of a prayer so aching in its beauty that you might be convinced it is a Biblical psalm. But it\'s easy to lose focus when you\'re drowning in embellishment, particularly when the occasional voiceover highlights the script\'s need for editing. In Pillars of Eternity, characters speak not like people speak, but how writers write: in lengthy sentences that require the merely adequate voice cast to pause for breath multiple times. Voiceover may also begin before you can take in the descriptive stage directions included in dialogue panels--and for that matter, may not accurately reflect the stage directions themselves. (The writing might refer to an emotional state that the voice acting does not convey, for instance.)', ""Ultimately, Pillars of Eternity does not benefit from its inconsistent acting, nor do its characters inspire the same kinds of emotional connections that Dragon Age: Origins does. Nevertheless, I was intrigued by many of their stories, and the Grieving Mother's most of all. This cipher's history was as mysterious to her as it was to me, and as I unveiled her past, I was more and more moved by her devotion to the well-being of infants and their mothers. The game's plot heavily involves the birth of children without souls, empty vessels known as hollowborn. Grieving Mother gives the primary quest a personal touch it desperately needs, just as a personable fighter called Eder provides down-home charm in the midst of rising social distrust."", 'The world you step into is comfortable, using narrative and artistic variations to remind you that this is not, in fact, a place you have visited before.', ""A number of complicated game systems weave their way in and out of this god-filled world. You align yourself with the game's various factions when navigating choice-filled quests, for instance, irritating bloodthirsty druids when you don't take kindly to their sacrificial ways, or supporting a type of soul magic called animancy in spite of the sanitarium's questionable research methods. Pillars of Eternity can't always keep up with its own systems: I ended the game with several quests showing active even when I'd reached failure states, and in two cases, when the quest line inexplicably failed to update when I'd completed assignments, as if the game could not account for the variables I introduced. Yet there's joy in watching the world pulse as a result of your gravity, as if you are directing the social tides. Pillars wraps with a narrated epilogue that nicely condenses the results of your journey. Your decisions, it turns out, have ramifications beyond the game (and, Pillars implies, on a potential sequel)."", ""It is in battle that Pillars of Eternity most excels. When you lead your party into combat, the game pauses (in default settings, anyway), and you pause-and-unpause your way through various tactical decisions, attacking your foes and commanding magic in Baldur's Gate fashion. In time, the chants you hear when battle begins becomes an emotional call to arms, catalyzing your brain into action, and marshaling your fingers into gear. You click from one party member portrait to the next, assigning targets to your paladin, blessing your companions with your priest, and calling for your druid to shoot a bee swarm from her fingers. You've done this before, but Pillars' pleasant interface keeps your attention on the tactics and minimizes the clicks."", ' ', ""It's the endurance system that makes Pillars stand apart from its peers. While you must manage each combatant's health, that's a long-term affair; endurance is the more pressing concern once battle is underway. Taking damage reduces the character's endurance levels, and should he run out, he is out of commission until the battle is over. He is not dead, however, presuming he still has health remaining, though the game is over should your entire party run dry. Odd difficulty spikes could turn the old RPGs into laborious cycles of saving and reloading; Pillars of Eternity's endurance layer keeps you moving forward, sending you back to town only when someone needs sleep, or when you run out of camping supplies that allow you to rest along the way. That doesn't mean that Pillars can't be challenging, or that its tactically deficient. In fact, as the game progresses, you earn more ways of delivering raw damage instead of endurance damage, granting you more methods of weakening, disabling, and ultimately downing your most troublesome foes."", ""You find some of those foes in the ruins beneath Caed Nua, your personal stronghold, which you earn several hours into your adventure. When you're first granted access, the estate is is a ramshackle one, and your keep is notable mainly for its state of disarray. As time passes, however, you may construct more and more improvements, until the library's spiderwebs are dusted away and merchants stand at the ready to sell you their wares. Caed Nua is also a portal to various hands-off activities in which you assign an unused party member to a pending mission, and she returns with a bagful of copper and maybe a few gems or knicknacks. Once you build a barracks, you can even recruit hirelings who defend your keep from hostile wanderers, which is simple enough with the click of a button."", ""The deep dungeon beneath it notwithstanding, the stronghold doesn't add much in the way of meaningful gameplay; it's presence is primarily cosmetic and atmospheric, and its purpose is to reflect your increasing influence. It is a digital snowglobe, meant to be noticed and appreciated, rather than a vital system. As far as audiovisual details go, however, it's a fine one, and Pillars of Eternity occasionally impresses in that regard. One of my favorite touches is such a small one, but it reveals a certain level of care that I greatly appreciate. You earn various cosmetic pets over time, and at one point, I switched out the miniature wurm I preferred to a happy yellow lab. Eder called out to it as we ventured across Brackenbury, and my heart was warmed, knowing that attention was given to this small but elegant touch."", ""Appreciation can turn to distraction when the details don't align, however. This may mean the dialogue misgendering you in a specific conversation, or a missing description when you click on a particular environmental identification icon, even when your party is standing right next to it. Other idiosyncrasies are annoying but easily overlooked, such as the lack of a buyback tab at merchants, which means you have to scroll through all the junk you've unloaded with the seller when browsing his goods. Larger bugs still can crop up, too, however. The biggest one to detract from my playthrough, which caused double-clicking inventory items to remove passive effects, has since been fixed. Labeling problems that cause one-use scrolls to look unavailable even when your lore attribute is well beyond the requirement, however, have not."", ""It's easy to lose sight of those issues when you're lost in a fantasy and captured by a game's rhythms, however, and Pillars of Eternity effortlessly ensnares you, both by reminding you of the places you've been, and by showing you things you didn't expect. It is not changing the future, but it is repackaging the past in a way that deserves praise while falling into a few old traps--and creating a few of its own--along the way. You can easily dodge these traps, however, and emerge victorious in a world where the gods show you both scorn and favor, and it's up to you to hew your own path.""]"Brett Todd,6-Apr-15,MLB 15: The Show Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mlb-15-the-show-review/1900-6416090/,8,PS4,"['Rites of spring come in many forms. Winter snows finally recede. Flying-V formations of geese arc overhead. Opening Day arrives for Major League Baseball. And the latest edition of MLB: The Show arrives to let us know once again how great a sports video game can be.', 'In an unsurprising case of deja vu, Sony has done its usual fantastic job with MLB 15: The Show in the decade-old franchises second release for the PlayStation 4. This is a typically brilliant depiction of the grand old American game that subtly refines the entire experience. It is not groundbreaking, nor a tremendous advancement in sports games, in part because the series has already been to the mountain. This has long been one of the most consistently great sports series of all time, so the refinements are valuable but subtle, like slightly improved pitcher-batter confrontations, new directional hitting mechanics, lifelike crowds, and the distinctive look of shadows as they creep across the field from April through October.', 'Though there are no stop-the-presses moments, MLB 15: The Show remains striking, mostly for its natural feel. This is baseball distilled to its purest form and spiked with just the right amount of big-league glitz, courtesy of the usual modes of exhibition; franchise (now with GM goals, so you can be canned for not getting the job done, and corporate sponsorships, so you can make money for your tight-fisted owner in the process); the always-compelling Road to the Show career simulation; and the revamped Diamond Dynasty option, which is loaded up with new card-collecting frills and annoying microtransactions. Real equipment has been added to the game for the first time this year: Say hello to the corporate thrill of seeing Louisville Slugger emblazoned on bats and gear sets where you buff skills with special Wilson gloves, Nike shoes, a range of real big-league bats, and even ritual good-luck totems. Yes, the role-playing influence is as cheesy as it sounds, but at least Sony has exercised some restraint, so youre not kitting out a third basemen with the Spikes of Speed or a +5 Vorpal Bat.', 'Duels between batters and pitchers are incredibly tense, reflecting real life whether youre familiar with being at the plate or on the rubber yourself, or are a couch potato seasoned from watching games on the tube every summer. Pitchers are smart, able to pick up on weaknesses and make you look like a fool by trailing stuff outside that you can never seem to lay off. At the same time, you can battle effectively, getting your bat on those annoying outside curves and changes so you can at least stay alive to see another pitch.', 'When Im hurling, Im doing everything I can to paint corners and make hitters whiff at stuff in the dirt. When Im hitting, Im all Ted Williams focus, locked so intently on to my TV screen that the house could burn down around me. I lost hours and hours of time as a budding third-baseman phenom in Road to the Show, which is made even more absorbing by the games realistic hitting. Alien abductees have clocked less missing time than I did during the week after MLB 15: The Show was released.', 'Significant changes on the diamond are tough to point out, however. Players now visibly dog it when they mess up at the plate. Swat a nubber back to the mound, and the batter regretfully lumbers down to first amidst a chorus of shouts to run it out, presumably from the first-base coach and the poor lunks in the stands who paid good money to see their heroes go all out at all times. As neat as this can be to watch, visually depicting ballplayers weakly sauntering down the first-base line doesnt significantly affect gameplay, though it adds a couple of ticks to the realism meter (and maybe a couple of ticks to the real-life anger meter about how much big-league stars have lost touch with baseballs roots).', 'Directional hitting produces more of an impact. The default hitting mode now includes the ability to try and send the ball in a particular direction. Simply move the left stick one way to pull, the other way to push, down to keep the ball on the ground, and up to send it into the air when youre looking for a sac. The mechanics are simple enough; Getting them to work is another story. Its difficult to put serious wood on the ball whenever you use the left stick to emphasize the point. This culminated in a spectacularly awful directional batting drill during Road to the Show where I hit three balls out of 20 to the requested zone of the field.', 'Swat a nubber back to the mound, and the batter regretfully lumbers down to first amidst a chorus of shouts to run it out.', 'Fielding has been adjusted so that there are few magic plays where the ball pops into a glove or a player contorts himself in Cirque du Soleil fashion. You can almost always see the ball go right into the glove on grounders, and then see said ball realistically transferred to throwing hand for a laser strike across the infield. This translates into smoother mechanics when youre actually making plays, particularly when it comes to those aforementioned grounders. Fly balls remain a point of contention, however: It continues to be way too easy to get turned around, shuffle your feet, or moonwalk, and turn a routine pop-up into a heart-stopping adventure.', 'Visuals have been enhanced in a number of understated ways. Players look almost photorealistic, to the point where you can readily recognize just about every player in the majors from a distance. There are a few lingering exceptions, however. Jose Reyes beard--ugly at the best of times, anyways--looks like it was daubed on with magic marker. Shaggy hair tends to stand out on players, giving them an anthropomorphic Sonic the Hedgehog look from behind. Eyes can still have a disconcerting popped-up appearance, though you see this more with randomly generated players like the minor-league schlubs than when doing time in AA ball during Road to the Show. Stars like cover-boy Yasiel Puig, Clayton Kershaw, and Jose Bautista dont suffer from this unfortunate fish-eye effect.', 'Animations are almost entirely lifelike, whether youre looking for a realistic flip of the bat after a whiff or a big turn around first when digging in for a double. The only weirdness, again, tends to take place during fly balls. One moment youre lazily settling under a ball, and the next youre sliding back and forth like a zombie extra in Thriller. But for the most part, MLB 15: The Show looks like a real baseball broadcast. This is particularly noticeable between plays, with balls being casually tossed to one another underhand after force-outs. Something so minor doesnt add a ton of value to gameplay, but it certainly adds a lot to the overall experience of playing a complete, lifelike MLB ball game.', 'Stadiums look incredible, with shadows that fall realistically on players shoulders and lengthen across the field as twilight descends on Mudville. Crowds are the best that I have ever encountered in a sports game, and I found myself frequently getting lost in my surroundings when playing a Road to the Show career. I eventually turned off base-running because I was regularly getting picked off as I daydreamed on first, looking around at the busy crowd, amazed at how lifelike the setting was. And not only do the fans look like real individuals, they act like real individuals, too: You observe everything from hardcore nuts waving flags, to bored kids, to a couple consisting of a woman who never stopped talking and a guy who was clearly watching the field and paying no attention to anything she was saying.', 'Crank up a good surround system and you are transported to ground level in a stadium, with cheers, random abuse and encouragement, and comments from other players all punctuated with the whoosh of fastballs giving you chills and the crack of solid hits echoing like gunfire. A new Inside the Show radio report feature has been added to keep you in the know about whats happening across the Majors. It consists of a dry rundown of whos hot, whos not, whos on the trade block, and so on. But it is also heavily detailed and just the sort of added immersion that keeps franchise play more involving. I particularly loved it because it felt old-fashioned, which appealed to the traditional baseball guy inside me who likes nothing better than listening to games on the radio even when I have the option of watching on a big high-definition TV. Matt Vasgersian and his booth crew may be as adrenaline-inducing as warm summer rain, but they provide information and atmosphere by walking the fine line between canned chatter and throwing out numbers.', ' ', 'I should mention the new ability to port saves from MLB 14 into the current game, which has been too long in coming. Also new is Diamond Dynasty mode, although its as fussy as these card-collecting modes of play in sports games tend to be. I was also disconcerted at how Diamond Dynasty emphasizes micropayments. The in-game Stubs currency is too hard to earn through in-game feats. I played for about six straight hours in one of my first play sessions, then dropped out to the menus to fool around with Diamond Dynasty and found that I still hadnt earned enough points to buy even one lousy 1,000-Stub pack of cards.', 'MLB 15: The Show is starting to feel as familiar as that old pair of cleats you throw on every spring for another year of slo-pitch beer ball. That said, baseball is the most hidebound sport on the planet. If real life evolved as fast as the game that Abner Doubleday didnt invent, wed all still be swinging from trees, not for the fences. This slow-and-steady approach to game design makes each iteration of the game comfortable, but it also makes for fantastic baseball sims that you can always count on, and that are always improving in subtle ways. In gaming, in baseball, and in life, thats rare and valuable, even if it does make for a predictable rite of spring.']"Josiah Renaudin,6-Apr-15,Etrian Mystery Dungeon Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/etrian-mystery-dungeon-review/1900-6416089/,7,3DS,"[""Etrian Mystery Dungeon can leave you bullied and brokenhearted. Picture this: after descending dozens of floors and cutting down swathes of virulent enemies, you step on a trap that fills the room with enough feral boars and sharp-toothed wildcats to take out an army. You're ill-prepared, having already exhausted most of your recovery items, so down goes your only medic. You're fresh out of the nectar and Yggdrasil leaves that had kept you on your feet, and somehow you forgot to bring along an escape item to pull you out of this mess. You continually swing your sword, but even the sharpest steel can't cut through such numbers. With a meaty thud, you drop, and away goes the gold, equipment, and items that once stood as trophies of your labor."", ""Within the dungeons, the lows are quite low; no one wants to watch progress vanish into the ether. But surprisingly, the highs manage to outstrip them. Etrian Mystery Dungeon is a punishing RPG that forces you to think before you dungeon crawl, as the penalties for falling in battle or failing to protect your home base can turn your stomach. But once you fully grasp the game's unique loot loop and begin to enter each area with a purpose, the sense of progression is almost too sweet to spurn. With endless customization options and a rich series of quests and randomly generated locations, this sprawling 3DS treat can devour your free time before you even feel the prick of its teeth."", ""You live and die by the dungeon, and there are many to explore. Aslarga--a picturesque town peppered with locations to dine, shop, and report quests--is your base of operations. Splintering off of this hub are dungeonous arteries rich with monsters and loot, and unique in shape and content from dive to dive. Each dungeon's structure is random and unpredictable, but what's certain is the brute sitting at the final floor, waiting to test the skills and equipment you've gathered within the previous locations. Downing the foe unlocks the next story beat, but putting up your blinders and ignoring the action from floor to floor for an early date with a boss isn't just foolish--it's suicide. It can be tempting to rush ahead, but the items and levels gained from scouring the different floors are invaluable, and I often found myself doing multiple runs of previous dungeons before even considering attempting a major battle."", ""So you toil away, digging up materials to sell and armaments to wield. Each step you take reveals a bit more of your current floor's layout, as well as acting as a turn, of sorts. Your steps correspond with those of the monsters inhabiting space in any section of the floor, so when you move, they move. You can position yourself parallel to a creature and bash away at its noggin until it drops, but the hearty suite of unique classes encourages more nuanced, turn-based combat. It's vital to bring along medics, gunmen, and members of your guild who make use of assorted means of attack in order to reach the bottom floor, and taking control of these new tacticians keeps the action varied."", ""Party makeup is critical, but without a solid set of skills, you won't get much done. Each level gained leads to a new skill point, and these can be used to unlock pinpoint sniper shots, a party-wide heal, or even a taunt that draws all enemy attention to a specific ally. Each of the available classes has a deep pool of talents, and every talent's potency can be bolstered with the application of additional points. Thankfully, shared experience--even with guild members absent from the dungeon--allows you to experiment with different combat dynamics. This makes what could have been a painfully tedious system easily manageable. Even if you never use that ninja you recruited early in the game, simply having her wait in the wings allows her to jump up in level and contend during the more difficult challenges."", ""Watching your characters go from clumsy adventurers to lethal tacticians is Etrian Mystery Dungeon's greatest joy. There are numerous interesting ways to build yourself up, from weapons and armor to skills and statistics, and you get a tangible tingle of joy when the total damage numbers that pop off of your targets' heads tick up over time. This makes finding each chest hiding a rare piece of equipment all the more thrilling. The longing for more loot and higher levels only intensifies, and the later dungeons often satiate this thirst."", 'Etrian Mystery Dungeon is a punishing RPG that forces you to think before you dungeon crawl, as the penalties for falling in battle or failing to protect your home base can turn your stomach.', ""It's so disheartening to watch it all fade away. In later dungeons, powerful creatures called DOEs roam the environment. These commanding enemies move from floor to floor, traveling up toward Aslarga as you shift down toward the final segment of a dungeon. Paying to build forts, which lock the dungeon's current layout and harbor up to four members of your guild, is one way of corralling the DOEs. When the enemy crosses the fort's path, it either battles the guild members guarding it or--if the fort is empty--destroys the structure and retreats. If you don't have the gold for construction, though, fighting the DOE is an option, but not a feasible one if your characters aren't properly prepared. Without debuff skills and appropriate statistics, you'll hit the dirt in minutes."", ""If you let the DOE slip by and reach the town, you're ripped from the dungeon, stripped of your spoils, and greeted with a dilapidated Aslarga. More often than not, one of the basic locations--such as the item shop or inn--is left in ruins by the DOE, and if you don't have a fat bank account to foot the bill, it takes time for the structure to be rebuilt. From there, you have to tackle the dungeons with limited, and possibly even empty, funds and leftover equipment you placed in storage."", ""Each dungeon's structure is random and unpredictable, but what's certain is the brute sitting at the final floor."", ""There's a great deal of trial and error, and I can almost guarantee you'll lose your most treasured possessions more than once. These were the times when I was repelled by Etrian Mystery Dungeon's thorny edges, where its learning curve seemed too steep to surmount. But I became savvier to the game's often frustrating peccadilloes over time, and became adept at managing the deepest of dungeons. Keeping the right items, placing forts at the correct intersections, and grinding my party to a sharp edge led to fewer close calls, and even fewer frustrations. Etrian Mystery Dungeon does little to hold your hand, but the early heartbreak acts as an effective lesson in how the game functions."", ""It's a grind, but a welcome one. The process of taking on quests, digging up new items, and returning to town with a fat bag of goods becomes more and more enticing as time goes on. The combat isn't all that action-packed, but the control you have over each member of your party paired with the wide variety of skills at your command produces interesting challenges from room to room. This is a loot hunt, through and through, but there are enough interesting hooks and unique adornments to make what could be simply repetitive consistently fun."", ""If you're looking for a rich story or open world to explore, Etrian Mystery Dungeon isn't your huckleberry. The narrative thread is just strong enough to remain interesting, but it takes a back seat to the loot-soaked foundation that works so well. The different levels of progression take center stage, and if you can overcome the opacity of the systems, the rewards are rich. Etrian Mystery Dungeon's tough outer shell takes time and patience to crack, but cant conceal the treasures stored within.""]"Don Saas,3-Apr-15,Dyscourse Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dyscourse-review/1900-6416088/,7,PC,"[""In the world of Dyscourse, I have a Bachelor of Fine Arts which has taken my career no further than the coffee shop. And while I might be an internationally renowned barista, I don't have the skill set to ensure surviving a plane crash on a remote island. Just a couple months past my 25th birthday, I certainly don't have the life experiences needed to manage a group of mentally unraveling survivors. But that's where the no-longer-proverbial tailspin of life has jettisoned me. I hold not only my survival in my hands as I fend off starvation, dehydration, wild animals, and the basest human survival instincts; I've become responsible for five other lost souls, and I don't know if I can handle this responsibility."", ""It's raining, and we've been on this island for three days now. Teddy makes me uncomfortable. His paranoid delusions get worse every day. He's convinced that Garrett--the chubby, sad, and lonely gamer--conspired with the government to crash our plane. He insists that we build a signal to escape the island, but we have to take care of food and water first. We found water yesterday, but in his excitement, Garrett found himself covered in leeches, and he ran into a rock as he tore the bloodsuckers from his body. It will be a while before I forget the image of those parasites squirming on his body. But now, he won't stop babbling incoherently. He seems to think he's in a massively multiplayer game. I hope he isn't concussed."", ""And Steve nearly died today. I think on some level he wanted to. His cigarette lit the jet fuel around the fuselage, and if he hadn't jumped at the last second, the rain would have put his fire out, but lightning struck the exact spot where he'd been standing. Steve looks like he needs a hug, though I wish he would stop pouting and do something productive. Not that Louise was any more helpful. I don't know where we'd be if it weren't for her husband, George. I think he's the only sane person left--besides me. Maybe I'll talk to him tonight before we go to bed. Well...we'll talk if our shelter at the beach holds up. This storm is getting bad."", ""That is just one of many stories that unfold in survival-adventure game Dyscourse. Imagine Lost as a cartoon in which Jack was a girl and all of the psychological issues of everyone else on the island were amplified to eleven, and you'll get a feel for the tone and style of Dyscourse. After crash landing on a remote island, you play as Rita--a girl whose personality and leadership style you're free to shape however you choose--and it's up to you to lead you and your fellow survivors to rescue...if you can avoid being eaten by jaguars or dying of hunger first."", 'Dyscourse is a game about choice and light environmental exploration. Although you\'re free to roam the island and engage in a handful of basic adventure-game staples--finding tools, solving simple puzzles--Dyscourse\'s best moments are of the ""choose your own adventure"" kind. For anyone frustrated by many of the false choices in Telltale\'s Walking Dead series, Dyscourse takes branching paths to nearly ludicrous lengths--though enough playthroughs will reveal the limitations of even this game\'s systems. You make difficult decisions at every turn. Do you search for water, or food? Do you rescue the flares that could signal rescue, or save a beloved survivor\'s life? Do you try to save a woman attacked by jaguars, or let her die to ensure your own survival? Dyscourse lets the consequences range from immediately apparent to long-term mercies and cruelties. The endings are limited to three major scenarios, but the details surrounding them feel nearly infinite.', ""Beyond offering consistently anxiety-riddled conundrums for how you live on this island, Dyscourse succeeds on the back of charming and clever writing. Although every Dyscourse playthrough invariably takes a turn towards darkness--particularly the one where I intentionally made the worst decisions I could--the game's style is lighter than most survival fare, and I lost track of the number of times when the game made me laugh out loud. Although all the characters but Rita and kindly farmer George seem irreparably broken, you grow to care about your troupe of island-dwellers through the sincerity of the game's writing. It's unfortunate that Dyscourse takes cheap shots at Teddy's clear schizophrenia and plays it for the wrong sorts of laughs."", ""The game's storybook visuals, where characters and environments feel like they were lifted from a felt-crafted stop-motion cartoon, may not initially appeal to you, but they work well within their context. In one playthrough, a character had his arm ripped off by a jaguar, and anything resembling realism would have destroyed the tone. The moment made me audibly gasp, and the severity of the game's situation hit home very quickly, but it wasn't unnecessarily and graphically violent."", ""Dyscourse's writing and sense of place is so strong that when the game ends as suddenly as it does, it's natural to want even more. Any individual playthrough shouldn't take more than an hour or so. And though the game offers you many options on how to play, there's little reason to return after having seen all three major endings because you'll learn how to game the system to your favor...though in Dyscourse's defense, I never had a successful playthrough in which every survivors was rescued. My best playthrough still experienced two casualties."", ""Dyscourse has charm and personality to spare, and though you can peel back the layers of its systems if you spend enough time replaying it, few games make your choices feel as meaningful and impactful as this one does. Throw in an excellent musical score, and it's not difficult to mark it as one of the most aesthetically pleasing titles of 2015 thus far. It's rare that I would want to spend more time on a desert island, but Dyscourse left me craving slightly more of those agonizing days and nights.""]"Austin Walker,3-Apr-15,Three Fourths Home Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/three-fourths-home-extended-edition-review/1900-6416087/,8,PC,"[""I can barely hear my car's radio over the storm. It's just a low buzz and a series of rhythmic thumps. I'm alone on the highway, flanked by rows of Nebraskan corn, driving in the shadow of the wind turbines in the distance, steadily spinning along in the rain. Dozens of wind turbines... or hundreds of them. Thousands maybe? They seem to stretch forever--or for at least as long as this awkward conversation with my father does."", ""Three Fourths Home is a short piece of interactive fiction that captures the feeling of late-night driving and millennial uncertainty. You play as Kelly Meyers, a 20-something who recently moved back in with her folks and who can't see a path forward for her or her troubled family. As the player, you're more concerned with the family's past: Across a main story, an epilogue, and a collection of interesting bonus content, you piece together (and even decide) who these people are and what happened to them."", ""Like all stressful conversations, there's no walking away from this one. You have to push through it."", ""In the game's main story, you spend about an hour driving through an intense storm while talking with your family members on the phone. On a screen of stark (and occasionally overwhelming) black, white, and gray, you pass through rural Nebraska while choosing dialogue options and taking in the scenery. You hold down the D key to drive forward while selecting dialogue with the up and down arrows. With a press of the F key, the camera zooms in to the silhouette of your car, and your speed shakes the screen. You can mess with your tape deck or flick your headlights on and off, but these mostly serve to occupy your hands (and take up your nervous energy). If it all sounds simple, it's because it is. But it's also effective."", ""Three Fourths Home again proves that interactive fiction can feel urgent, and it's a reminder that game makers working in the genre have more tools at their disposal than just their words. The droning ambient sounds and the high-contrast zine aesthetic create a tense atmosphere, and the game's control scheme supports this. In order to progress through conversations you need to continue to drive forward. The second you let go of that D key, everything decelerates into slow motion--the rain, the windmills, the bird that flies overhead--and your dialogue options vanish. Like all stressful conversations, there's no walking away from this one. You have to push through it, and you must do so with care: It's all too easy to choose the default response during conversation when you mean only to forward a conversation, due to the game's measured reveal of possible replies."", 'The droning ambient sounds and the high-contrast zine aesthetic create a tense atmosphere.', ""Of course, writer Zach Sanford's words contribute to the tension, too. Though much of the dialogue is humorous, the conversations you have with Kelly's mother, father, and brother always work their way back around to some recent trauma--yours or theirs. Games have a history of mishandling the traumatic, but Sanford manages to explore these ideas with restraint and insight. His natural writing sets Three Fourths Home apart from many other games which render personal suffering cartoonish. The Meyers, like real people, are careful but flawed. They know that there are topics you can only really talk about when you can look someone in the eye. But they can't quite manage their desires to talk about the tough stuff. So they hint at their pasts, talk around their personal tragedies, and occasionally brush close to their painful memories."", 'The game\'s epilogue subverts this structure. Still playing as Kelly, you are taken back into her memory of a time months before the main game\'s story. But unlike a linear flashback, this is memory reflects the doubt and regret that often comes with hindsight. You can choose to make the same dialogue choices that Kelly made all those months ago, or you can linger on the ""what ifs."" What if she had told her mother about her problems? What if she\'d worked harder in school? What if she\'d taken a different bus that day? You\'re not actually seeing alternate outcomes--you\'re just obsessing over them the way we all do.', ""The conversations you have with Kelly's mother, father, and brother always work their way back around to some recent trauma--yours or theirs."", ""The extras included in Three Fourths Home build on this. On top of being able to listen to the game's soundtrack, you're able to flip through one of Kelly's college photography projects and read a collection of her brother's short stories. The photos are flawed and the fiction flirts with cliche, but both are better for it. Central to Three Fourths Home is the notion that creative work helps us work through our trauma, and being able to see the art these characters made sells that. Since so much of Three Fourths Home is about understanding who these people are, this stuff isn't superficial bonus content. It's a true part of the experience."", ""In total, that whole experience only took about two hours of my day. But it left me winded. There is a real velocity to Three Fourths Home. It sneaks up on you, quietly at first, before suddenly becoming overwhelming. Its closest analogs aren't other games, but works like John Darnielle's novel Wolf in White Van or the haunting music of lo-fi artist Mount Eerie--art that rumbles and groans and then springs into action."", ""More than anything, though, Three Fourths Home reminded me of one of those nights where you look down to see that you're going ten... twenty... thirty miles over the speed limit. But you just can't bring yourself to lift your foot off the gas pedal.

Once we discover something, we can never discover it again even if we start over. A world fully revealed is suddenly a more static place than when it started. It's at this nexus point between the potential and the static that Failbetter's Sunless Sea finds itself in. Though it sports an immensely imaginative setting and fantastic writing, Sunless Sea's roguelike-inspired elements don't quite gel with the longform exploration you're meant to embark on."", ""Built in the mold of such games as Sid Meier's Pirates and Koei's Uncharted Waters series, Sunless Sea sets you loose on The Unterzee with a simple ship, a crew, some supplies, and a blank sea chart that slowly fills in as you explore the zee. That last bit is crucial to understanding where Sunless Sea's heart lies, as your primary instinct in this game will almost always be to sail for the black spots to see what's there. Your reward? A cavalcade of islands and shoreline settlements, each with their own secrets and stories to tell, which takes the form of expertly-written text which occasionally lets you choose how you react to what you find. If you can imagine The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker was a visual novel with resource management set in a series of twisted British colonies, you'd be in the ballpark of describing the bulk of the Sunless Sea experience."", ""Of course, it's the intriguing setting that makes you want to explore in the first place. The Unterzee itself is a strange, scary place that combines the unknowable dread of the works of Lovecraft with the diverse, normalized weirdness of Dungeons and Dragons' Planescape setting. London has sunk underneath the Earth's crust and serves as the principal port for the varied inhabitants and societies of the ocean below. Hell is real, and it just had a revolution to exile its aristocracy. Ships have the option of going to the surface, where human society still thrives, but their crews risk exposure from the sun, which can be deadly for inhabitants of the Unterzee (most of whom appear to be human themselves). Three mysterious, powerful beings are worshiped as gods of the zee--Stone, Salt, and Storm--but their influence is so vague and cryptic that you may not even know they're acting. Indeed, should you ever find yourself stranded without food or fuel, you can pray to one of them to give you a boon to tide you over until you make port. That doesn't mean they'll actually answer, mind. Or if they will even be kind rather than cruel. Even positive responses can be treacherous, as praying to Stone for fuel has been known to drop stalactites of coal from the ceiling, crushing crew members in the process. The rich, nuanced backdrop that the Unterzee provides is just begging players to explore its darkest corners."", ""The real terror underneath this backdrop, though, is an elegant resource management game clashing against your desire to press your luck by pressing into the unknown further and further from London. Fuel and supplies are of extreme importance because if one of them depletes, it's game over. You'll also have to manage a third resource: terror. As you sail, you crew will get progressively more nervous about sailing the weird, treacherous waters. And the further you move from London, the quicker it will increase. Other actions you take in the text portions of the game will also increase or decrease this value. Should it ever hit 100, your crew will try to mutiny and will kill you if you don't calm them down. Returning to London will reset this value to 50 if you're already higher than that, encouraging you to return home every so often. Managing all three of these variables creates a nice tension during your voyage and really informs how far you want to venture out during each trek. And there's nothing like realizing you planned poorly for a voyage as you quickly scurry home, barely making it before your fuel bottoms out."", 'But the big payoff in Sunless Sea is in the exploration. While you\'re scouring the zee and wiping out the black little by little from your sea chart, you\'ll often stumble across islands with ports you can stop at. Each one treats you to several different visual novel-like scenarios, many of which are tied to quests that grant echoes (the game\'s currency), fuel, supplies, or even different kinds of valuable artifacts or other assorted kinds of unknowable knowledge represented as items. The islands themselves all have their own stories to tell, and you\'ll feel compelled to unravel each and every one. And though it\'s thrilling to find out how all of these stories connect and intersect, the best by far are the ones that tell the stories of the societies themselves. One island, Visage, forces you to wear an animal mask and play the part it suggests while you\'re in the city proper--a frog mask indicates a bumbling tourist type. Playing your part correctly is more important than being polite or not being disruptive. Frog masks who aren\'t clumsy and thoughtless are immediately booted from the island. In this way, Visage speaks volumes about social interaction as performance and its role in determining identity. Another island, the Empire of Hands, is cultural appropriation taken to the extreme. It\'s made up of sentient apes obsessed with obtaining souls of their own so they can ""uplift"" themselves and take their places as humans\' equals, even mimicking a melange of other cultures\' structures and practices. Thing is, there\'s really no evidence that taking souls actually works, so it may just literally be a case of ""monkey see, monkey do."" Not all of the islands offer such fleshed-out cultures, but those that do isolate different aspects of our own culture and put them under a microscope.', ""These transcendent moments inevitably fade, however, when you begin to grapple with the game's recursive structure. Dying doesn't end your journey, but rather initiates the beginning of a new captain's. You essentially start over with a new character, though you do get to carry over a portion of your previous captain's stats provided they were high enough as well as half of their Echoes, an officer, or their entire revealed seachart. And if you don't accept the latter, all the islands outside of the starting area are randomized and placed in completely different positions, forcing you to find them again. In this way, your journeys form a seafaring lineage of sorts equipped with the knowledge of past triumphs and mistakes, giving the game's structure a roguelike feel with a slight cushion whenever you bite the big one. The problem is this structure is a mismatch for Sunless Sea's slow pace. Exploring the zee is a very methodical process as you watch your ship slowly slide along the dark green water like a slug. Many quests involve you taking one or several doodads from one island to another, further limiting feelings of progression."", ""And then there's the game's possible victory conditions, which crib from strategy games like Civilization without taking into account how quickly progression scales in them. You can go to zee for the joy of discovery and experience all you can so you can write your masterpiece, but you're put in an awkward position no matter how you position your new captain. If you start with a blank map, you'll have to spend each new start building up your resources again near home waters, which is time-consuming and monotonous. If you utilize a previous map, however, you don't get any new fragments--essentially experience--for landmarks you already discovered, which hamstrings progress towards meeting the prerequisites for victory. You need to cash in a large amount of secrets here (which let you level up stats, but also serve as a resource), which is awkward because you get a secret every time you get a certain amount of fragments and relying on a revealed map means not getting very many in that playthrough. Rather than creating interesting tension, these two scenarios just exacerbate the game's slow pace to intolerable levels. You can also win by acquiring a lot of money, but this victory condition sidesteps the most interesting parts of the game, instead pushing you to either care about finding the most profitable trade routes or find an exploitable, repeatable way to make some easy scratch. Finding your father's bones, which is the other victory condition, is by far the sanest way to experience Sunless Sea, which gives you a tangible main quest while also giving you the freedom to explore the Unterzee at your leisure."", ""Which brings us to the fatal flaw in the game's structure: the diminishing returns inevitably associated with exploration. In roguelikes, the procedurally-generated dungeons ensure that you'll always have a different experience each time you play through the game, but the reason for that was as an ultimate test of mastery. You play until you die, learn from your mistakes, and then try to get further based on your personal growth. Sunless Sea tries to do a similar thing by mixing up the islands every time you die. Each playthrough will feature different discoveries at different times, often mixing up the order you visited them last time in the interest of keeping the world from that inevitable state of being static. The problem is that the content of the islands themselves never changes. Sure, you can pick different options when the game lets you, but for the most part, everything that happens on the islands is the same as before. You're not really dealing with an uncertain, dynamic ocean voyage so much as you're living in a salty version of Groundhog Day where you have very little agency to change things. And though permadeath can be turned off in the settings, the game still encourages you to play many different captains so that you can reset all the quests and reap more rewards as you go when all you want to do is unravel the game's secrets you haven't yet discovered."", ""Sunless Sea is an ambitious work that attempts to capture the sheer kinetic thrill of discovery in a bottle without the inevitable entropy of player completion depleting it, and falls well short. The promise of lengthened replayability only makes the methodical pace a joyless grind at times. But the things you're meant to discover truly defines the best of Sunless Sea. The stories you'll be able to tell from your journeys--that time you helped those rat mechanics defeat a bunch of guinea pig nobles; the creepy place you found yourself after sailing off the edge of the map; your continued struggles with managing your cannibalism--truly makes Sunless Sea a voyage worth taking for those with the patience to deal with the litany of structural issues. In asking how games can tap into our desire to discover, Sunless Sea proves that what we discover matters at least as much as how much we can discover.""]"Daniel Starkey,31-Mar-15,Worlds of Magic Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/worlds-of-magic-review/1900-6416080/,2,PC,"['After years of constant warfare, my orcish hordes were on the precipice of victory. Countless nations fell beneath the tread of their boots as they subjugated all manner of fantastical races. In their quest to conquer the unhallowed--an evil empire of the dead--the orcs had brought every mountain and every shore under their control. They had harvested every crop, mined every ore, and collected every artifact they found on their campaign. Yet, something was missing: despite being at the height of their power, these orcs had become wracked with boredom', ""Despite the fantastical premise, Worlds of Magic commits too many cardinal sins to count. As a game of fanciful wizards and creatures, you'd expect it to be vibrant and alluring. Instead, its landscapes wholly lack imagination. The excitement of battle is ground to excruciating tedium, buried under mindless tasks and micromanagement. Worlds of Magic can't even claim a decent feeling of progression or power escalation--a key piece of any proper 4X strategy game--to drive engagement. The result is a tepid melange of half-baked ideas and pointless hindrances."", ""Worlds of Magic begins, as these affairs so often do, with you selecting a civilization to lead to victory. The choices seem diverse enough. Standard humans, elves, orcs, and dwarves are there, as well as dragon people, insects, and the undead legions. The potential breadth of play styles should be a great platform upon which to build a game, but here it just isn't. Except for the unhallowed, none of these races has anything unique about how it plays. No matter whom you pick, the similarities are too obvious, slashing potential replayability and depth."", ""After picking your race, you select a sorcerer lord to lead your armies. You may choose a pre-built one with specialized traits, or you can create your own and customize him a bit, though either way, your choices lack impact or import. I, for example, chose as my first leader R'jak, a powerful lich. By his description, he should be a powerful undead monstrosity with an abject hatred for everything living. In play, he's like any other leader, custom or not: He has a few spells that do a little damage, and a few more with minor utility. The problem here is twofold. Firstly, leader choice is disconnected from race selection, so it's weird but possible to have an army of normal humans led by an undead warlock. Secondly, many of the sorcerer lords have plenty of overlapping spells, again diminishing the effect of picking any one for his specific powers or abilities and robbing him of any uniqueness. Instead of playing the strengths of the undead against R'jak, they each need to be able to function independently for the sake of balance. That leaves either choice without any personality of its own."", ""Most of your time with Worlds of Magic is spent managing resources, building up your armies, and conquering. In an ideal world, these separate systems would work together to create new opportunities for players to flex their tactical muscles. At every conceivable turn, however, Worlds of Magic finds a way to strip every intricate layer strategy game designers have implemented over decades' worth of genre evolution."", ""Cities are at the heart of Worlds of Magic. They are your only means of border expansion, production, and resource generation. Cities are also the source of most of the problems. In a normal 4X game, cities are somewhat malleable. You found them, build a few structures or improvements nearby, and tailor them to what you need at any given point. Worlds of Magic doesn't permit such flexibility, however. You still found cities wherever you please, but their borders never expand, you can't construct any tile improvements, and you can't micromanage any piece of them beyond how many citizens are dedicated to food, production, or research. City buildings also follow a complex unlock tree that require you to build too many structures that don't relate to your chosen focus. It is feasible, for example, to build a city near a rare resource and then push a city towards economic output. Doing so, however, requires that you build structures that offer no benefit beyond unlocking buildings that you need, making them effective dead weight."", ""This also only serves to highlight another of the game's fundamental flaws: There's no associated cost with having dozens or even hundreds of settlements. Your citizens build up a degree of unhappiness, but it's a local issue and not tied into a single global resource, like happiness, that you need to manage. Moreover, if you don't maintain positive food and gold income at all times, your units begin to disband and your buildings are decommissioned. Since cities usually generate positive income, and since the number of municipalities you control is your sole production cap, the whole system forms a disastrous feedback loop. You build more cities so you can build more settlers so you can build more cities. In each of those new towns, you erect the same buildings and manage them in the same way. This is one of the only consistently viable ways to win, but it also means burdening yourself with tons of repetitive work wholly devoid of actual strategizing."", ""I found myself wanting to quit games not because I didn't have the ability to win, but because it had become a chore to manage it all. What's worse is that tedious management is so critical in the early game, it was common for me to skip 50 turns or more just waiting for my population to build up. That's not OK: It's grinding without any tangible reward. Most turns should somehow require your attention so that you are engaged and invested. Tellingly, I made a macro to auto-skip turns while I walked off to go make myself dinner. And again, I stress this is the most successful strategy in Worlds of Magic, by far. The other main option is to build units and construct buildings early on, but the upkeep cripples your resource production, making you decommission units you just ordered. The whole thing is an absolute mess."", ""In what must have been an attempt to make these worlds seem denser and more interesting, the land is dotted with swarms of high-level monsters. They don't spew forth and attack you, but they're intended to be among the first things you find on any given map. They often have valuable treasure or can net you a powerful monster of your own. Because they are so well-guarded, you can't do anything with them until the mid-to-late game, so they sit there, taking up space. Your only other opponents are AI-controlled races and countries. Given that there are at most seven of them scattered across several planes which, in turn, can only be accessed via special portals containing the same high-level monsters, there's nothing to do in the early game. Over time, your units get stronger and you get better, but for that to be satisfying, you need an idea of your early limitations. Worlds of Magic trades that for a mad rush to the late game so you can do anything of note, and problematically, those late-game units need more gold and food for upkeep, reinforcing the city grind."", ""An alleged selling point of Worlds of Magic is its tactical battle system. Should two opposing units meet, you jump into a turn-based tactical mode to maneuver your troops around. Battles are functional, but together, the tactical system and strategic one kill Worlds of Magic's pace. It's nice to defend a city against an attack with only a handful of troops and some clever positioning, but tactical battles require you to take five or ten minutes away from a game already bogged down by the worst kind of micromanagement. There is an auto-resolve feature that helps with the monotony, but it does a poor job of actually mimicking the results you would expect to see should you manage these battles on your own. In my testing, I found that even when I had many more units of ranks far higher than my enemy's, I would often inexplicably lose fights. Granted, choosing auto-resolve means playing the percentages, but when two basic enemy soldiers defeat five or ten veterans, there's a problem."", ""Worlds of Magic doesn't just have issues with its strategy mechanics, either. It suffers from an array of bugs, glitches, and crashes, and its frequent texture pop-in makes it an absolute eyesore. During some of the tactical sections, maps fail to load entirely. On at least four occasions, my computer locked up and I had to restart the machine. Countless tiny bugs can also cause certain attacks to miss, actions to not work, and the user interface to become completely unresponsive."", ' ', ""I could forgive some, though not all, of these issues if Worlds of Magic had something intriguing to show. Part of the appeal of fantasy worlds and settings is that they show you the special, the unreal. Worlds of Magic only ever offers the mundane. In Worlds of Magic, there are several magical races strewn across disparate worlds, each with its own governing element. The leaders of these races are powerful wizards that bring world-buckling sorts of magic to bear on their foes. These sorcerers are a force unto themselves, and they dominate everything. The premise plants the proper seeds for an enchanting adventure, but Worlds of Magic doesn't cultivate them. As one of these grand wizards, your spells are feeble at best, and every plane--no matter the element--features similar mountains, oceans, and other topological features. Yes, the shadow plane uses tar pits instead of water, but that's nothing more than a palette swap. In contrast, Warlock and Warlock 2 have the same structure and purpose as Worlds of Magic, but they are executed with far more skill. Warlock's plane of life has tiles that heal you and weaken the undead. The plane of fire has dozens of volcanoes and lava that have real effects on how you play. Your spells, too, can reshape vast swaths of land, raising valleys or wiping away mountains. In that series, there exists a sense of agency that unfolds as you explore the bizarre settings."", 'Worlds of Magic has none of that mystery. Its fantasy world is undercut by bland artistic direction and a lack of conviction. Choices about your leader and civilization that should matter lack weight in favor of same-ish armies and leaders that blend together. Grand-scale strategy that should make any player feel powerful, or at the least clever, gives way to the dullest slog. Worlds of Magic tries to mimic the cleverness of its superiors, but reaches far beyond its ability to perform.']"Josiah Renaudin,31-Mar-15,Story of Seasons Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/story-of-seasons-review/1900-6416085/,7,3DS,"[' Farm work often builds more calluses than character. Baling hay and operating heavy machinery under the suns stare isnt what Id call fun, as even my few high school summers spent helping a farmstead to flourish had me pining for the comfort of a cubicle. Its wearisome work, but as Story of Seasons proves, it also has its grand rewards. Watching a field of seedlings transform to a sea of stalksalong with raising a calf to not only produce milk, but also show well in competitioncan be worth the hours of tilling, watering, feeding, and grooming. ', 'The fruit of your labor is yours to ripen, but it takes time and patience to see your farm in Story of Seasonsa Harvest Moon game in everything but nameprogress beyond a small patch of unripe tomatoes. Tilling dirt, planting seeds, spreading fertilizer, keeping your animals happy and healthythe list of chores is long (and yes, these are chores.) You wont gleefully rush to brush your two rabbits and water your spinach crop before the days end, but youll still push through these menial tasks for the good of the farm. The products that come from the processes drive you to action, and while these procedures are often tedious, the payoff of your hard work is too rich a bounty to resist. ', 'When youre first planted into town, theres actually very little to do. As a new farmer looking to sell your goods and attract fresh business, your customizable character (who can be either male or female) has very few tools and tokens to work with. Youre given a ramshackle dwelling stationed on an unkempt plot of land, as well as an assortment of equipment with rugged grips and dull edges. Its from this unremarkable cocoon you must emerge, and while the compulsion to create proper plots for crops and to tidy up this agricultural mess is strong, making any real progress takes time. Your first few weeks feel empty, and at times even aimless, since you dont have the means to accomplish much. ', 'Its not just your budding flowers, fruits, and grains that determine the pace. Its your characters insufficient stamina that drives activity, and while cooking the various purchasable recipes and ordering an entree at the local restaurant gives you a healthy boost of energy, the consistent burden of running out of juice is wearisome. Every swing of the axe, thrust of the hammer, or flick of the wrist as you water crops affects your stamina, and thats a nagging, momentum-killing issue early on. Without the proper funds or food (or if its a Wednesday and the restaurants closed), you can easily wind up with depleted strength before noon. After that, youre left to either socialize with your neighbors or sleep the day away to fully restore your energy. Story of Seasons biggest flaw is its insistence on too literally conveying the world-weary axiom, There just arent enough hours in the day. ', 'The fruit of your labor is yours to ripen, but it takes time and patience to see your farm in Story of Seasons progress beyond a small patch of unripe tomatoes.', 'You learn to work within these tight boundaries. After watering your crops and tending to your livestock Monday morning, maybe youll spend the next three hours fishingan activity easy on your staminawith the hopes of nabbing a rare catch. If it rains on Tuesday and you dont need to manually water plants (an occurrence youll cherish), you can spend the morning selling crops to the merchant visiting the market. From there, you can allot your waning hours of sunlight to chopping down trees to free up additional space for barns, or working the land for all those sweet potato seeds taking up space in your inventory. Once you discover valuable minerals like copper and purchase enough blueprints for new tools, though, the stamina restrictions loosen. By the time I crafted a gold brush and watering can, I was able to attend to almost every errand in a given day without depleting my food bank or splurging at the restaurant. ', 'Unfortunately, digging up dirt and picking up stray branches isnt fun. In fact, gathering materials and making sure everything on your farm is in tip-top shape before you hit the hay can be an lifeless grind. But even after spending three in-game days doing little more than watering plants and milking cows whilst waiting for a merchant to come to town, the compulsion to continue expanding my empire was strong. After playing a marathon session and with every intention of putting the 3DS down, simply waking up to the pitter-patter of rain against my roof was enough to get me out of my virtual bed and back into the fields. Story of Seasons intelligently doles out new tasks and items that build upon its basic farming mechanics, so its easy to just barrel through weeks at a time in anticipation for bigger and better results. ', 'The deliberately paced farm work coupled with the time between planting crops and seeing results only makes cashing in your trove of goods sweeter. A calendar tells which days of the week merchants come into town, and the more you sell, the more unique buyers visit the market. Different items are also in-demand during certain weeks and with particular buyers, so while you might have moaned and groaned as you slaved over dozens of different plants, selling an entire crop of chili peppers at above-market value can turn the whole game around. This sudden influx of cash allows you to lease new land, buy more cows, or even expand your house. ', 'Thats when Story of Seasons is at its best. After spending weeks digging through your couch cushions for enough loose change to simply feed your cows, finally selling your goods and using this influx of money to upgrade each aspect of your agricultural business is wonderfully satisfying. The subsidiary activities, such as fishing, decorating, and (eventually) mining for rare minerals can be entertaining on their own, but they all feed into Story of Seasons primary goalto build the biggest, best farm possible. ', 'Every swing of the axe, thrust of the hammer, or flick of the wrist as you water crops affects your stamina.', 'Because of how single-minded you can become, its difficult to find entertainment outside of the farm. Poking the townsfolk to hear repetitive dialogue is dull, and the planned events that range from cooking competitions to fashion shows feel more like roadblocks during your daily routine than novel ways to interact with your neighbors. Different events through each of the four seasons do well to break up the pace, but every moment youre not farming can feel like a waste of effort. ', 'One nagging distraction is the frame rate, which noticeably dips as you travel from screen to screen. Story of Seasons isnt a visual powerhouse, even if the cartoony characters and vibrant colors of the different seasons are nice to look at. But as soon as you step into a patch of land littered with seeds and budding plants, the presentation stutters. It doesnt prevent you from completing any specific tasks, but the frame rate remains a consistent nuisance. ', 'Even so, Story of Seasons is a wildly addictive, bizarrely rewarding adventure constrained by tight restrictions that only loosen after a significant time investment. The early pacing problems do well to bolster the sense of progression later in the game, and while the restrictive stamina system tempers the fun early on, the eventual payoff for all your hard work is enhanced by the early days spent toiling in the fields. There are blatant issuessome of which might keep you from advancing beyond the first seasonbut once Story of Seasons has its hooks in you, its difficult to walk away from the farm.']"Nick Capozzoli,30-Mar-15,Sid Meier's Starships Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sid-meier-s-starships-review/1900-6416082/,4,PC,"['""This would be good as a mobile game"" was, historically, some pretty faint praise. A sort of euphemism for alleging that a game was baser somehow, that in exchange for a shallow, compulsive high it asked little of a player save the odd microtransaction. Drag a distracted finger across a screen a few times, and kill, conquer, level up...all between stops on the train. I don\'t cotton to those implications, not anymore: Mobile games have achieved too much, broken too many molds. But in some circles you can still hear the old backhanded compliment being leveled at games like Sid Meier\'s Starships.', 'Starships happens to actually be a mobile game--the kind that harks to those days of yore, when ""mobile"" equated to ""simplistic."" It released simultaneously on PC, Mac, and iPad, and in more-or-less the same form to boot. And the first things you notice about it are the various ways it seems visually bottlenecked by its tablet version. On PC, it unfurls in a tablet\'s compacted, low resolution window, and there are no graphical settings to massage. Its sci-fi galaxy is mostly abstracted, and its unit models are simple and blocky. It\'s not those issues that really put me off of Starships, but rather the way it seems to aspire to that narrow, dated idea of what makes a ""good"" mobile game. I can turn aside the quick and obvious assaults on PC sensibilities--the rough graphics, the lack of options--but it\'s the cynical design that guts me, in the end.', ""The titular starships form a single roving fleet on the game's galactic map, and act as the lone controllable unit. From your home base, the fleet can be moved over to any adjacent planet with the press of a button, which triggers combat missions that award points towards bringing the planet into the fold of your empire. Planets under your control confer resources each turn (food, industrial production, science, and energy) that can be spent on upgrades for your starships, or used towards buildings and world wonders that improve your production or military capabilities. The salient goal is to have a majority of the galaxy under your thumb--51%, and no less."", ""Where Meier's Civilization series accommodates pacifism, there isn't much to do with your Starships fleet on the galactic map except pick fights. There are victory conditions outside of conquering your opponents, sure--controlling X amount of world wonders or researching Y amount of technologies--but these goals take resources to complete, and the only way to fill your storehouses is to perform combat missions and claim planets. The different victories have different names, but they all boil down to exercising military might, which in turn requires trudging through watered down and grossly exploitable battles."", ""Combat missions set your ships down on a honeycomb game space surrounding a planet. You might be asked to escort a unit (that, mercifully, you also control), or hunt down an escorted one yourself. Or you navigate a maze of asteroids to reach an escape gate, or defeat an enemy boss. The asteroids strewn about the playing field block fire, and black holes teleport ships to other black holes on the map. It's simplistic board game strategy propped up by only the barest of fiction, and eminently exploitable. Every one of your ships can be upgraded to deploy zippy, surprisingly powerful fighters, meaning that in a single turn it's possible to effectively double the size of your fleet. The fighters are fragile, but they're so strong and can quickly cover so much distance that they throw the balance of any fight. Even forgoing them, I found I was able to comfortably win almost every engagement on any difficulty level by committing to longer range lasers and picking off enemies as they tried to approach, one at a time. It's a strategy game without strategy, enabling you to sleepwalk your way to triumph."", 'Starships ostensibly picks things up where Civilization: Beyond Earth left off, but practically speaking, all that means is that the preceding game\'s cardboard cutout leaders have been stood in front of Starship\'s backgrounds. Each has a unique stat bonus in place of an actual personality, and their speech is characteristically mechanistic. ""Our computer calculations indicate that you have but a 19% chance of dominating this galaxy"" is what passes for a greeting in the game\'s stripped-down version of diplomacy. If you\'re thinking about declaring war after that (and I wouldn\'t blame you if you were), it\'s trivially easy to gauge your odds. Your opponents themselves provide an itemized list of their military assets on request--Starships is wanting for any other, more suitable screen to house the information. There are no ceremonial trappings, here. Two deadpan leaders simply meet, compare spreadsheets, and arrange peace or war accordingly.', ""You're presented with a similar rundown at the end of missions, tabulating all the ships destroyed and lost, and divvying out bonuses multiplied by various modifiers. Starships throws these figures and calculations at you, but there's nothing useful to be done with the information, as though the game just wants to make sure you know that it did the work. Numbers are always going up a thousand at a time in the game--you get lost in all that effortless forward momentum, and it becomes impossible to care about a few lost hundred here or there."", ""Beyond Earth's Affinities also make the jump, representing a choice between one of three broad societal values: Purity, Supremacy, or Harmony. But like everything in Starships, they've come unmoored from any cultural tie-downs, and now simply denote which of three arbitrary stat bonuses you feel like beginning the game with. Constructing a wonder means pressing a button when you've got enough of the requisite resource. There's no actual sense of building--a variable has simply shifted somewhere behind the scenes. It's an issue exacerbated by the fact that your ships are functionally immortal--though they appear to blow apart when destroyed in battle, you can still simply repair them afterward for a nominal cost. Even the loss of an entire fleet in a mission simply means being sent back to the planet you arrived from, down a few of the action points you expend to move around on the map on a turn. The stakes of this intragalactic war are at mechanical remove--any one defeat amounts only to an obscure amount of wasted man-hours."", ""As mobile games find new heights, Starships takes its sci-fi premise and uses it to trawl the primordial pools they ascended from. Its planets are suspended in a two dimensional plane, and when your turn is up, enemy fleets dart back and forth among them in seemingly random directions. They look less like interstellar armadas, and more like single celled organisms responding to simple stimuli. They flit about from planet to planet, hex cell to cell, as though guided by the basest biological compulsions, consuming and growing. And you're right alongside them--with a few disinterested clicks or swipes across the screen, killing, conquering, and leveling up."", ' ', ' ', ' ']"Jay Pullman,30-Mar-15,Dreamfall Chapters Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dreamfall-chapters-book-two-rebels-review/1900-6416084/,7,PC,"[""Coming off the heels of a rather sedentary first installment, Dreamfall Chapters Book Two: Rebels changes pace and propels the story into action. The first episode focused on finding your bearings and plotting your path; The second is all about setting that journey into motion. Book One did an admirable job of reacquainting its audience with the Dreamfall universe while providing a solid framework to build on in the chapters to follow. However, honing in that closely on the setup provided little room for follow through, and the lack of forward momentum left me less than satiated. Fortunately, the fruits of these labors are more than apparent in Book Two, which plucks off just enough to ramp up the action while leaving plenty to ripen on the vine in anticipation of what's to come."", ""Dreamfall is and has always been a story about duality--the yin & yang of Stark and Arcadia, magic and science, occupation and rebellion. These themes run deep in Book Two and offer a strong lens through which to view the bond between the journeys of two disparate leads: Zoe Castillo and Kian Alvane. Where Book One told a tale of parallel jailbreaks with Kian's escape from Azadi prison and Zoe's liberation from a Dreamtime-induced coma, Book Two continues this trend with a tale of two spies and a pair of fact-finding missions. With Kian embroiled in the Azadi conflict in Marcuria and Zoe finding herself at odds with the ever-increasing presence of EYE forces in Propast, the heroes launch headfirst into breaking down the mysteries and conspiracies within. And boy, do they have their work cut out for them."", ' ', ""For starters, Book Two is massive and takes over twice as long to complete as Book One. This is due both in part to the ample story progression and the introduction of a whole new, if familiar, environment in which to explore. While bigger isn't always better (and this is certainly true in some respects here), there is something satisfying about how the episode digs in, offering plenty of time to get lost in the world. There's a lot of meat on those bones, and this is excellent news for those of us who spent their time with the first book waiting for the story to go full-on Longest Journey. Book Two finally hits that stride and wastes no time getting there."", ""Book Two opens with Kian convalescing at Resistance headquarters, the underground ring of Arcadian rebels formerly led by the Captain to combat the growing Azadi threat. It is as if Robin Hood is being introduced to the band of Merry Magicals: Kian is ordered to prove his loyalty to the cause, and before long, finds himself roaming the streets of Marcuria. While wandering through the city in the game's third-person perspective, it was difficult not to get excited to be back on these old stomping grounds, and I had forgotten just how great a contrast the fantasy vibe of Marcuria provides when juxtaposed against the futuristic, Blade Runner-meets-Beyond Good & Evil aesthetic of Stark."", ""Like revisiting the house you grew up in many years later, Marcuria is simultaneously familiar and strange. The landmarks are still here (The Magic Market! The Journeyman Inn! The Rooster and Kitty!... wait, didn't that tavern go by a different name before?), but many areas are tweaked, askew, or entirely new. While several popular haunts have been abandoned since the occupation, there are plenty of new nooks and crannies to explore, leaving Marcuria feeling cautiously lively, like a party in a prison cell."", ""Where Book One told a tale of parallel jailbreaks with Kian's escape from Azadi prison and Zoe's liberation from a Dreamtime-induced coma, Book Two continues this trend with a tale of two spies and a pair of fact-finding missions."", ""This is not necessarily all for the best, however. As Kian ticks his way down the Resistance's to-do list, he must do so donning an Irhadian Veil so as not to be recognized by his fellow Azadi patrolling the streets. Narratively, this makes perfect sense. Since Kian was initially imprisoned for treason, anonymity should be a high priority. In practice, however, Kian's pace slows to a crawl anytime he passes a guarded gate or entryway, which yields a lot of tedious slow-walking as he makes the transition. As it is, navigating the town is sludgy enough, and you will find yourself holding down the run button constantly just to feel like youre moving at a reasonable pace. These belligerently slow zones, while not terribly prevalent, are enough to frustrate when moving between areas."", ""Unfortunately, the same goes for Zoe's trek through Propast as well. While Kian works to dig up dirt on the Azadi in Marcuria, Zoe investigates a possible source of corruption within the political campaign she works for and what, if any, connection there is to the EYE and WATICorp. As Zoe gets closer to the answer, Propast's faux-pen world layout becomes less accessible to her. Roadblocks are increased, security is beefed up, and carving a path through the city becomes a puzzle all on its own. It's an effective way of communicating the EYE's growing threat through environmental storytelling, but as someone who often found himself disoriented on the streets of Propast, I did not appreciate the constant detouring required of Zoe in order to reach many of her destinations."", 'Perhaps the most baffling detour of Book Two occurs back in Arcadia when Kian is tasked with sneaking into Marcuria Harbor to sabotage a weapons shipment. Apparently, his magical veil loses some of its mojo in this area as the guards here are able to detect Kian\'s presence if he gets too close, initiating a fail-state. Not only is it an incredibly awkward slog to complete, but my attempts were riddled with bugs, robbing me of success the first couple times I managed to satisfy all passing requirements. It\'s aggravating and flies in the face of the more cerebral types of quests presented in the series so far. To add insult to burglary, when I finally managed to reach the cut-scene, I was awarded with the Steam achievement, ""I Thought There Wouldn\'t Be Stealth!"" Its description reads, ""So you thought there wouldn\'t be stealth and also you suck at it,"" as if the lack of a proper toolset to engage in stealth--such as sneaking, or crouching, or any sort of visual feedback--had anything to do with the player\'s input. No, Dreamfall Chapters, it is you who sucks at it.', ' ', ""Mechanical flaws aside, Dreamfall Chapters soars when its quests provide the connective tissue between narrative mystery, tension, and resolution, and Book Two offers some excellent entries in this department. On their own, most missions offer little more than the deduction-based adventure-game fare familiar to Dreamfall vets. But string them together and a bigger picture comes into focus--one that leverages incremental progress with gratifying bursts of dramatic revelation. Without giving too much away, Dreamfall Chapters understands that what makes solving a key puzzle interesting isn't the act of opening the door, but discovering who's behind it and the intense conversations that arise as a result."", ""On this note, including dialogue choices is a natural progression for the series. As we have been told, Zoe's destination is predetermined, but her path along the way is not. This jives with the way the game's Bioware-style branching conversations work. The details change, but the big finish usually remains consistent. So while there may be less expectation for player choices to have a drastic impact on the final outcome of the plot, they do have a measurable impact on the smaller, more idiosyncratic moments (Reza's lunch will have repercussions!), and I found myself enjoying the smattering of incremental payoffs rather than anticipating a much larger one that may or may not come later. Again, it has a layered effect that, when added up, amount to an effective and intricate feat of storytelling."", ""It all comes back to the trilogy's bread & butter--its cast of characters. Book Two enjoys more colorful dialogue from the likes of Mira, the abusively foul-mouthed cybernetic chop-shopper; Baruti, the Botswanian campaign manager; and the nefarious Commander Vamon leading the Azadi occupation. If Kian is the Robin Hood of the story, Vamon is undoubtedly the Sheriff of Nottingham."", 'Dreamfall Chapters soars when its quests provide the connective tissue between narrative mystery, tension, and resolution.', ""To keep things fresh, there is also an influx of new and notable characters gracing the second act. For instance, in Arcadia there is Lihko, a wounded Dolmari warrior outspoken against Kian's presence who begrudges him for his Azadi heritage and the sacrifice made by the Resistance to save him. He's a complex and conflicted character whose intimidating presence is amplified by his booming voice."", 'At his side, there is Enu, a sassy feline Zhid with a curious mind and zero filter. In contrast to Lihko, her flirty frankness and positive attitude help to make Kian feel as welcome as possible given the circumstance. Without a doubt she is one of the more interesting and entertaining characters to be introduced so far. Her snarky dialogue and too-much-information attitude, especially regarding sex, inject much-needed comic relief within a group that is otherwise all business.', ""In addition, there's the mysterious Anna, a cunning rogue who appears to have a history with Kian despite his lapse in memory of any such relationship. Also crawling out of the woodwork is The Mole, Bip the thief, Hanna the punk rock runaway, and even a familiar face or two from Zoe's past. Other than an underwhelming showing by Reza, who's the most consistently mediocre brat of the pack, this episode walks the Dreamfall walk with plenty of meaningful roles to fulfill and subvert the archetypes within. With unique and diverse characters such as these, the series continues its tradition of utilizing a fantastic ensemble cast--an aspect that cannot be understated but was lacking by the end of Book One."", ' ', ""The Longest Journey series is a collection of inhabitable moments and by the end of this act, I appreciated what each moment had amounted to. This is emphasized by the radically tense cliffhanger the episode goes out on, which had me questioning every step that led up to it. As these pivotal moments pass, they offer new opportunities to reflect on the events that have come before them. They have a cumulative effect that changes the way in which you see the big picture. What happens in Stark can inform your understanding of what is happening in Arcadia and vice-versa, for their fates are interconnected. And as Kian and Zoe's worlds parallel each other, Dreamfall's world parallels our own, offering social and political commentary via the themes of its stories and the lives of its inhabitants. Book Two succeeds in reminding us that our destination may be predetermined, but our path is not. It's how we choose to travel, and who we keep by our side, that makes the journey worthwhile.""]"Peter Brown,30-Mar-15,Axiom Verge Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/axiom-verge-review/1900-6416083/,8,PS4,"[""At some point in your life, you wake up in an unexpected place. You open your eyes, and for a split second, confusion takes over. You may be on your couch after a sleepy night of watching bad television, or, you may find yourself in bed next to a stranger in a room you don't recognize. But, what are the odds that you'll ever wake up in a different world?"", ""Axiom Verge is your chance. Following an experiment on Earth gone horribly wrong, you wake up in a strange place known as Sudra. It's a world unlike Earth, where strange biological formations meld with mechanical contraptions to form massive structures. Being inexplicably transported to such a place would rock most people's psyche, but the protagonist, Trace, barely bats an eye. It's weird that he doesn't collapse in shock, honestly, but this misstep doesn't detract from the fact that Axiom Verge's plot is so good at drawing you in with heavy doses of mystery and intrigue. These moments kick off when large mechanical beings known as the Rusulka enter the picture. They act as guides, providing directions in exchange for repairs (something has left them in disarray), and insight into Sudra's troubled history. I'd love to go into greater detail, but to describe the relationship between you and the Rusulka any further would spoil one of the best aspects of Axiom Verge's world. It's a world that emphasizes exploration in the same vein that Super Metroid or Castlevania: Symphony of the Night do, but it's also a quest for knowledge that keeps you guessing until the very end."", ""As you make your way through Sudra's foreboding world at the behest of the Rusulka, you encounter numerous types of imposing wildlife. The only bad thing that can be said of the enemies in the game is that you occasionally find one that feels out of place, and this small inconsistency is one of a mere couple issues with the game, neither of which are important enough to detract from your enjoyment in a significant way. Big or small, Axiom Verge's enemies command your attention with wildly varying behavior and impressive displays of force. Some let out ear piercing battle cries while slashing at you with great speed, while others use more creative means to attack, such as spewing swarms of energy leeching bugs that are difficult to shake. It takes time and practice to learn how to deal with the trickier enemies, but you quickly gain new weapons as you explore, and thus new methods to defend yourself become available."", ""Your primary weapon, the Axiom Disruptor, fires simple energy-bullets, but you quickly rack up augmentations that make it capable of delivering shotgun-like blasts of electricity, or a beam of current not unlike what you might see in a Ghostbusters movie, for example. With more than a dozen weapons to find, you have to spend a lot of time searching for each and every one. While you don't need every weapon to be efficient at blasting away enemies that stand in your path, you learn to love many of the weapons over time, and who doesn't like having options?"", ""There are other tools to discover that make navigating Sudra manageable, let alone possible. A laser drill lets you plow through rock (and some tough-skinned enemies), revealing new pathways and potential secrets. You eventually find a grappling hook that turns you into a veritable Bionic Commando, allowing you to bridge large gaps and swing across ceilings. Like in Metroid, you can sneak through small tunnels that you find, but not by morphing into a ball. Rather, you find a drone that can do the exploring for you. It has its own life bar and some modest firepower, and while it's out and about, you get to rest inside an impenetrable force field. A quick press of a button, and the drone dismantles itself before zipping back to your location. Eventually, it becomes a remote teleportation device, allowing you to warp to its location."", ""One tool stands out as the most special of the lot: the Address Disruptor. This device can corrupt enemies or repair garbled matter, which has many implications and uses during your adventure. Sometimes, firing it at glitchy matter will yield a new platform that will help you get to a new location, while other times it can clear a path. The most interesting application, however, is using it to transform enemies. Every enemy has a different reaction to the Address Disruptor, and it's critical to pay attention to the particulars therein. An enemy that spawns laser firing bugs may suddenly spawn life energy once you've corrupted it, while another may start to gnaw away at rock, which you can use to your advantage when trying to access hard to reach areas. There are dozens of different behaviors associated with the Address Disruptor, and it's easily one of the most interesting weapons or tools that I've ever seen in a game."", ""One enemy's reaction in particular leads me to talk about the game's password system. Within the inventory and map menu lies a place to input passwords. Passwords can trigger different things, such as changing your outfit or allowing you to read previously indecipherable texts. All of the info in the documents you find are supplements to the story, but they also stoke your curiosity to dig deeper into the mysterious events of the past and present. Passwords aren't just given out, you need to work to find them. In one case, a hard to reach document contains a translation string, another reveals itself when you use the Address Disruptor on a glitchy area of the map. My favorite, and the basis of this segue, is the enemy that reveals a code, letter by letter, after it's been corrupted. This particular enemy is only in one room, and even though there are others like it to be found on the map, it only provides a password in this particular instance. Moments like this are when you realize that you must use every tool at your disposal if you hope to uncover all of the secrets that lie within Axiom Verge. It takes a lot of work to find some items, but you get a real sense of accomplishment when you overcome difficult situations by combining your skills in clever ways."", ""Part of the reason you want to find secrets and secret areas is because you may gain a new weapon or ability, but also because your speed, map coverage, and item percentage have an impact on the game's ending. No matter what, Axiom Verge's final third will satisfy your curiosity and surprise you, but you learn more about Trace if you get through the game with efficiency and an attention to detail."", ""Accomplishing everything it takes to get the absolute best ending isn't easy, especially your first time through. It took me the better part of 14 hours to get through to the end, and even with all of that time, I only uncovered 92% of the map and found 70% of the items. It's not an impressive run by any measure, but it would have been far worse if Axiom Verge punished you for every death, which I experienced dozens of during the course of my journey. Thankfully, dying only sends you back to the last save point on the map with all of your progress kept intact. While this may mean that you're teleported back a significant distance across Sudra, any milestones you've hit are preserved, meaning you don't need to waste precious time repeating previous efforts."", ""Speaking of repeating previous efforts, once the credits finished rolling, I couldn't wait to jump back in and start Trace's journey all over again. Some games conclude and I'm happy to walk away, but Axiom Verge is such a joy to play, with dozens of tools to play with, and too many secrets to find. The skills and rules you learn inform your expectations and plans, and my second trip through became more about the gameplay than the story, which isn't entirely a bad thing. After all, the better I play, the better the payoff in the end. I'm still working through Sudra for the second time, occasionally going back to my first save to identify things I may have missed so that I'm prepared when I encounter them again."", ""Axiom Verge is a game that's easy to fall in love with because it hits so many high notes. It takes the Metroidvania model and adds layers of ingenuity that are in a league all of their own, the most notable being the Address Disruptor. Yes it's occasionally drab looking, and some enemies may not fit in with the rest of the world, but when a game is this good, these blemishes quickly fade into the back of your mind. The chilling sci-fi setting, mysterious plot, and a seemingly endless number of abilities keep your mind busy, and your curiosity at fever pitch. It's not a stretch to say that Axiom Verge is better than the games that inspired it, because it's so inventive and thoughtfully crafted. There's no excuse to hold onto the past when the present is this amazing."", ' ']"Peter Brown,27-Mar-15,Resogun Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resogun-defenders-review/1900-6416061/,7,PS4,"[""Housemarque's voxel-packed side-scrolling shooter Resogun is easy to love for it's stimulating visuals and soundtrack, but once your newfound fascination with voxels and dance music finally cools, it's the challenge to survive and the call of the high score that draws you back. This tradition is upheld in the new Defenders DLC, which contains two new modes: Protector and Commando. Protector mode is a more punishing and exciting variation of the standard game--you earn powerful upgrades at a rapid pace but typically die in one hit--while the Commando mode has you defend the last house on the planet as either Arnold Schwarzenegger or an Arnold Schwarzenegger impersonator, sans spaceship."", ""OK. It's obviously not Arnold Schwarzenegger, but while defending humanity's last home from incoming enemy spacecraft and environmental hazards, you do randomly spout some famous lines in his voice. It's a fun touch, but don't let the comedic side of Protector get in the way of what's most important: defending that house. You run along the ground, firing into the sky as enemies nosedive into frame. Although the house you're defending can withstand some damage, similar to structures in the classic game Missile Command, all it takes is one hit for you to die in Commando mode, and there are no continues. You do have a few of the same abilities as your spaceship, including bombs and speed boosts, and you can jump, which is useful when ground-based enemies eventually appear. Because you can fire in more than two directions with the right analog stick, Commando mode feels like it has more in common with twin-stick shooters than it does with Resogun."", ""Blasting through increasingly difficult waves of enemies in Commando mode is challenging and the Schwarzenegger impersonations are humorous, but fighting on foot isn't as thrilling as zipping around in a ship. You don't move particularly fast, and your gun is underpowered for what feels like too long relative to how fast the number of targets increases on screen. This new style of gameplay is intriguing because it's different, but it lacks the sense of speed and excitement that's typical of Resogun. That's not to imply that it's bad or even not fun--you still experience the wonder of voxels and the drive to earn higher and higher scores, and likely a bit of laughter--but Commando mode just doesn't compare to the rest of Resogun."", ""If you're looking for something more fast-paced and exciting, focus on Protector mode. It plays very similar to Resogun proper, where you zoom around a ring-shaped level, shooting down enemy ships and rescuing vulnerable humans on the ground, but you earn weapons and armor upgrades at a much faster rate than usual. The trade-off is that enemy swarms grow equally fast and you don't start with any extra lives; the only second chances you get are in the form of expendable shields that occasionally come as bonuses for saving humans."", ""Piloting a fully-upgraded ship is a treat rarely afforded in other modes, where extended boosts and more destructive overdrive cannons are reserved for the best players, so Protector mode is a great way to experience a side of the game that may have been out of reach before. It's oh-so-sweet to have a massively upgraded ship, and because the difficulty also scales fast, you still feel like you're being challenged, even with all of the added firepower."", ""If Resogun has already run its course in your mind, there's nothing in Defenders that's going to lure you back in for the long haul. Of course, it's hard to imagine how someone could ever get enough Resogun, being that it's one of the best arcade-game experiences in years. In that sense, Defenders is a worthy addition to an already great game that will no doubt please anyone with a fondness for fighting within an inch of their life while also blowing up everything in sight into tiny, beautiful pieces."", ' ']"Austin Walker,27-Mar-15,Dragon Age: Inquisition Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-inquisition-jaws-of-hakkon-review/1900-6416081/,7,PC,"[""It's been about four months since I've spent quality time in the world of Thedas--nearly 70 hours' worth of it. This week's content release for Dragon Age: Inquisition, Jaws of Hakkon, may have jump started my engine, reminding me what I love most about the core game: the sense of wonder, the thematic richness, a fantastic sense of place and personality. The new adventure becomes available in the second act of the game, taking your Inquisitor to the Frostback Basin, the foothills and valley near the mountain range at the southern end of Thedas. You've been called in to provide support for an archaeological survey of the region that is searching for the final resting place of the world's last Inquisitor, Ameridan. While piecing together the mystery of Ameridan, you'll have to navigate the region's complex geography and even more complex sociopolitical relationships."", ""The Frostback Basin is a deceptively big zone. What seems easily conquerable on the map screen is actually a sizable and intricate mix of environments. Foothills open up into plateaus, which feature deep, dangerous pits. A lakeshore runs into the bubbling, muddy shallows of the basin, and those turn into misty swamplands and damp jungles. It's all brought to life with vibrant color and fresh ambient sounds. The Frostback Basin feels distinct from the game's other zones, and it's mostly a joy to explore."", ' ', 'I say ""mostly,"" because sometimes it feels like BioWare is trying to stretch out the available content in Jaws of Hakkon. Over the course of eight hours in the Frostback Basin, five different missions make you ""follow the trail"" across territory you\'ve already explored thoroughly in the course of doing other missions. Most egregious is a mission that sends you around to flip a number of switches scattered across the northern half of the zone. For the previous six hours of play, these switches had been visible but inactive, and I knew that they\'d send me back eventually. They did. This decision is particularly strange because Hakkon doesn\'t need to be stretched in any way. The Frostback Basin is packed with all of the elements that made me love Inquisition to begin with: smart characterization, interesting combat encounters, and carefully written lore.', 'The Frostback Basin is home to two rival tribes of the Avvar, a human society that briefly pops up early on in Inquisition. The development of these groups (and of the region\'s history in general) is the high point of Hakkon, and you\'ll get the most out of this DLC if you dig into the lore about these people and their culture and religion. Dragon Age has always been at its best when the stories it tells are multifaceted and mysterious, and the same is true here: Religious iconography blurs together; magical traditions are at once remarkably similar and fundamentally different; and the final, ""true"" history is often left unknown.', ""Best of all, the Avvar work to break apart the classic binaries that show up throughout the Dragon Age series. They share the Elven relationship to nature, but are human. They're human, but don't belong to any of the major political powers. They're deeply spiritual, but also incredibly practical. They have a strict system to govern the use of magic, but use terms and concepts to explain the magical world that are entirely different than those used by the Templars and Circle of Mages. All of this works to complicate the world of Thedas by providing yet another potential perspective to consider."", 'This makes it extra frustrating that so little of Jaws of Hakkon shares the cinematic sheen of the rest of Inquisition. Most other zones in the world of Thedas have a mix of two different sorts of quests. Firstly, there are the little, MMOG-style missions you complete for this or that character: kill ten bears, or recover a missing satchel, or perform some other small task. Secondly, there are the major story missions that take you out of the third-person perspective and into a cutscene view, where dramatic music supports characters who emote and animate as the plot unfolds. In Hakkon, only the very beginning and very end of the main questline offer this second sort of storytelling. Throughout the rest of my eight hours, I watched as world-shaking information was delivered without any pomp or luster.', 'If you told me last week that this would bother me, I\'d tell you that you\'d be absolutely wrong. But here I am, missing the intimate close-ups and the sweeping vistas. (Maybe this shouldn\'t be be surprising: Imagine an episode of Game of Thrones that never shows the detail of a character\'s face.) Over the course of the previous 70 hours, Dragon Age: Inquisition had quietly taught me to expect a certain rhythm: I\'d meander around a zone until I was ready to commit to one of the many ""big"" story events. There was a sort of storytelling grammar at work, and by reducing the use of that grammar, Hakkon rarely feels as substantial as it should. Thankfully, the final hour or so of Hakkon does utilize those storytelling tools to great effect, and it joins them with some new, unique mechanics in a series of major combat encounters that build momentum and velocity until an explosive climax.', ""Though I wish that Jaws of Hakkon was less bloated, and though I miss the cinematic flair of the rest of Dragon Age: Inquisition, I know that in a month I'll have forgotten these quibbles. Instead, I'll remember my time spent in Frostback Basin fondly. I'll remember the sharp wit of Svarah Sun-Hair, the leader of the local Avvar clan. I'll remember the holy symbols that blur the line between competing faiths. I'll remember the mist and the mountains and the sun's light through the trees. I'll remember confronting legendary foes, and the time I got to spend with some of my favorite characters in video games.""]"Alexa Ray Corriea,26-Mar-15,Life is Strange Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/life-is-strange-episode-two-review/1900-6416079/,7,PS4,"[""Life is Strange is at its best when it's letting you talk to people. Some of the best moments are between Max, the hero of this story, and Chloe, her new/old best friend. Others involve Max delicately navigating a verbal encounter with little to wield other than words...and if need be, her time-bending superpower. Life is Strange's first episode was a great setup for the world of Blackwell, where young adults struggle to find meaning and purpose in their lives, but was ultimately a little too bogged down by its time-rewinding mechanic. The mechanic still gets in the way of some poignant moments in Episode Two, Out of Time, but it is here that the game slowly begins introducing the limitations to Max's power. This not only makes for some interesting encounters but drives the episode to an emotional high point that left me feeling raw, empty, and very impatient for the next installment."", ""Max's story is getting darker. Chloe has warmed up to Max, and the episode opens with our young heroine on her way to meet her old friend for breakfast. She's still dealing with the fallout of her run-in with Nathan Prescott in the previous episode, and--depending on choices you made in the previous episode and a few ones you'll make early in this one--has becoming a looming, omnipresent threat to Max's existence. She's doing her best to balance this danger with being a good friend; not just to Chloe, but to Kate Marsh, another troubled girl. On top of all that, Max is getting wrapped up in Chloe's problems, which turn out to be more sinister than having a militant stepfather. And as before, the adults in Life is Strange act like frightened children, completely inept at being helpful to these angsty teens and behaving in ways that no sensible real-world adult would."", ""In Episode One, I was bothered by the throwaway mentions of Rachel Amber, the girl who took Max's place as Chloe's bestie after she moved away, and who has since gone missing. Episode Two drops large hints that maybe we're looking at the wrong people; this might not be Max's story after all, but the story of an even greater mystery. There may only be just enough room for Max in Chloe's and her friends' world to solve these horrible problems. A missing girl. An approaching tornado. The one person with the power to stop it all may be the least important in the equation."", ""Adding to the uptick in narrative intrigue is the gradual introduction of the limitations of Max's power. Red splotches crowd the sides of the screen every time you rewind, indicating that Max is physically harming herself with her abilities. Out of Time slaps Max, and you, with the realization that these powers come with a price. This fragility, the knowledge that these powers don't make Max some infallible entity that can perpetually change her choices, gives the choices you do make more weight. Max is no longer balancing teenage problems with unlimited power; she's balancing teenage problems with a dangerous tool that can harm as well as help."", 'The tone of Episode Two is confusing to place, largely because of lengthy sequences that come across as too ""gamey"" and thus detract from the story. There are two instances in this episode where Life is Strange aggressively reminds you that it is a video game; the heartfelt narrative of a young girl\'s struggle to be a force of good takes a backseat to fetch quests and memory puzzles. These moments weaken the tension of Life is Strange and I felt frustrated, as these sequences seem to take up time for the sake of adding some kind of game element. However, I learned to tamp down my impatience, as these moments give limitless breathing room to explore. I learned more about Chloe\'s relationship with Rachel by scouring a junkyard and more about Kate Marsh\'s home life by lingering in her dorm room. It doesn\'t become apparent until the end of the episode that these tedious stretches have huge story impact. This is why I say the tone is confusing; Life is Strange wants you to stay tense and pay attention, yet simultaneously encourages you to stop and smell the roses, without much warning of when you\'re supposed to do either. The solution is to keep on your toes, look at everything, and talk to everyone, because you genuinely never know when something will be important later.', 'This is never more evident than at the episode\'s end, when ""make or break"" becomes too light a description for what Max has to do. Every choice you\'ve made in the first two episodes, every decision you made connected to someone around Max, comes to a head here. This is where it ends, and where Life is Strange becomes more than an episodic video game. It becomes a window into the world of the young, where it\'s either your oyster or it\'s ending, when you\'re too naive to think of the future. Bullying, drugs, wanting to be liked, feeling misunderstood, channeling emptiness into lashing out at others--this is why life is strange as a young adult. It\'s a rare person that doesn\'t wish she they could go back and get just one more chance with someone, with something.', ""Out of Time gives real meaning to the choices you've made. And by its conclusion, you'll know whether or not Max, your version of Max, is a bad confidante. The episode's turning point depends on how well you've paid attention to your classmates, how flakey or how helpful you've been for a certain friend. It requires you to have scoured every nook and cranny, poked into every room and fed your curiosity by examining everything. Because if you haven't, the outcome can't be undone under any circumstances. Life is Strange is actively testing how much you, the player, care. It's a subtle way to imbue a lot of power into the choice mechanic, and it sneaks up on you without warning."", ""Despite the great way Out of Time handles emotional payoff, it suffers from problematic dialogue. Characters will display conflicting emotions over the course of a conversation that ping pong between extremely positive and extremely negative, without cause. In one instance, a character warms up to you and comments how you've been missed, and when you respond positively she suddenly, nastily, ask if you're making up for something you did wrong in Episode One. Another instance has someone admit she knows you care about her, and when you say that yes, you do care, she suddenly shouts that nobody cares about her. It makes no sense and makes many of these conversations feel like uphill battles in the dark. It's harder to placate someone or do what you think is right when there's a good chance that no matter what you say his or her response is completely out of your control."", ""Life is Strange still has problems with its dialogue and pacing, but Episode Two reaches emotional heights that are worth the journey. Your choices as Max are finally beginning to take on meaning, and the trajectory of her role in this messy story is more unclear than ever. But that's a good thing; stories about people with infallible power are boring. Max is no superhero; she's just a girl trying to be just and do right by everybody. But like in the real world, trying to please everyone has consequences, and Life is Strange lets you know that with a shot right to the heart.""]"John Robertson,25-Mar-15,Xenoblade Chronicles Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/xenoblade-chronicles-3d-review/1900-6416075/,8,3DS,"['Just as watching a film at the cinema offers a different experience from that of watching at home, playing on a handheld is a different proposition than playing on a television. The fact is, certain approaches fit one form of play better than another. It may sound obvious, but this is a reality of consumption often overlooked by those with power over game design.', ""Screen size is the primary factor dictating which features do and don't work across handhelds and console-based games. It's this, amid all of its splendid and eventual intrigue that the classic RPG Xenoblade Chronicles 3D has either failed to understand or simply not tackled for fear of altering what made its original incarnation so great. While it remains the remarkable game that it was when it was first released on the Wii in 2011, the reduced screen size Xenoblade Chronicles 3D has been squeezed on to does sour the experience."", ""The sense of scale generated by the game's imposingly large environments has been retained, as has the wider visual flair and depth of battles. Similarly, character models when viewed up close are surprisingly expressive given the limited colors and lines used to draw them. However, it's the little details that have suffered from the transition from the large to small screen."", 'Icons indicating the availability of a new quest or the presence of a shopkeeper, for instance, alongside the directional area pointing you to your next objective are far from clear and easy to miss amongst the extensive buffet of other imagery typically filling the screen. The latter can be especially confusing at times, forcing you to slow down your exploration efforts in order to perform constant references of the full map.', 'Everything feels a little cramped and, as a result, messy. Simple visual cues that should be easily digestible at a glance take too long to figure out, reducing the simplicity of interaction that allowed the Wii original to stretch its wings and present its more complex nuances with precision and clarity.', ""The New 3DS' 3D effect doesn't help either, further complicating the issue of space by overloading the visual impact. It's most noticeable when trying to identify enemies at a distant that are painted a similar shade to their environment. While the 3D is gorgeous during cut-scenes and moments not requiring much (or any) interaction, it gets in the way when the action picks up. Having to constantly turn it on and off is a minor problem given the New 3DS' positioning of the 3D slider, but it remains a nuisance."", ""That's New 3DS with a capital 'n' by design, because Xenoblade Chronicles 3DS only works on Nintendo's latest handheld iteration. Yes, if you have an older model you will have to pull out your wallet and part with your cash. It's the first game to require the new model by default and, as such, much is riding on its success--particularly the overriding consumer view of the hardware."", ""It's a shame, then, that more care hasn't been given to the macro details; if it wasn't for those it would be tempting to award this experience something approaching top marks. In all other areas this is an RPG that delivers the same extraordinary experience it did four years ago. Such was the originality of its ideas back then that today it makes the majority of its younger genre peers look positively archaic by comparison."", ""The real-time combat system shines especially bright, offering a deceptively easy to learn set of rules that are continually enriched and diversified as you're drawn further into the plot and up the character levels. For instance, attacking from behind can cause extra damage, while attacking from the side can lower physical defense. Later you can chain character-specific moves between all three characters, adding more depth to already intricate combat. By opening the door to new tactical avenues so frequently, and providing a wide range of enemies to test them against, there's rarely an area or period of play in which battles feel stale or repetitive."", ""Considering the length of the game, some 70 hours or more, this should be considered a towering achievement. It's a shame that the visual restrictions do inhibit some of the combat's appeal in comparison to the Wii edition, but it's worth sticking with it to explore and appreciate the varied action during skirmishes. It's also worth checking out Xenoblade's many side quests, which--thanks to some deep subplots and character exploration--are far more interesting than the run-of-the-mill fetch quests you'd find in lesser RPGs."", ""Similar time and effort has gone into the narrative, a tale of giant titans and warring colonies that's rich and energetically presented thanks to a skilfully orchestrated English-language localization effort. While the voiceover work is most certainly pointed towards the sillier and more childlike end of the acting spectrum, the charm with which it has been carried out makes it difficult not to enjoy."", ""The style of acting provides an accurate barometer for the wider experience as whole; Xenoblade Chronicles is so unlike what most other Japanese RPGs have attempted over the past decade or so. Dialogue and character reactions rarely fall foul of the stifling conventional cliches that can plague even the most revered games in this genre, mirroring the degree to which you're pleasantly surprised by the scale of the world and the combat. Xenoblade might have been crammed into a smaller space, but that has certainly not diminished the well-rounded and varied characterization of its cast."", ""While it's an inferior proposition to its initial release in 2011, Xenoblade Chronicles 3D remains superior to the majority of RPGs. The move to 3DS has harmed the act of playing, but if you can look past the clunky signage and questionable 3D then you'll find a game that remains an amazing high point for the genre, one that'll absorb you right up to its glorious finale.""]"Alexa Ray Corriea,23-Mar-15,Game of Thrones: A Telltale Games Series Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/game-of-thrones-episode-three-the-sword-in-the-dar/1900-6416076/,8,PC,"['Everything youve been fighting for up to this point is finally in front of you. The third episode of Telltales Game of Thrones will decide whether or not you get what you want, and whether or not you need to stop thinking and just start running.', ""The Sword in the Darkness does an excellent job of mirroring the Game of Thrones HBO series tendency to place a high-tension, high-energy episode smack in the middle of a season. Episode Three never lets you catch your breath; each scene features major choices with consequences that ripple out to this chapter's credits--characters will continue to harp on decisions made early in the episode--and hint at larger problems to come in following episodes."", 'Episode Three upset me in ways the first two episodes havent. It made me physically anxious. As someone who has read all the books in A Song of Ice and Fire and generally knows whats coming in the television series, its fabulously disturbing to see Telltales characters get kicked around and have no idea how their story ends.', 'You will let a lot of people down in The Sword in the Darkness. Every plot-hinging choice leaves someone you love out in the cold, debating how much they can trust you. You must choose between family and best friends, mothers and sisters, the lady youve sworn to serve and the lord youve made a dubious pact with. Friendships and alliances are made at the expense of breaking others. Game of Thrones nails the sentiment that author George R. R. Martin hammers home across A Song of Ice and Fire: you cant please everyone, and the second you displease someone, you better watch your back.', 'The Sword in the Darkness brings plot threads that were left free-floating in Episode Two to their high points. Rodrik struggles to stand his ground against the cruel Whitehills while still treading carefully because the youngest Forrester, Ryon, remains the Whitehills captive. Half a world away, Asher and Beskha, joined by Malcolm, chase Daenerys Targaryen across the desert, searching for an army of sellswords to bring home to Ironrath. In Kings Landing, on the eve of the royal wedding, Mira must choose between waiting for Margaery Tyrell to have time to help her and seeking out her own, less favorable alliances. Gared, just as hes settling into life with the Nights Watch, is thrown a curve ball that proves he cant escape his past.', 'It is in this episode that you finally see the fruits of your labor bloom; every big choice youve made in Episode One and Two catches up with you. Situations you tried to clean up, like the strange incidents with Mira and the coal boy or negotiating alliances with other northern houses, are proven to be un-cleanable. Everything youve worked for can be destroyed in seconds or made worse, depending on the people you side with.', 'Decisions available to you, as members of House Forrester, always revolve around what is best for the family. But some family members and their allies differ in what they feel is the right course of action. Episode Three brings to the forefront the struggle to keep your family placated and safe, either by listening to them, making empty promises, or acting on your own when you dont have time to consult them. Theres a moment where Rodrik has to choose between standing up to the Whitehills to defend his little sister Talia, or biting his tongue and taking the abuse because his mother worries what repercussions his actions will have on Ryons safety. Its a powerful moment, being forced to choose between your mother and your sister, showing weakness and allowing your enemy to walk all over you in hopes the danger subsides, or standing tall and showing strength because your baby sister is counting on you. The outcome is awful no matter what, because youve let someone down either way, and you always feel horrible.', 'There arent many combat sections in The Sword in the Darkness, as most of the episode is focused on verbally navigating situations and choosing the heinousness of the lies you tell. There is also not much time given to exploring environments, and in each segment when you get to poke around, youre looking for something within a time limit. Twice I had to search for things--like a piece of paper or an escape route--while enemies were on the approach, leaving little room to look around. Its a bit disappointing, as it takes away from the world feeling lived-in, with objectives in straight lines rather than allowing some wiggle room.', 'Once again, the Forresters continue to be the most interesting characters on screen, and their plight is much more interesting than whats going on with Jon Snow or Margaery. But the way Game of Thrones canon characters come into play in Episode Three is great. Their presence seamlessly weaves into and out of the plot, with small things like a brief comment from Cersei Lannister making Margaery question your loyalty. Tyrion, Cersei, Margaery, theyre not just dangerous people to placate with conversation anymore; they are now completely in charge of your fate.', 'Most of this is witnessed through Miras storyline, as she has the most direct contact with them. As of Episode Three, Miras story is by far the most intriguing, as shes playing with fire on a level a little higher than her siblings. Her plot started off slow in the first two episodes, but her struggle is the center of Episode Three, and shes playing a game as intricate as those currently struggling for Westeros crown.', ""Asher and Beshkas tale continues to delight, as the two of them play beautifully off each other with their bantering and sibling-like bond. The Ironrath plot, however, is starting to get dull; Rodrik and those left behind in the North continue to beat their heads against the Whitehills to no avail. The events are repetitive: Rodrik or another Forrester stands up to the Whitehill member in charge, the Forresters get slapped around, and the Whitehill in charge is replaced with another Whitehill a little meaner than the last. Each Whitehill makes the same promise to destroy the Forresters if they don't submit to authority, but so far there's only been some light kicking and punching. As of now, the Whitehills dont feel like a threat as devastating as Ramsay Snow, but Im unwilling to discount them just yet."", 'And finally, Gared and his secret about the North Grove have been given more attention and care within the narrative. What was tossed around briefly in the last two episodes is finally in the spotlight and becomes a matter of grave importance very quickly. Just like the series its based on, Game of Thrones has taken something small and seemingly minor and ripped off the curtain to reveal it as the most important thing you know.', 'Game of Thrones third episode succeeds in making you feel like the rest of the season is hinging on the decisions you make. It marks the narrative apex so far, the highest dramatic climax, with its barrage of tough choices in rapid succession. You cant help but feel bad for these characters; it looks like theres no way for them to win. If youve been playing it safe up to this point, deferring to answers that keep the characters safe and relatively benign, youre in for a rude awakening. Episode Three marks the beginning of the end for neutrality. There are tough decisions to make and no way around them, making this episode true to the Game of Thrones atmosphere at its core.']"Cameron Woolsey,23-Mar-15,Borderlands: The Handsome Collection Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/borderlands-the-handsome-collection-review/1900-6416077/,8,PS4,"['As famed gun merchant and narrator Marcus Kincaid would say, Borderlands is about stories: tales of villains and antiheroes, of weapons and treasure, and of course, of mysterious vaults safeguarding fantastic riches...or unspeakable horror. So the legends go, at least. But one tale in particular has stood among the rest. It is about a man named Jack, who rose from the position of programmer in a weapons manufacturer, to self-declared dictator of a hostile arid planet known as Pandora. It is his story that is the focus of Borderlands: The Handsome Collection, a console-only package including the series most recent cooperative first-person releases, complete with updated graphics and enough additional content to sink Wam Bam Island.', 'Its a convincing package, as The Handsome Collection consists of both Borderlands 2 and Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel. The upgrade is warranted if you own a current system and only played the originals, or if you have yet to delve into the massive amount of add-ons for either game. Its too bad however, that Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel comes up short, in both mission design and presentation.', ""Though I find it unfortunate that the original Borderlands isnt included, its not like The Handsome Collection is wanting for content. There is a ton to see and do here, with Borderlands 2 encompassing the lions share of whats stamped on the disk. Together with The Pre-Sequel, the games come paired with numerous add-on packs that include side campaigns, challenge arenas, character skins, upgraded level caps, and four additional vault hunters--two for each game. The amount of extras is incredible, especially considering that both games are lengthy on their own, coming in at several dozen hours each. And that's not even counting true vault hunter mode, which allows you to replay the campaigns at a higher difficulty for a chance at rarer loot. The included season pass for Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel means that not only do you have access to content currently available, but also future add-ons, including Claptastic Voyage, the first campaign add-on for The Pre-Sequel which launches the same day as The Handsome Collection."", 'If you have yet to experience the side missions in either game, its imperative to note that some of the DLC takes place canonically after the events of their main campaigns. So keep that in mind if you want to avoid any unnecessary spoilers. In addition, if you have already played either of the two games, The Handsome Collections allows you to transfer your save files from the older consoles within the same console family (Xbox 360 to Xbox One, PS3 to PS4).', 'Borderlands 2 does little to change the classic Borderlands formula of shooting and looting, bringing more evolution than revolution. The game reintroduces Pandora as a more engaging world, bringing in nastier enemies as well as a host of lovable characters, most of them sane enough to lend some help or provide small quests, but eccentric enough to make you wonder if their harsh lifestyles warped their minds. The writing is given a fresh kick, bringing vigor to the vault hunters and Pandoras citizens with fantastic and often hilarious dialogue, which effortlessly has you swaying from grins to belly laughs and back again. Though the characters are chattier, there is a downside: Conversations tend to bleed into each other, and you often miss whats being said. However, you usually get the gist of whats going on from updates to your mission status. The blistering combat is the one thing that remains mostly the same, and it is still tight and satisfying, with multiple enemy variants and imposing, memorable boss battles.', 'Other than the allure of gathering the best loot around, Borderlands 2 also keeps your interest high as youre challenged to create the most powerful vault hunter possible. Experience points are doled out following kills and completed missions, and with each level gained you are given a skill point to develop new or existing abilities in your vault hunters skill tree. Some of these skills favor supporting solo or cooperative play, while others passively enhance base stats such as critical hit damage or health recharge rate. You also have several skills that improve your vault hunters action skill, his or her signature move. Completing challenges as you move through the game awards you with badass tokens, which you spend on giving your characters--all of them at once--small attribute boosts.', 'More importantly, not only to the plot of Borderlands 2 but to the collection in general, the game is the first to introduce the violent and sarcastic villain--and Hyperion CEO--Handsome Jack. Its clear from the games explosive onset: Jack is one seriously bad guy. But he also commands one of the games most memorable roles. His mockery of the vault hunters, though incredibly amusing, is tinged with darkness. Yes, you will chuckle at his antics--one in particular related to a diamond horse he lovingly names Butt Stallion still gets me. Yet that laughter becomes a nervous chuckle as Jack details a time he pulled out a mans eyeballs with a spoon as his family watched in horror. Jack is all too obliged to flex the military arm of Hyperion, sending waves of robot attackers to take you and your fellow vault hunters down for good.', ""Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel's story takes place between the first two games, but builds itself on top of the groundwork laid out by Borderlands 2, yet with a fresh, gravity-defying twist. The game takes you on a brief tour of the ominous Hyperion space station before sending you to Pandoras cold, fractured moon of Elpis. The oxygen-free environments provide a different challenge to overcome. Your survival relies on Oz Kits, which provide not only a supply of precious oxygen, but act as a jet booster to lift you high into the air and allow you to return to the ground in a thunderous butt slam. The decreased gravity completely changes how you approach combat, allowing both you and your enemies to battle from both the ground and floating through the air. It requires you to remain cognizant of not only whats in front of you, but also on dangers above and below. The updated combat is enthralling; Its familiar enough to naturally dive into, while the high-flying escapades prevent it from growing stale."", 'With The Handsome Collection, I looked forward to the chance of experiencing The Pre-Sequels campaign once more. After all, the game weaves the humorous tale of Jacks rise from a Hyperion programmer to its nefarious head honcho. But even though I once more savored the feeling of lazily swimming through vacuum, popping the heads of enemy scavs, I realized I wasnt enjoying my return visit to Elpis. When I reviewed The Pre-Sequel late last year, one of my critiques involved mission pacing, and how some quests became tiresome ventures. Indeed, several missions are either overly lengthy, or feature moments of too little inactivity. When compounded by a drop in speed due to the weaker gravity, the sense of urgency is damaged.', 'I hesitate calling the The Handsome Collection ""remastered,"" regardless of how often the word is printed on the game box. (That number is three.) It hasnt received the sort of intense graphical overhaul as, say, Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster, and its not as if the games required it. Borderlands 2, the older of the two games, was released in 2012, hardly long enough ago to cultivate even a modest patina to be scrubbed clean. Instead, its far more honest to say that the games have been unshackled, released from the technological restraints of the aged Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. In other words, what The Handsome Collection offers is nothing that hasnt been seen on a high-end PC.', 'But that doesnt mean the visuals are not deserving of your attention. The aesthetics for both games, The Pre-Sequel in particular, are marvelous in The Handsome Collection. Borderlands traditional cel-shaded design is crisp, with bright colors that burst with life. You can almost feel the heat rising from one of Pandoras many deserts, and my return to the lovely tropical-flavored Wam Bam Island was made even more spectacular thanks to the sharper graphics. And I dare you not to stand in awe of Elpis twinkling, starry canopy, or the multi-colored mists slowly rising from its ocean of ice-cold methane.', 'Sadly, those gorgeous lunar vistas do come with a cost. The Handsome Collection boasts a video output of 1080p running at 60 frames per second, and that holds mainly true for Borderlands 2, which mostly performs at a buttery smooth pace. But if Borderlands 2 is analogous to creamy butter, then The Pre-Sequel is more akin to the peanut varietythe chunky kind. You wont notice the frame drops so long as youre within smaller, enclosed spaces. Walking outside grants you a far clearer understanding, as if the game is softly applying brakes. In larger, detailed areas, as well as during intense battles, performance hits are common enough to become distracting, able to pull you out of the mood time and time again. The problem is exacerbated when running The Pre-Sequel in split-screen multiplayer, with slowdown occurring at nearly every interval. Normally, the game is set to run at 30 FPS for up to four screens, but I was lucky to get that on most occasions. I only ran it with the game split between two players; Id hate to see what happens when its doubled.', 'In the spirit of fairness, Borderlands 2 isnt completely in the clear, itself. Frame rate noticeably drops during moments of heavy combat; however, it isnt comparable to the turbulence found in The Pre-Sequel. Its a fleeting, almost unexpected thing, sticking around only long enough to make you think Oh? before vanishing completely. In my first 10 hours into Borderlands 2, the frames dipped only a few times, which did not harm my overall enjoyment to the extent that The Pre-Sequel could muster.', 'The Handsome Collection is still a great compilation, allowing you to witness not only Jacks tale, but play a major role in shaping the history of Pandora itself, along with its lonely moon.', 'The audio remains the same quality, though its hardly lacking by any definition. Both games star extravagant weaponry, all of which can be easily distinguished by your ears alone: sniper rifles and shotguns shatter the calm Pandoran air, while laser guns pop and sizzle over Elpis cragged lunar surface. Most of the voiceover work is fantastic, with a special nod going toward Dameon Clarke as the sassy Handsome Jack himself. The Western-inspired soundtrack of Borderlands 2, with music composed of wind flutes and the soft plucks of acoustic guitars, is as delightful as I remember. Sitting on the opposite end of the spectrum is The Pre-Sequels album of synthesized digital tunes, which doesnt quite stand out as readily, but keeps well to the games overall futuristic tone.', 'Lets be clear: You dont have to be Handsome Jacks number-one fan to appreciate Borderlands: The Handsome Collection. But even if youre not, you will still find an impressive archive, chock full of dozens upon dozens of hours of laughter and exciting combat. Even considering issues presented by Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, The Handsome Collection is still a great compilation, allowing you to witness not only Jacks tale, but play a major role in shaping the history of Pandora itself, along with its lonely moon. And that is a story that Marcus may gladly tell again someday.']"Kevin VanOrd,23-Mar-15,Bloodborne Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/bloodborne-review/1900-6416078/,9,PS4,"[""The beast appears, though you didn't expect it. You've never seen anything like this creature, a giant komondor dog with horns--and a former vicar of the church, apparently, evangelizing her faith by holding her paws together in prayer, then slamming them onto the ground and knocking you clear. The vicar is a microcosm of Bloodborne itself, a wondrous monstrosity that attacks you with vicious horror and religious overtones until you submit to it. Even should you rise above its terrors, Bloodborne answers to no master. Instead, you come to an agreement with it: You allow it to invade your brain and demand your concentration, and it allows you to wake from inevitable death, reminding you with each resurrection that life is a gift."", ""I know: such hyperbole! Yet this is the language of Bloodborne, a Dark Souls game in all but name, and one that introduces new themes and story motifs that cannot be overlooked. Dark Souls and its direct sequel allowed their sights, sounds, and swordplay to tell the most vital tales, relegating backstory to atmospheric tapestries that revealed their details only if you looked closely enough. Bloodborne is not short of mysteries, but its narrative beats are inescapable, and its Christian themes are undeniable. The Souls games led you through parishes and cathedrals, but never have they made such grandiose statements with their subject matter. Now, developer From Software has crafted an extravagant religious parable that mirrors its game's death-and-resurrection mechanics."", ""The allegory isn't subtle: This is a third-person action role-playing game (or role-playing action game, depending on your view) featuring a cleric and a vicar among its bosses. Outside of this clear theming, the developing saga comes to life through the sights and sounds of its world. One of Bloodborne's many striking images is that of a massive crucified figure surrounded by single-minded worshipers which poison you when they attack. The low, grumbling hum of their chant is as terrifying as their unwavering focus on their deity. Once I discovered a surreptitious way to view their worship from above, I would sneak in just to bathe in the bizarre beauty of the scene. Bloodborne sucks the faith, hope, and charity from religious devotion, populating its world with grotesque disciples and forcing the meek into their homes, from where they hope for the church to cleanse the world of its woes."", 'This isn\'t a high-minded reading of Bloodborne\'s story, which is none too nuanced. In fact, the lack of thematic nuance is what makes From Software\'s newly introduced storytelling spotlight as successful as it is. Bloodborne is unafraid to go big, to the extent that you may find yourself questioning if what you think is happening is really what\'s happening. The answer to that is, unequivocally, ""yes."" As Bloodborne introduces new sights and events, your suspicions become digital reality, and then the game asks you to suspend disbelief once again, rising to ridiculous heights of absurdity. That its malformed majesty works so well is Bloodborne\'s greatest feat. I wouldn\'t call its key events story twists, but rather, story detonations; Your expectations aren\'t subverted but heightened, by many orders of magnitude.', ""Oh, how I wish I could share with you the details, or at least put some dots on the page and let you connect them. These are discoveries you should make on your own in this excellent game. I offer reassurances, however, that Bloodborne has not taken From Software's template into Elder Scrolls territory. You will not find reams of short stories to read on the game's bookshelves, and you will not be flitting from one non-player character to the next looking for quests. But there are NPCs to chat with, most of whom stay hidden behind doors and respond to your knocks with whimpers for help, maniacal laughter, or tearful pledges to stay true to the church. For that matter, there are scattered pages to find and read, most of which have a simple expository message written on them, or a smidgen of history. With Bloodborne, From Software makes a few nods to modern game design tropes, but the additions are coated with a veneer of poetic surreality."", ""As with the Souls games, Bloodborne doesn't typically tell you where to go and what to do when you get there. You are given a few vague, overarching goals, but the intricately interconnected regions and pathways, along with nebulous visual cues, lead you to your destination. If you get stuck, it means you are applying video game logic to a game in which that logic doesn't apply. Those scarce lines of dialogue, and those few cutscenes, are not just for atmosphere: They're nuggets of information you should file away in your head and refer to later. And if the signs point to an action that you think violates the rules of video games, you should probably follow them, even when that action previously failed. Bloodborne speaks; It is your responsibility to listen. If an enemy descends upon you from the rafters above, it only stands to reason it must have found a way up there--and it means you can find one, too. It's contextual communication at its most sophisticated."", 'Thankfully, this world is one worth knowing, and knowing well. You spend the early hours in the city of Yharnam and its surrounding regions, which resemble 19th-century London more than they do the Souls games\' dark medieval locales. The ""werewolves in Victorian England"" setting has been done, but as any Souls player might tell you, you must move deeper into the kingdom before you you can expose its true form. It\'s difficult not to admire Bloodborne\'s artistry: the baroque carvings on its stone archways and pillars, the statues depicting the locals\' grief and suffering, and the gradual visual evolution of the game\'s hub area, which is known as Hunter\'s Dream.', ""After Bloodborne soaks you in its initial ironworks, it introduces greater graphical diversity. Dark Souls II varied its looks more often, but its regions didn't share an overarching theme: There was the lava area, and the poisonous woods, and so forth. The different places were connected by pathways, but not by a clear visual arc. Bloodborne, on the other hand, tells a story with its environments as you press onward, echoing its plot within its architecture and its enemies. You return to earlier areas to find they aren't as they once were, and the boundary between reality and nightmare becomes fuzzier with each slain boss. The way these areas join together enhance the joys of exploration. You discover a path leading from a swampy cave, which in turn guides you to a series of ladders. At the top of the final ladder, you realize where this path has taken you, and can only marvel at the brilliant way these two places, so seemingly distant from each other, are united."", ""There is a blight on this town in the form of seriously long load times and occasional frame rate foibles, both of which are a shame, given that this is the first Souls-esque game to appear on a current-generation console--and given how performance issues are one of many commonalities these games share. The frame rate jitters aren't common when you play on your own, but become more apparent when others join you for some jolly cooperation. The loading times could have been mitigated by a system that allows you to directly move between lamps you have activated, a la Dark Souls II. Lamps are Bloodborne's save points, which stand in for the Souls games' bonfires, and allow you to transport to Hunter's Dream. You cannot directly teleport from one lamp to another, however: You must always travel to the Dream first, meaning that quick travel requires you to endure not one, but two 30-second loading screens."", ""Your patience is a price worth paying. Bloodborne is rewarding to play, impressive both in how it cribs from the Souls games as well as in how it deviates from them. Your Souls combat skills apply to Bloodborne, but only to a certain extent. If you relied on a shield to defend you in the past, you won't find the paltry plank you find to be of much use to you. The game demands mobility, not hardiness. Your first steps into the streets of Yharnam lead you to roaming squads of ravaged dogs and torch-bearing cultists, some of whom wield firearms, and whose shots not only damage you, but stagger you as well. Avoidance is imperative, lest a quartet of mutts tear your flesh apart while leaving you powerless to slash your way out of danger."", ""Yet slashing away is a compelling response, due to Bloodborne's health regain system. Should you take damage, you have a limited time to gain some of that lost vitality by landing hits of your own. This system may strike you as incompatible with the rhythms of typical Souls combat, but it's a wonderful fit in Bloodborne for the way it complements not just your own mobility, but that of your enemies. You see, your foes are just as agile--even the hulking gluttons that descend upon you in Boodborne's boss battles. Boss arenas are typically large, affording you plenty of room to escape the wrath of the indescribable horror staring you down--and affording that horror the same luxury. Circle-strafing can no longer be your default strategy when a massive colossus proves more limber than you."", 'Avoidance is imperative, lest a quartet of mutts tear your flesh apart while leaving you powerless to slash your way out of danger.', 'These might seem like small adjustments to the formula, but they change the way you apply fundamental skills. For instance, my former lock-on habits no longer led to consistent success--not when a trio of lithe hunters zipped about the boneyard, or when a slobbering monster impossibly leaped through the air and slid across the ground like a chimerical ice dancer. Not only does an energetic enemy make it difficult to keep control of the camera when locked on, but you do not tumble when you are locked onto your target--you only sidestep or backstep. That brute covers more ground in one step than you do in several, so you unlock the camera and rush away, putting the necessary space between you and your quarry.', 'Other gameplay elements further complement the athleticism. You can carry a firearm in your left hand, for starters, though it makes for a poor offensive tool, not just because it is tuned more for staggering enemies than for damaging them, but because ammunition is a finite resource--you can only carry 20 bullets with you as a rule, and some weapons fire more than one projectile at a time. There is no spell-spamming equivalent in Bloodborne, though a rifle or blunderbuss makes a fine accompaniment to whatever blade you wield in your right hand. That melee weapon, by the way, is transformable. A cleaver is great for doing close, rapid damage, but its secondary mode extends its reach at the cost of speed--and transforming during active battle delivers a third type of attack as the weapon morphs from one state to the other.', ""There is great flexibility among the available weapons, and when I purchased a new sword from the ghoulish vendor station in Hunter's Dream, I found myself switching between the initial cleaver and the larger alternative, upgrading them both with the bloodstones I looted from certain downed enemies, and further enhancing them with blood gems, another valuable resource. In time, I disregarded firearms and relied on my sword in its two-handed form, transforming when gunmen on ledges and slithering snakes required a different approach. As expected, Bloodborne can be brutal--not as hard as Dark Souls or Demon's Souls, but a step above Dark Souls II in its level of difficulty. Mastery requires properly reacting to enemy behavior, understanding how much space you must put between you and your prey, and knowing when--and when not--to exploit health regeneration."", ""Bloodborne also takes the survival horror aspects of its close cousins to new heights. Some enemies aren't terrifying just because of their size or their power, but because of the hideous sounds they make, and the shocking entrances that jolt you out of your trance. Crows lurk in corners in groups of four or five, covering the ground with their black wings, and emitting heinous squawks as they thrash about. A deranged disciple breaks through a boarded doorway with a repulsive scream--and what was that figure that just dashed past the doorway ahead? For that matter, what is that monstrosity clinging to the chapel walls whose immense head follows you as you jog past? Bloodborne seeks to disturb you, a goal it succeeds at the first time you cleave a wheelchair-bound gunner."", ""You find quiet and calm in Hunter's Dream, where you stock up on supplies and speak to a living doll who assists you in leveling up while lulling you with her dulcet tones. As in the Souls games, you earn Bloodborne's primary resource by slaying enemies, though instead of gathering souls, you gather blood echoes. In exchange for echoes, the sweet-voiced doll allows you to improve basic attributes. There are fewer such attributes here than there are in Dark Souls, though each one's purpose isn't entirely clear when you begin your adventure. (Don't worry: with time comes understanding.) You can also spend blood echoes on practical items, with blood vials topping the list of necessities. These are your healing draughts, of which you can usually hold 20 at a time, and store 99 others in your stash for safekeeping. Some enemies drop vials when you slaughter them, but Hunter's Dream holds an infinite supply for purchase, so you can go farming for blood if you like, though it isn't strictly necessary."", ""Some enemies aren't just just terrifying because of their size or their power, but because of the hideous sounds they make, and the shocking entrances that jolt you out of your trance."", ""Nevertheless, repetition is on the Bloodborne menu, along with the blood of your sworn enemies. (How appropriate, given the game's Biblical subject matter: you drink their blood in remembrance of their sacrifice.) From Software continues to break the rules of video game adventuring to fantastic effect, killing you again and again, and inspiring you to venture into the same territory in hope of regaining the blood echoes that stain the ground where you lost them. You cannot always retrieve them through a stain, however: Sometimes, you must defeat the creature that previously bested you if you want your precious blood echoes returned to you. Otherwise, those echoes are lost to the digital ether--and so the story goes, forcing you to choose whether to press onward and risk losing your souls so you can see the next imposing vista, or to settle for the ones you have and return to Hunter's Dream, and allowing the game to gain the upper hand in your precarious partnership."", ""There are other partnerships to make. You see other Bloodborne players as spirits roaming in your own world, and can activate grave markers that play back the last few seconds of other adventurers' final moments. In both life and death, other players provide cues to upcoming dangers. Do you notice ghostly figures swinging their weapons with abandon, even when there is no apparent danger? You should reexamine your assumptions: Those apparitions are warning you of imminent attack. You can also drop spectral messages on the ground, alerting other players to traps--and how I wish someone had done so when I stepped on a pressure plate and a sturdy log swung into my face. These aspects of Bloodborne are less novel than they were when they appeared in Demon's Souls, but they are still a vital component of Bloodborne's success, giving rise to a sense of community even when you don't directly interact with other players. You are part of an expansive web of worlds, each one shining a spot of sun into the others."", ""There are direct interactions in the form of direct cooperation: Ringing the right bell in your inventory either summons a helper into your world, or signals your availability to others. Now that I have finished Bloodborne, this is how I am conquering the new-game-plus: My partner distracts the dreadful Cleric Beast so that I may bury my sword into the creature's flesh. Joining up this way also makes you vulnerable to invasion from other players, a heart-rending twist that has you glancing in multiple directions, looking for signs of the real-life hunter that joins the AI-controlled creatures that hope to end you."", ""These multiplayer components are also available in Bloodborne's Chalice Dungeons, which are adventuring areas--many of which are procedurally generated--that you enter by performing a ritual at one of Hunter's Dream's available headstones. Standalone dungeons are a neat idea, but you can't enjoy them without caveats. There are specific bosses in there to defeat, such as a humongous flaming watchdog, but if you don't periodically perform new chalice rituals, you can outlevel the ones available to you and breeze through them in a matter of minutes--not much fun in a game whose primary draw is the tension it creates through challenge. I also encountered numerous bugs within, getting stuck in place twice when approaching a glowing orb representing loot to pillage, and running into an issue with boss behavior."", ""The finest treasures are found within the city of Yharnam and the forests, lakes, and purgatories beyond it. Only Bloodborne would be so bold as to bury an entire factional player-versus-player mechanic within an optional region, which is in turn buried within a series of oblique steps you might miss if you aren't exploring every nook and cranny, or ignore the game's enigmatic hints. I finished Bloodborne in less time than I did Dark Souls II, yet I treasure it more in spite of its few missteps. In death there is life, and in blood, there is redemption. More hyperbole, yes, but for a game this theatrical, only hyperbole will do.""]"Cameron Woolsey,20-Mar-15,Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/borderlands-the-pre-sequel-claptastic-voyage-revie/1900-6416074/,6,PC,"[""In Claptastic Voyage, you learn that there is more inside Claptrap's rusted head than bugs, dubstep remixes, and horrible loneliness. Nestled deep in his chrome dome lies a particular MacGuffin desired by Jack above all: the H-Source, a powerful code, used to unlock Hyperion's greatest assets, such as badass weapons. Without other options, Jack digitizes his chosen vault hunters, sending them into Claptrap's mind. They do battle against vicious bugs and viruses, all the while exorcising some of Claptrap's inner demons. The story occurs after the events of Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, and at last explains how the plucky robot goes from accomplished vault hunter to fending off bullymongs in the frozen wastelands of Borderlands 2. But where Claptastic Voyage excels, such as in its new enemies and awesome glitched weapons, it stumbles in mission design, leading you along one dull fetch quest after another, even though a surprising change of scenery helps alleviate the mounting boredom."", ""Nevertheless, the first few hours of the pack are a bit of a chore, as you travel through Claptrap's consciousness and memories hunting down needed objects. One of your earliest tasks is to scavenge for broken pieces of a bridge so you can continue. The stereotypical obstacles cause the quest to march on at a sluggish pace, and during the moments when a lack of real progress causes Jack to sigh in frustration over the intercom, I began to understand how he felt. After all, what is less exciting than a fetch quest within what is technically one large fetch quest?"", 'The environments in which you tackle these early bits are a bit of a drag as well. Sure, there is that warm swelling of nostalgia when you first enter Claptrap\'s memories of Pandora\'s rustic Fyrestone, complete with cameos of broken holographic characters such as Dr. Zed who offer guidance. However, it is merely a brief distraction, as if to inquire, ""Hey, remember this?"" before ushering you onward with your dreary item hunt. I understand that this is merely a broken memory and little else. But as the quest inched onward, I longed for those old Borderlands days when Fyrestone was like an ""Old Western"" town in which to stock up on supplies, chat up the locals, and grab new missions (accompanied by that lovely acoustic soundtrack), instead of being just a brief distraction.', ""Thankfully, the game does loosen up some as you move along. As you venture deeper into Claptrap's consciousness, the broken memories of former Pandora, the structures made of neon lights and steel, and even the black hexagonal skies are brushed away. They are replaced with bright pink-orange hues, clouds, and floating islands, not unlike anything out of BioShock Infinite. Go deeper still, and you stumble into something akin to M.C. Escher, with waterfalls flowing from floor to ceiling and staircases on the walls leading to nowhere. It's a striking visual contrast with the cold interiors that first greet you. Claptastic Voyage deserves some credit in refusing to stick to one type of aesthetic, adding an appreciated splash of whimsy to the mind of our dubstep-loving robot. The main story itself revolves around running about searching for keys or other precious objects, but at least the landscape becomes fascinating enough to serve as a nice distraction from the tedium."", ""The electric combat that I loved so much about the gravity-defying Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel also helps to put a charge into this short digital adventure. New enemies come in the form of glowing bugs and glitches, sharp-angled foes that attack in swarms and phase in and out of existence. Worse, however, are computer viruses, able to adapt to the elemental effects of your weapons. These foreign invaders are tough, but they provide some engrossing confrontations, with flying bolts of energy turning every battle into an industrious light show. It's doubtful you'll soon grow weary of blasting these nasty baddies, and you have plenty of opportunities to fight enemies from high in the air or butt-slam them into sparkly digital bits. You must also tackle Claptrap's own immune system, manifested as insecurity bots, robotic guard dogs, turrets, and more."", ""You won't always find yourself against one group of enemy types at a time. Scenes become chaotic as bugs and viruses clash with Claptrap's defense troops. If you find yourself being overwhelmed, you can look to the skies for volatile bits, floating lazily while switching colors between pink and green. Shooting one while it's green sends a barrage of corrosive missiles at nearby enemies, while pink gives you a welcome health boost. You find yourself caught in many encounters where these bits make a huge difference in whether you go down for the count or continue the fight."", ""Claptastic Voyage features a new peculiar weapon type, one that is about as mixed up as Claptrap himself. Glitched weapons, typically recognizable by their sheen of flowing ones and zeros, flicker wildly, randomly changing their behavior. For example, by default a glitched weapon glows with a soft blue and doesn't act out of the norm, but with a flash to green, it's suddenly imbued with a scatter shot. When yellow, it fires nonstop until you reload or switch weapons, and when red, it shaves colossal chunks of health off enemies. I must admit: glitched weapons are easily my favorite component of this pack. They add a flare of unpredictability to every battle, allowing you to change tactics at any moment. One of my favorite weapons was a glitched laser gun, which performed admirably against single enemies, but not so well against multiple targets, forcing me to turn heel or leap away before getting overpowered. But in some of those fights, with a sudden shudder the gun turns green--once a rifle, now a rapid-fire shotgun--and allows me to turn back to lay waste to the pursuing army of hapless bugs and viruses. It is just so satisfying."", ""But not everything about Claptastic Voyage is equally as rewarding--and here I'm referring to the pack's extra content. Finishing the main quest opens up the mutator arena, offering loot if you survive three waves of enemies. Before starting, you can choose a game mode, such as half gravity, a difficulty--the higher you go the better chance for rarer loot--and a game modifier, which includes increasing butt-slam damage or increasing reload speed and likelihood of ammo drops for the rocket launcher while also decreasing its damage. The arena fights are not all that engaging, however, and I quickly decided that the chance of rare loot wasn't worth the effort."", 'It also doesn\'t help that the arena\'s two hosts, a racially insensitive hot dog and a bored cat with a perpetual birthday, are incessantly annoying. Now, you would perhaps believe this has the makings of comedy gold, but in reality, no--it does not. The scripts for these two could have used some brushing up, as the unlikely duo often try too hard to be edgy and funny all at once. And hearing the hot dog shout ""Treat \'em like Truxicans crossin\' the border!"" is not only aggravating after the tenth time, but also strays too close to being actually offensive. That, mixed with lousy hot dog puns and the cat\'s bored phrases interspersed with ""meow,"" meant I found myself looking forward to the end of the third wave just so I didn\'t have to hear them anymore. I just...I just really miss Mr. Torgue.', ""Not all of the extras are bad, but they also aren't particularly thrilling, either. Some of the side missions that appear following the story are, again, more fetch quests whose prizes arent worthy of the time spent going back and forth to complete them. There are some standouts, though, such as helping Claptrap live out his hidden fantasy as a caped superhero or getting him in touch with his, ahem, more feminine side. Claptastic Voyage also comes equipped with the Ultimate Vault Hunter Upgrade Pack 2--this increases the level cap from 60 to 70, which means 10 more skill points for your chosen vault hunter."", ' ', ""Claptastic Voyage, much like our dear Claptrap himself, is an imperfect little thing. But it's still decent thanks to Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel's outstanding combat formula and some superb environments revealed as you delve further into the story. The adventure is a lengthy one, coming in at around 10 hours with the main quest and side missions complete--though that time should vary depending on your vault hunter's level. Yes, this is the end of Claptrap the mighty vault hunter, and though Claptastic Voyage could have been a better sendoff for his implausible profession, at least we know that his story will continue onward for some time to come. So long as there aren't any stairs in the way.""]"Justin Clark,19-Mar-15,Woolfe - The Red Hood Diaries Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/woolfe-the-red-hood-diaries-review/1900-6416073/,4,PC,"[""A game like Woolfe: The Red Hood Diaries was inevitable in a media landscape where a grim-and-gritty reboot is as common as films shot in color and in focus. That doesn't make another example of this trend an inherently bad thing, but the pitfalls of such an approach are numerous, and Woolfe provides a harsh lesson in how to fall into all of them."", 'The pratfalling starts early as our heroine, an axe-wielding, platinum-haired, Amy Brown-meets-Assassins Creed-styled Red Riding Hood, states, ""This is no fairy tale, because nothing here is fair. She could\'ve been warning everyone about the game\'s combat, but she\'s actually referring to the bustling city of Ulrica, which is currently falling to ruin at the hands of B.B. Wolfe, a steampunk Daniel Plainview who industrializes the tiny village and needn\'t associate with the unwashed masses again. Wolfe then puts the whole place under martial law enforced by an army of murderous tin soldiers designed by Red\'s father. After Red\'s father dies and her mother goes missing, Red, under the strict tutelage of her grandmother, takes it upon herself to infiltrate Woolfe\'s businesses and find the truth.', 'The pitfalls of such an approach are numerous, and Woolfe provides a harsh lesson in how to fall into all of them.', ""The elephant in the room must be acknowledged here, and it's named American McGee. The game feels like a story that'd be right in that designer's wheelhouse--and in fact, McGees game Akaneiro has already pursued the Red Riding Hood theme. (Tale of Tales The Path should also be acknowledged for having trod this ground as well, and with great style to boot.) Woolfe does look and act the part. The architecture and atmosphere of Ulrica are marvels of ruined, washed-out, Victorian splendor, with disorienting, flashy clockwork technology intrusively laid over it. This look is intentional, and it tells the story of this place much better than Red does. The impressive lighting effects in the town and forest only enhance it by imbuing everything with a natural magic, contrasting with the ruin instead of clashing with it. This is, in fact, the same marvel American McGee accomplished with the Alice games."", 'Alice and Alice: Madness Returns work not because they overwrite Lewis Carroll but because they expound upon it. The young Alice in Carroll\'s story is found insane in the real world, and her being surrounded by mental illness influences the changes in Wonderland. It\'s an organic blossoming of classic ideas into something darker, and it requires a sure hand to pull it offone that Woolfe doesn\'t have. Instead, Woolfe settles for a lazy shorthand of fairy tale tropes but lacks the foresight to introduce any measure or promise of joy or catharsis worth running, jumping, or fighting for. The greed of the Big Bad Wolf is reduced to corporate greed. The sadness of a father forced to make toy soldiers into a real, unyielding military never has enough of a foundation in good times to stick. Red herself speaks in a mix of sub-Buffy the Vampire Slayer modern teenage one-liners and broken, self-loathing pseudo-poetry. Its a mess, needlessly dour and ""edgy"" for its own sake, an immature approach to subversive reimagining. The exhilaration starts and stops with the art design.', 'Red herself speaks in a mix of sub-Buffy the Vampire Slayer modern teenage one-liners and broken, self-loathing pseudo-poetry.', ""When the game leaves story behind in favor of player interaction, it involves competent platforming and puzzle solving with a small measure of 3D movement and backtracking, but its still fairly linear. It's also wholly unremarkable, marred by a score of tiny and annoying but not game-breaking bugs. A puzzle on the second stage requires Red to perform a relatively simple shimmy along a set of pipes to jump across a gap before being drowned in a pile of sludge from above; this stranded me 20 minutes longer than it should have because the game refused to recognize and grasp the pipes on the other side. Long stretches of running from enemies are aggravating because Red snags herself on the edges of walls."", ""Combat is rather boring to begin with, with a light attack, heavy attack, and two magical attacks. Nothing works more effectively than just spamming heavy attack ad nauseum, especially at the frequent moments when hits don't register, which is especially frustrating in sections involving an evil Pied Piper who summons groups of rats. A ground pound attack, which is supposed to make quick work of the horde, rarely connects in the way you think it will, and the group can chip away at Red's energy far faster than she can readjust and aim for whatever's attacking her. Boss fights compound all these issues, with scripted events all suffering from occasional moments of glitchy failure."", ""Woolfe barely comes into its own before it's over, with the entire game taking about 23 hours tops. It's apparently only half of a two-part experience, but the halfway mark of the game doesn't show much promise for the second. Adult takes on childrens' stories are a hard balancing act, and the moral of this particular take is perhaps in showing just how much a storyteller has to grow up to get it right.""]"Josiah Renaudin,19-Mar-15,Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/robot-roller-derby-disco-dodgeball-review/1900-6416070/,6,PC,"['Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball is a fast and lively arcade playground, marinated in neon shades and seared by the hottest techno tunes. The lights pulsate as the bass bumps, the colors shift as the action swells, and, somehow, your movement seems to synchronize with the chaos painting the map. This competitive PC arena experience is teeming with character, but with its overly loose controls and absence of meaningful progression, the game pushes its style over its substance. Like disco itself, the enjoyment provided by Disco Dodgeballs vibrant walls is fleeting, fading like a fad forgotten not long after its initial boom.', 'It fails to make a lasting impression, but that doesnt stop the action from being gripping and entertaining early on. Robots roll on a single wheel up and down the various maps--resembling dance floors with their vivacious lights--while explosive dodge balls whizz by your head. Power-ups transform your projectiles into boomerangs and provide jetpacks mid-round, so its critical to keep your eyes on both the position of your opposition and these enhancements. Blasting opponents out of the air or pelting an unsuspecting robot with a ricocheted ball is supremely satisfying, but learning how and when to take a shot isnt easy. Youre riding on a wheel against a surface providing little friction, so everyone on the dance floor continues to roll long after letting off the gas. Balls arc downward after being thrown and bounce off walls in often unexpected ways, so it takes a great deal of practice to understand how, when, and where to take a shot with so many variables at play.', 'Multiplayer games are player-hosted, so a high ping can result in robots flying from one end of the screen to the other as if hurled from a catapult; as a result, the already fast movement speed--which is only enhanced by a rechargeable boost--can be a little too sporadic to account for. Theres nothing wrong with combat that takes time to master, but even after hours of play, I never felt fully comfortable with the direction of my explosive shots.', 'Thankfully, theres more to Disco Dodgeball than just throwing and catching balls. Beyond the classic Elimination and Deathmatch options, modes like Hoops and Grand Prix offer unique, interesting ways of playing with the mechanics. Hoops forces you to focus on fitting a specific ball through a square goal in order to score points for your team, while Grand Prix transforms the map into a speedway of sorts. Instead of using your momentum to dodge oncoming action, you must barrel through checkpoints as you race against the competition. Catching and throwing balls always remains a significant piece of the puzzle, but these various mechanical alterations allow for much greater in-game creativity that what the standard rules supply. Most servers lean toward the classic modes, but mixing up the rules within a room full of competent bots is always an option.', 'Once the early wonder starts to wear off, though, whats left is a fun curiosity with hooks too dull to pierce the skin. Theres single-player content, including Arcade, Horde, Training, and a handful of other solo affairs, but the real appeal here is the competitive play. Leaderboards and the ability to level up provide some incentive to come back, but other than basic robot customization, the actual tangible rewards for continuing to play the game are weak. Without a true sense of progression, Disco Dodgeball doesnt do much to pull you back onto its thumping dance floors.', 'When the connection is strong, the balls are bouncing as you intend, and there are enough players to populate the servers, Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball is a treat. The audiovisual package superbly complements the wall-to-wall mayhem found within a competitive round, and theres a healthy suite of modes to mix up the action. Theres just not enough staying power, and controls that are a few notches too loose make it difficult to determine a shots trajectory. Disco Dodgeball is a creative player in a crowded space, but lacks too many attributes to stand out.']"Nick Capozzoli,19-Mar-15,Frozen Cortex Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/frozen-cortex-review/1900-6416072/,7,PC,"['A pneumatic leg slams into a neon breastplate, dislodging a ball with curious, flattened sides--futuristic-looking in that characteristically impractical sort of way, like a concept car with inaccessible wheel wells. Its a turnover in favor of Sporting Automata, and one of its robots lumbers into the phosphorescent glow of the end zone, where it spikes the ball and does a few celebratory sit-ups.', ""This is Cortex, an object lesson in a brand of futurism that's surprisingly hard to come by in the world of electronic sports. Its gridiron is littered with extruded geometries and embossed with cosmetic circuitry patterns. Broad-shouldered athlete-simulacra smash into each other like promo animations for the NFL on FOX as their head coach/Matrix operators look on, bottom-lit by monitor glow. It's a wildly speculative vision of what sports could one day be. Its the kind of thing you used to see a lot more of earlier in the digital era, and a far cry from the current tack of e-sports with its gently iterative shooters and fighting games."", 'Frozen Cortex\'s other hereditary through-line runs straight back to football. In a planning phase prior to any action, two players simultaneously slip step-by-step instructions to their team of five robots, setting up running routes, passes, blocks, or zone coverage. The goal is to score by reaching the thin strip of the end zone or crossing smaller ""extra point"" tiles strewn across the randomly generated maps. Waypoints can be laid down with simple clicks of the mouse, and a bot will faithfully trace a direct route through them to the end of its line. With a full set of paths and nodes diagrammed out for the five robots, the traditional playmaking Xs and Os here begin to take on the look of an electrical schematic, and its easy to imagine some subsequent Frozen Cortex 16 version introducing stutter-step resistors and spin-move inductors, or maybe a ""battery"" symbol for a stiff-arm to the face.', 'A lot of Frozen Cortexs tactical potency is owed to the fact that it allows players to sketch out and demo their opponents game plan exactly as if it were their own. Its a subtly brilliant little inclusion that opens up the opportunity to tailor-make counters to highly specific plays. Of course, the awareness that your opponent can just as easily construct a 1:1 model for any play you might conjure up ends up bleeding into your strategic subconscious, too. Against a well-versed player, a match of Cortex becomes an exercise in recursion: ""Theyll be expecting the obvious pass--but theyll also be expecting that I expect that they expect the obvious pass. But then again...""', 'You can imagine the effect this can have on turn length. Outside of a specialized mode with a thirty-second play clock, players can take as long as they want--days, even--to submit their move. But its all well accounted for in Frozen Cortexs elegant matchmaking system, which allows you to field multiple games simultaneously and even enable email notifications in case your turn comes up while youre away. While the server population never seems to stretch beyond thirty players at a given time, games are easy enough to come by. The measured, deliberate pace seems to attract a crowd that\'s more genial than most, if sometimes prone to ""forgetting"" about your match soon after you burn them for a big score.', 'This all means that it only takes a match or two to pick up the fundamentals, which is as long as I can recommend bothering with Frozen Cortexs single-player mode.', 'With both players interpretations of the ensuing play in hand, the game crashes them into each other and films the resulting chaos like Jake Gyllenhaals creepy Nightcrawler cameraman, tailing runners with an uncomfortably narrow chase view or leaping sideways to frame the secondary getting burned on a long pass. A quibble, but its easy to lose track of a robot during these rare and irregular perspective changes, especially when a given part of the playing field so often looks like any other.', 'Learning to respect the deep ball is the first harsh lesson in the education of a Cortex player. A bot can hurl the rock from one end of the small field clear to the other--as long as there arent any tall blocks in the way--and drop it in the end zone to be caught or picked up by a nearby teammate. The longest passes freeze at their apex, ending the turn. This ostensibly allows the defense time to swoop in for an interception, but the effect is like a crystallization of that wonderful moment when an NFL cameraman begins that telltale, frantic sideways pan--the moment anyone watching suddenly realizes that somethings just gone dramatically wrong (or, less often for a Texans fan like me, right) in the backfield.', 'Unlike passes, runs draw out through the full length of a turn. True to real football, theyre the grind-it-out option, leaning on the cumulative effect of bonus point tiles for a win by attrition. Because of the idiosyncratic way that blocking works in Frozen Cortex, stopping the run requires a patient defense and timely risks. If it lapses enough to allow a robot to scamper through to the end zone after hitting a string of extra points, its a coup.', 'Two circles around each bot govern all collisions in a game chock full of them: one for blocking and one for tackling. A robot thats ""first on scene""--that is to say, reaches an area and goes stationary before the opponent does--will block any comers trying to run past its circle on their prescribed routes. But stationary bots will automatically bypass would-be blockers to snuff out ball handlers that enter their larger tackling radius. It\'s a strategic wrinkle that forgoes the random number generators so endemic to sports games in favor of something more aboveboard and ultimately more intuitive, too.', 'This all means that it only takes a match or two to pick up the fundamentals, which is as long as I can recommend bothering with Frozen Cortexs single-player mode. There are two main formats: a one-and-done ""Knockout"" mode and a standard single-season league. In league play, the AI provides stiff initial competition, but it quickly fades as you use the perfunctory free agent system to outspend it on new robots with better stats. Theres an overarching text-based narrative involving an investigation into thrown matches, but it goes nowhere fast and rings especially hollow because Frozen Cortex actually allows you to bet against your own team and throw the game without consequences.', 'It\'s weird to cite a game for trying to go deeper or tell a story. But the futuristic coating that Frozen Cortex paints over its sport works best as a surface treatment. And if you don\'t cut into it, it looks great. The teams have slick, expressive names like ""Heavy Perspective"" or ""SXT Vision,"" and their logos look like the glyph symbols in Blade that denote secret vampire rave nightclubs. The industrial electronica tracks thrum along as naturally as a pulse. A news ticker drip feeds evocative little blurbs like ""Core 4 Teams to Meet with WRC and League to Discuss Player Rights."" It\'s only in the actual exposition that these things end up belabored, as the league\'s talking heads try to pack an entire personality into each of the tweet-sized messages they send before each match.', ""Maybe that's a mark in favor of replacing the human element in futuristic games like this. If you could only excise all those flimsy, unreliable human bodies, with their proclivities for head trauma and contract renegotiation demands, you'd perhaps reach something purer--sport ascended from the flesh, so to speak. Bigger but more thoughtful. Gladiatorial but safe. With blitzes that play out like chess, with mechanized athletes that can pull any move if you can just hit the right combination of buttons. Some ultimate game where nerd and jock fuse together and assume their final form.""]"Justin Clark,19-Mar-15,Bladestorm: The Hundred Years' War Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/bladestorm-nightmare-review/1900-6416071/,5,PS4,"[""Somewhere in the world, there's a 14-year-old in an interminable high school history class who, just to stay awake, is probably imagining a scenario that looks a lot like Bladestorm: Nightmare. The Hundred Years' War is one of the longest and most pointless conflicts in human history, memorable primarily for Joan of Arc's involvement and as the basis for hundreds of years of Brits and the French throwing shade at each other, with decades upon decades of grousing about kings and succession happening in between. Surely, such a memory can only be improved by imagining the war being fought by anime-haired mercenaries commanding legions of sellswords to slay massive armored knights, vicious dragons, and snarling armies of demons, right?"", ""On paper, that's a yes, and I wish the folks at Tecmo Koei were capable of doing it justice. Instead, Bladestorm's pretension of being a massive scale real-time strategy game with action elements turns out to be little more than a European coat of paint slathered over the tired Musou formula, with the RTS elements working to its detriment instead of providing much needed fun and depth. At least the game gives you a lot to work with. Bladestorm Nightmare is a remaster and a sequel all in one. The original game, released in 2007, is included here with a few new features to bring it up to par with the new scenario, Nightmare, which totals out to anywhere from 25 to 30 hours of gameplay, all told. If nothing else, it at least succeeds in keeping you busy."", ""Staying busy in the Hundred Years' War scenario involves making a mercenary in the game's fairly deep character creator to lead specialized troops--swords, spears, archers, and the like--into the fray of the ongoing war between the British and the French. Just as in the Warriors games, your job is to go from enemy base to enemy base, clearing out hordes of enemy combatants and their generals, lowering their defenses to nothing until the base commander shows. Killing him or her means that your side sets up shop in the base, and the enemy has fewer reinforcements to prevent you from taking out the big target on the map and clearing the stage."", ""While there's at least a measure of flash and flair to the ongoing march to war in the Warriors games, Bladestorm tries to throw an RTS twist into the mix, in which you don't directly control one single, legendary fighter, but an entire squad that swarms enemies at the push of a button. Special moves are powerful, but they all have a cool down period, meaning that each coordinated move has to be planned carefully. You also have the ability to pair up with another mercenary--either by switching back and forth at the push of a button or via online cooperation, both of which are new features in this version--and you can strategize your attack to leave enemies trapped in massive walls of zealotry and death."", ""Bladestorm's pretension of being a massive scale real-time strategy game with action elements turns out to be little more than a European coat of paint slathered over the tired Musou formula."", ""Though you could do that, chances are pretty good that it's unnecessary. Despite a slew of strategic features and options, generally any squad of any weapon can walk right up to any group of enemies, start slashing, and walk away no worse for wear. There is, ostensibly, a strength/weakness system in which specific weapons are more effective on certain squads than others, but aside from occasional trouble with troops on horseback when you're at a lower level, the chances of your squad being wiped out entirely are slim, especially since you can always retreat from battle to your nearest base, round up a new squad, and take another shot. Failure ends up being a virtual impossibility the further you go, since the enemy AI is profoundly awful. I have literally left the game unpaused to take a phone call, with my squad standing ten feet from a group of enemies, and not had the enemies take a single swipe the whole time. That's a characteristic of Warriors as well, but the fun of stringing together insane, crowd-slaying combos against nigh-defenseless masses is non-existent in a game in which all combat boils down to holding a button until damage numbers stop popping up."", ""Once upgrades start coming into play, enemies stop being a factor altogether, and pretty much exist just to be cannon fodder. The tavern, which serves as an ersatz base of operations, allows you to level up each squad's attack, defense, and item frequency, as well as giving you the opportunity to select variants with special powers. The variations are actually fairly extensive, which would be delightful if you didn't have the ability to sail through the game using just your hard earned points to buy attack and defense upgrades, never touching the rest. Instead, your enemy most often ends up being the clock, which times every stage at ten minutes, and stops the fighting no matter how much progress you've made. This would not be such a big deal if traveling from enemy base to enemy base didn't usually take two to three minutes, but even on horseback, you still face long stretches of riding through endless unchanging countryside looking for fights."", ""Aside from occasional trouble with troops on horseback when you're at a lower level, the chances of your squad being wiped out entirely are slim."", ""The tavern and the loading screens provide most of the story, which also ends up being a wash. There's plenty of detail to be mined out of 100 years of war, and the game hits on the highlights, with major figures like Edward the Black Prince, Gilles De Rais, and of course, Joan of Arc all making cameo appearances. The historical highlights are, unfortunately, utterly disconnected from the gameplay. As a mercenary, you're allowed to choose which side of each battle you want to fight on, and no matter how much work you put into claiming territory for one side or the other, the cutscenes still generally ignore your progress in favor of the real event. So all your time spent in taverns, chatting up other mercenaries and a bartender with the worst excuse for a French accent this side of Eddie Izzard's Bond-Villain-With-Broken-Translator skit ultimately makes absolutely no difference to the story."", ""Does the Nightmare scenario change any of this? Somewhat. It does introduce a more varied throng of enemies than the Hundred Years' War, with magicians, dragons, and snarly goblins. You're allowed to carry over your mercenaries from the Hundred Years' War, and if you owned the original game on PS3, you can import your character from that version. The difficulty level is kicked up a minor notch, so you might actually catch the occasional beatdown if you're not a bit more careful at first. The ten minute time restriction is eliminated in favor of a more dynamic system of shifting objectives, fake enemies, and a map that actually expands as more enemies make their appearance. So, yes, for what it's worth, Nightmare is a better game than the original. However, the core gameplay hasn't been touched, and turning Joan of Arc into an anime villain--who probably-not-coincidentally bears a more than passing resemblance to Cia from Hyrule Warriors--just makes the scenario into a strange Soul Calibur RTS, rather than doing anything interesting with France's beloved Maid selling her soul to stop a war."", 'Bladestorm: Nightmare is a game trapped in 2007, awkwardly fumbling for a way to push a tried and true formula forward. The ideas are appreciable, but not nearly enough of the required effort has been put in to make this game great or even challenging. Somewhere, a history student is daydreaming of a Hundred Years War full of magic, danger, wild-haired mercenaries, and insane alternate histories in which Joan of Arc becomes witch mistress of Europe. Whatever that kid has in mind, it is certain to be more ambitious than what Bladestorm: Nightmare can provide.']"Jason Venter,17-Mar-15,LA Cops Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/la-cops-review/1900-6416069/,3,Xbox One,"[""The best video games get better the more you play them. You start with a rough understanding of how everything works, and gradually you find yourself triumphing against mounting odds, until finally, you're a finely-tuned weapon capable of cutting through any mess to save the day. The experience such games offer is exhilarating, rewarding, and fair--and everything LA Cops is not."", ""After a brief tutorial, LA Cops begins with a cutscene that shows a cop finding a wedding ring and a note on a counter. You can piece together what that means, and may feel sorry for the officer, who was so married to his job that his wife decided to find a new husband. Then it's time to pick two officers from a squad of six before you tackle an isometric shooting stage. Your job is to neutralize some gang members who have taken the owner of a donut shop hostage. Collateral damage is okay."", 'The game picks inopportune times to worry about realism.', 'LA Cops is not a long game. It features eight story-based missions, along with an assortment of challenging secondary stages that become available as you clear the primary eight. You can repeat any scenario you like, as often as suits you, on any of three available difficulty settings. Objectives vary from one job to the next, but mostly you need to slowly work your way through a stage, slapping cuffs on goons or--more frequently--blasting them to bits and leaving blood smears on the walls and floor. The former action rewards you with more points, but makes for a tedious and risky progression, since you spend a lot of time running through rooms occupied by several alert gang members at a time.', ""The game picks inopportune times to worry about realism. At the onset, taking a hit means that your officer is quite likely dead. He drops to the floor in a huge pool of blood, and control shifts immediately to the second officer. Generally, you can find a first-aid kit somewhere in the area that allows for one revival, and there are donuts lying around (apparently, the five-second rule doesn't apply) that you can use to restore health if somehow you take damage and live to tell the tale, but it's best to assume that a single mistake is fatal."", 'Additional missions are a chore, not a reward.', ""Unfortunately, the game is built so that mistakes are inevitable. Sprawling environments mean you can almost never see as far as you need to, even if you pull the camera out as far as it can go. This adds tension (which is good) while allowing for some really cheap moments (which are bad). Shoot a lone guard in the corridor ahead of you, but don't start forward just yet because the sound of your shot might cause another guard--or five, or six--to emerge from adjoining rooms with murder on their minds. Such events never happen consistently because, while enemy placement is approximately the same every time you attempt a stage, guards make the rounds in random patterns. Progression at the speed of a crawl is all but required in the later stages, even once you think you're familiar with everything, since getting rushed by a few men at once is dangerous, even if you expect it and back away into a room you've already cleared."", ""On your first few trips through a stage, you also get to discover all sorts of neat surprises. A wall looks solid, so you creep along in search of your next threat, only to get gunned down because, actually, someone saw you through a window that you weren't aware existed. You find out about that on your next attempt, when it may or may not factor into the course of the game at all. Or maybe you're caught in a shootout and a bullet hits a propane tank, explodes, and vaporizes you. That's all part of the learning process."", 'Everything looks good enough to provide a sense of place, but minimalism is the order of the day.', ""The fact that you have a partner is supposed to make the rigmarole easier to handle, but it doesn't. Technically, you can set up ambushes and work as a team. Any time you like, you can switch from one officer to the other at the press of a button. Or you can invite your friend to join you by pointing the finicky cursor to a likely spot and pressing a different button. If you time it right, a load screen tip explains, both of you can burst into a room at the same time and give your adversaries hell. In theory, this is wonderful, and adds depth to the game. In practice, it doesnt work. The timing is touchy, for one thing, but a bigger issue is your ally's tendency to get gunned down the minute he's spotted by anyone. The bad guys always seem to shoot first, unless you lure them around a corner where your partner is positioned and he happens to feel ambitious. Except in rare cases, your backup works better as a second life than as a means of getting more juice out of the first one."", ""Character customization is offered, and you might suppose it would impact how everything plays out, but it doesn't, really. You earn two, three, or four skill points when you clear a stage, depending on your rating, and you can assign those to any officer on the force. Each character can be maxed out with 100 points that allow them to use weapons besides pistols--an all but mandatory skill in later stages--and to lengthen life meters, improve speed, expand weapon clip size, and increase the damage that bullets inflict. You have to accumulate a lot of points before you see a difference, and even then, a bullet or two is just as fatal."", 'The bad guys always seem to shoot first, unless you lure them around a corner where your partner is positioned and he happens to feel ambitious.', ""LA Cops also has problems with difficulty balance. The first four missions are a nice warm-up. They'll frustrate you if you try to rush through them, but they feel fair unless shots don't line up, which is a random but rare occurrence. Then the fifth stage is suddenly packed with goons and you have to work much harder to survive, but that's still not so bad. Next, the sixth stage comes along and presents a large area with garage doors that suddenly lift so that waves of enemies can swarm you. When you advance to the building's second floor, an action that previously activated checkpoints that you could return to as often as you wished, you are notified that failure means a trip back to the beginning of the stage. The game neglects to mention that you can keep retrying as long as the restrictive timer remains (it carries over even if you continue after both officers fall). The best strategy is thus to run through the rooms as quickly as you can, guns blazing, only the game doesn't tell you that, instead punishing you for not figuring it out in time. From then on, new stages produce extra wrinkles that are similarly exasperating. Additional missions are a chore, not a reward."", ""If the game offered meaningful incentives for triumphing over its quirks, that would go a long way toward making the play more enjoyable, but the cutscenes are too brief and disjointed to be interesting. They tell a slightly humorous story, filled with bad dialogue, making fun of 70s cop films without doing anything to improve on them. Character models are drawn just well enough that you can see them for the stereotypes they are, which could still work well if most of the characters weren't apparently voiced by one guy, who sounds disinterested in everything he says. If the soundtrack weren't so delightful and appropriate, you'd almost be better off playing with the sound muted. In the actual levels, everything looks good enough to provide a sense of place, but minimalism is the order of the day, and the splashes of crimson that result when you gun down a bunch of thugs are the most interesting thing you ever see."", ""LA Cops has the pieces that could have been used to build an interesting shooter, but they only occasionally come together. The result is a frequently maddening slog through isometric hell, framed by a broken story and sloppy mechanics, suggesting that what the game needed more than anything was further play testing and refinement. You're better off replaying something you already like that does a better job of treading similar ground, rather than enduring this cop story gone bad.""]"Peter Brown,17-Mar-15,Resident Evil: Revelations 2 Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-revelations-2-episode-four-review/1900-6416068/,7,Xbox One,"[""Resident Evil: Revelations 2's tale is coming to an end, and with it, your stint on an island overrun with biological monstrosities.

It doesn\'t take long to find the so called Overseer, whom you meet just a few minutes after Episode Four starts. ""We meet at last,"" she says, but no sooner does your meeting come to an end. Quickly, you have to sprint your way to safety as the tower collapses around you during a self-destruct sequence. Concrete and metal fall dangerously close as you race to the bottom, and apart from a few enemies--the tiresome invisible mutants from Episodes Two and Three--there\'s isn\'t much standing in your way except fate, as it turns out.', 'You arrive at a crossroads of sorts as the clock ticks down to its final seconds, but it\'s a false intersection with only one direction to take that won\'t result in a game over. This bait and switch is unfortunate, because it seems like the fate of the protagonists lies in your hands, but you don\'t actually have control over the outcome unless you\'re happy to call a ""game over"" screen an ending. The path that you\'re forced to take leads you to the inevitable conclusion of the first half of Episode Four, and though you still feel the sting of this deception as Claire and Moira\'s chapter comes to a close, another part of you is engrossed in the event that does play out. It\'s a somber moment that carries weight, especially after everything the pair have been through. More than ever, Revelations 2 commands your attention in this moment, taking an emotional toll that you won\'t soon forget.', ""When you retake the wheel as Barry, he's waking up from a dream, flashing back to the events immediately following Claire and Moira's dramatic conclusion. From here, Barry and Natalia continue their trek, and with Barry's finger on the trigger and Natalia's finger on hidden objects, it's back to business as usual. Before diving into the underground mine where your target's supposedly hiding, you need to cross a span of scaffolding, but gaps in the framework prevent you from simply waltzing across. To get to the other side, you alternate between Barry and Natalia, moving a platform from one spot to the next. It can be a tricky puzzle if you go through it on your own rather than with a partner, simply because of your limited perspective. You're always standing on the lower level whenever you pull a switch to move the platform, and this angle makes it easy to miss the movement of the platform overhead, which also shifts with every pull of a switch. Recognizing this behavior is the key to solving the puzzle, and while it's simple in theory, you may miss it in practice."", ""When you eventually make it across and into the depths of the mine, you're up against a thick layer of poisonous mist, in addition to the usual parade of zombies, who crawl and emerge from the surrounding dankness in an eerie fashion. You need to actively contend with both threats as you work your way towards the bottom of the mine, occasionally taking to higher ground in order to clear your lungs. Fail to do so in time, and you'll perish. You don't have much choice but to face this danger since you need to flip an array of switches across the mine in order to proceed. It's a hurdle that you've crossed numerous times throughout Revelations 2, but managing your timing and proximity to safety has never been as important as it is here, which makes it more interesting, at least, than other similar switch-based progression puzzles. The stop-and-go nature (looking for an objective, catching your breath, executing an action, and catching your breath) nearly overstays its welcome by the time you move on, but while it lasts, it instills an appropriate mix of suspense and mild confusion as you sprint for safety while attempting to simultaneously keeping track of your goals and surroundings."", ""Beyond the mine lies a surprise, and without saying too much, it's one that will resonate best with Resident Evil fans who've been with the series since the beginning. Unlike most of Revelations 2's locations, this place feels overrun by evil, rather than the product of it. Its claustrophobic architecture and array of creature comforts are equally cozy and haunting, a mix of emotions that has worked well for the series in the past. Unfortunately, this nod to the Resident Evil of old doesn't last long. A key here, some backtracking there, and you're on your way to the final showdown."", ""Revelations 2 hasn't had many boss fights over the course of four episodes, but at least they've been memorable, either for the action therein or the narrative that surrounds them. The final battle falls into both camps as you face your ultimate foe, a slinky boss who runs around on all fours, spouting hate for the person Natalia has become. Get too close to its body and it will strike you, knocking off a significant amount of health, or, wander too close to any of the poison-filled ducts that it's busted open and you may suffocate to death. With a boss that runs away frequently, and plenty of gas obscuring your vision, you have to keep your ears open for its vile speech every time it goes into hiding to guess where it will appear next. It's good that you can survive the fight without having to pray for the right kind of ammunition. Most weapons will do the trick so long as you have a few explosives and your aim is steady enough to hit the boss's weak point with every shot."", ""With the final boss down, there are two potential endings to behold. In one ending, you learn almost nothing new and the credits roll abruptly. It has value, but only in so much as it's a depressing turn of events. The second ending, however, introduces surprises and hope for your troubled crew, in addition to a second half of the boss fight where you get to attack both on foot and from the relative comfort of a moving helicopter."", 'The second ending is definitely the preferred one, but if you don\'t see it the first time through, be prepared to jump back to Episode Three, as it\'s an event there that determines how the ending plays out in Episode Four. Apart from the game telling you that you\'ve earned the ""worst"" possible outcome, you might not realize that there\'s another ending, and frankly, it took crowdsourcing opinions to discover how to go about triggering it. What\'s frustrating is that, in that pivotal moment during Episode Three, you\'re expected to do something that you\'ve been taught a particular character is incapable of doing. If you follow the rules, you\'ll know that you\'re missing out on the real ending when the game tells you, but it would have been so much better if the real ending were the only one.', ""The final episode of Revelations 2 has its problems, especially when it pretends that you can decide Claire and Moira's fate. However, Barry's portion offers just enough excellent gunplay and tense exploration to distract you from that misstep, all before sending you to a great final boss fight, and hopefully the good ending. Revelations 2 doesn't get a pass for obscuring the path to its most satisfying conclusion, but it gets credit for the excitement it ultimately delivers in the true end of this journey and the flicker of the next one creeping in its shadow.""]"Alexa Ray Corriea,16-Mar-15,Tales from the Borderlands: A Telltale Game Series Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tales-from-the-borderlands-episode-two-atlas-mugge/1900-6416067/,8,PC,"['Theres a moment in Tales from the Borderlands second episode, Atlas Mugged, where a ghostly Handsome Jack sticks his arm through Vaughns crotch and then talks to Rhys using his obscene new hand puppet. Its absurd, lewd, and hilarious. This one small moment is the best example of Tales from the Borderlands humor, which seems to bubble up from a never-ending spring of inventive, crass comedy.', 'Episode One, Zer0 Sum, lets you know early on that the Borderlands series flavor of blunt and sometimes childish humor continues to play a central role. Its still going strong in Episode Two, and in fact, may be stronger. The series began on a high point and continues to ride that wave, and although Atlas Mugged has a few lulls to allow for some environmental exploration, its still a blitz from one high-energy scene to another.', 'Rhys and Fiona have an ever-growing list of enemies. Two episodes in, with the keys to a mysterious abandoned Atlas project in hand, they try to outrun assassins, Hyperions murderous boss, and a vengeful ex-boyfriend, all the while looking for a little cash. Hungry for more information on the Vault they discovered in the previous episode, Rhys and Fiona are doubly desperate to stay out of trouble, with very little success.', 'After an entertaining, beautifully choreographed opening sequence--another hallmark of the Borderlands shooter franchise--our four main characters are split up. The separation is not by choice, and most of the episode revolves around the girls and guys trying to find each other. Now that we know more about Rhys, Vaughn, Fiona, and Sasha and the story set up is over, we get more insight into their personalities. Depending on choices you made at the end of Episode One, Fiona, a normally confident con artist, becomes emotional as she and her sister explore their adoptive fathers home. Rhys and Vaughn have a relationship hiccup, after which you can choose whether to keep Vaughn as your best bro or watch him a little more warily. The dialogue among these four and the people they encounter feels almost unscripted, like people who know each other well bantering off the cuff.', ""On the subject of hilarious dialogue, Dameon Clarkes performance as the digital ghost of Handsome Jack is incredible. Its one of the greatest elements of Atlas Mugged. Rhys is the only one who can see and talk to Jack, and watching Rhyss struggle to balance his interactions with Jack and the real world leads, again, to some awkward and gut-busting situations. Jack, one of the most charismatic characters in the Borderlands universe, isn't just a shoehorned-in, a forced entry that brings no weight to the plot. On the contrary, his presence is a major plot point. His role feels organic. Its like Jack was always meant to come back for Tales, and he is the exact same Jack we know and love/fear from the main series."", 'Jack isnt the only canon Borderlands character to appear in Atlas Mugged. The bounty on Fionas head brings one of the series deadliest assassins out to play: Athena. Athena appears briefly, but her starring scene is a high-speed chase through the slums that requires some quick trigger fingers and button presses. Fiona and Sasha end up taking their broken vehicle to Scooters garage. While Scooters scene isnt terribly engaging, its a smart way to connect Tales back to the main Borderlands universe via one of its most mundane and non-fantastical elements, a repair shop.', ""Rhys, Fiona, and their friends, however, still remain the stars. Under the stress of being hunted, they are slowly cracking; they are interesting, well-rounded characters, and following their emotional state is one of the series high points. The supporting cast has also been given more time to shine; the villainous Vasquez is further fleshed out, and August's tenderer side is revealed."", ""Tales from the Borderlands is at its best when its letting you be ordinary, talking among your companions, but it still does a good job of incorporating the series' hallmark shoot-and-loot mechanics, both within the game's tense quick-time sequences, and during missions that require you to steal from your adversaries. You do a lot of that in Episode Two, stealing from safes, conning mechanics into giving you money as well as fixing your car, and shooting dudes in the chest."", 'This episode also frequently uses Rhys Echo Eye, an implant that allows him to scan and hack into anything with a power supply. With a little power-up from Jack, Rhys Echo Eye is now one of the most powerful tools in your arsenal. You still have Fionas tendency to amass large quantities of money, the amount of which will determine just how badass Scooters upgrades to your car will be. Both the money-handling and Echo Eye mechanics are major elements in Episode Two, building on what was briefly introduced in episode one and incorporated well into the evolving plot.', 'Atlas Mugged has the same level of tension that closed out Zer0 Sum. The ending is more than a little nerve-rattling. If youve come to care about this ragtag band of jerks, youll be both satisfied and possibly angry at the final emotional payoff. This is a Telltale Games production after all. It continues to be a crazy ride through a story that successfully employs the most beloved elements of the Borderlands franchise.']"Miguel Concepcion,16-Mar-15,Battlefield Hardline Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/battlefield-hardline-review/1900-6416066/,7,Xbox One,"['The felons and thieves of Battlefield: Hardline are like weak-willed vampires. A quick reveal of a police badge and a yell of ""Freeze!"" is akin to holding up a holy cross in their faces. They surrender despite being armed with semi-automatic rifles, and protected by bulletproof vests. They surrender despite outnumbering you three to one. On the other hand, if you\'re slow on the draw with your badge, these offenders become as lethal as any Battlefield opponent you\'ve previously faced. There\'s no middle ground between their willingness to capitulate and their cold-blooded ruthlessness--and it\'s hilarious. Looking for more consistently challenging opponents? That\'s what Hardline\'s multiplayer is for, with maps and modes that capture Battlefield\'s distinct combined-arms warfare, despite the shift away from traditional combat-ready zones toward civilian locales.', ""The episodic structure of Hardline's campaign is hardly unusual. Chapters are framed with recaps and coming-soon montages, reminiscent of games like Alan Wake and Split/Second, which, incidentally, were released the same day in 2010. To appreciate Hardline's contemporary style, you simply reach the end of any episode, where you're greeted by an image that is apparently inspired by Netflix's streaming service: the next-episode countdown timer. The only feature that's lacking is a 13-episode season; this campaign only has 10, plus a prologue."", 'Hardline\'s story is intended to be appreciated as a TV action drama, though its safe, middle-of-the-road appeal makes it more suited for the USA Network than for Netflix Original Programming. This risk-averse narrative is underscored by its protagonist, Nick Mendoza, your standard issue, incorruptible, straight-and-narrow cop. Just because this medium runs the risk of anti-hero burnout doesn\'t excuse Nick from being ""the boring one"" in an ensemble cast with more interesting characters. In defense of Hardline\'s writers, at least Nick\'s story isn\'t the generic drug supply chain investigation that the initial chapters lead you to believe.', ""It would be a mistake to approach Hardline's campaign in the same way as the straightforward single-player modes of Battlefield 3 and Battlefield 4. Hardline's world is a complicated one, where its dangers and hostility encourage tactful stealth while your all-powerful badge presents tempting opportunities to be more out in the open. Staying hidden means you get to work against some of the most oblivious criminals you'll face in a first-person shooter. For every guard who moves back and forth in a patrol path, you have one who stands in one spot forever, making the latter a laughably easy target. All that you need to survive is a basic level of competence in studying their field-of-vision cones on the minimap."", ""Unless you are a Solid Snake savant, you will be spotted from time to time, and the ensuing shootouts are typical of Battlefield campaigns. Enemies move with enough unpredictability to keep you on your toes, but not so erratically as to frustrate you. More importantly, the levels are wide enough that you're subconsciously encouraged to try different routes should you keep dying in any given section. Enemies react to your last known position, so flanking opportunities abound and the results can be thrilling if you manage to outsmart the AI."", ""Half of the outposts you infiltrate are wired with alarm systems, the kind that call forth reinforcements if you manage to get spotted. If you're not into prolonged shootouts, it's in your best interest to disable these alarms, so not only does Hardline present a dumbed-down version of Metal Gear Solid's radar-based stealth, but it can also be appropriately described as Far Cry 4 with training wheels. It teaches the basics of surveying an area, marking alarm components, and spotting patrolling enemies. Despite the ease, there's an inherent pleasure in clearing an area undetected, just as getting spotted may cause you to kick yourself out of self-imposed frustration."", 'Who needs sneaking when you can sprint toward enemies in broad daylight and yell ""Freeze!"" well before they notice you?', 'Along with the vision cone, a Splinter Cell-inspired detection ring thickens when you remain in a felon\'s field of vision, with the potential of going full alert. This would add palpable tension if not for the fact that these enemies suffer from a combination of poor eyesight and abysmal reactive abilities. Who needs sneaking when you can sprint toward enemies in broad daylight and yell ""Freeze!"" well before they notice you? While it\'s laughably unrealistic, the negative impact isn\'t too distracting, at least not during the initial playthrough. That\'s partly because arrests yield the most points toward the campaign\'s character progression system. Perhaps this reward is a statement by developer Visceral Games that it\'s more worthwhile to arrest someone than it is to kill him, but even so, the steps it takes to cuff someone without being detected aren\'t significantly more challenging than surviving a shootout. The only issue with this points system is that it diminishes the value of replaying the campaign. By arresting roughly two out of every three perps, you can easily reach the level cap of 15 long before the final chapter, thereby removing that particular incentive to play through the story again. Retrieving evidence, on the other hand, has multiplayer repercussions, so you may still wish to make a return trip.', 'For as much as Electronic Arts has flaunted Hardline as ""The Fastest Battlefield Ever,"" the need for speed is not satisfied during the campaign\'s driving sequences. Whether it\'s a daring escape or an equally heated pursuit, these chases are largely forgettable despite the spectacle of ramp jumps and dodging rockets fired from vans. The helicopter takedown during the first driving sequence of Battlefield 4 was more stimulating. Ironically, the only pleasing moments behind the wheel are the few periods when you don\'t have to make a getaway, when the characters in the car are naturally making small talk--trivial but nonetheless engaging chit-chat that you wouldn\'t hear in the dramatic war scenarios of Battlefield 3 or 4.', 'By arresting roughly two out of every three perps, you can easily reach the level cap of 15 long before the final chapter.', ""Speed is instead found in two of Hardline's multiplayer modes, Hotwire and Blood Money. Battlefield vehicles finally get to be more than just death dealers and efficient transports, though Hardline doesn't fully break free from the chains of tradition, including both Conquest and Team Deathmatch in its rotation of modes."", ""In Hotwire, vehicles function as mobile capture points to the players who manage to get behind the wheel. You can't exploit the system by hiding your stolen car in a garage; points are only awarded when you're traveling at speed. This kind of vehicular keep-away is reminiscent of the standout multiplayer events of Driver: San Francisco and Watch Dogs. When you're flooring it, these maps can feel small. Unless you're adept at keeping one eye on the road and another on the minimap, you will inevitably break past the maps' boundaries in the first few rounds, often dying before you have the chance to correct your mistake. Once you're used to a given map's general layout, the conservative approach is to drive laps around the map's outer lanes. While this might keep your top speed high, it can make you a predictable target, especially against a rocket-propelled grenade."", 'Blood Money effectively captures the time urgency depicted in countless robbery films.', ""Vehicles have been synonymous with Battlefield since its inception, so placing the series in the context of the modern-day heist makes a lot of sense, especially given the ubiquity of getaway vans. An escape vehicle is essential in Blood Money, a mode in which both the cops and robbers are looting an evidence vault of cash at the center of the map. The importance of a getaway vehicle near the vault can't be understated, since a packed van of proper villains with bags of loot can turn the tide in the brief time span of a single cash delivery. It effectively captures the time urgency depicted in countless robbery films. Team members can be meaningful contributors by ignoring the cash and instead focusing on being efficient wheelmen (though anyone with money can also drive the van). If you find yourself yelling, Get in the van! We gotta go!, simply embrace the fact that you've become a crime movie cliche. Stakes are higher particularly in maps with helicopters, where deliveries are even quicker provided the competition doesn't have a rocket with your name on it."", ""This emphasis on teamwork highlights one of the core values of Battlefield, a series that popularized rewarding players for contributions beyond mere kill counts and other individual achievements. Wheelmen who stay close to players making cash deposits are awarded proximity bonuses. It's rare to get this much gratification from being a mere shuttle driver going back and forth between two points. In Hotwire, a packed van can last a long time if you have enough teammates firing back at pursuers and at least one buddy constantly repairing the van while inside of it."", ""What makes Blood Money more than just a race to collect the most money from a neutral vault is the option to raid the opposition's vault as well. This can be a headache for teams that don't know how to multitask and divvy up responsibilities. Imagine hauling a big score to your home base only find yourself at the receiving end of a shotgun blast. As your new sworn enemy collects the cash from your vault (and your corpse) and heads for the getaway van, you're anxiously counting the seconds before respawning. Any reasonable thief wouldn't blame you for taking this personally. A thirst for vengeance plus a set of wheels equals a beeline to the opponent's base for the opportunity of justified retribution."", ""The influence of e-sports is felt in Hardline's two five-versus-five modes, Crosshair and Rescue. Both offer multiple conditions for victory, which leads to multiple team-driven strategies. You cannot respawn in these two modes, so eliminating the entire team in order to win is certainly an option. Rescue is a well-designed retrieval mode in which the law enforcement side has to save one hostage at the other end of the map. Visceral Games wisely provided two hostages to choose from per round, a design choice that helps spread out the hostage takers, thereby balancing sides in an otherwise lopsided mode. Equally unpredictable is Crosshair, in which the police are tasked with escorting an informant to a rendezvous point. Given that the cops do not have to stick together and the VIP is well armed (with a potent golden gun, no less), Crosshair often turns into an engaging guessing game for those hunting the snitch."", 'For every guard who moves back and forth in a patrol path, you have one who stands in one spot forever.', ""These opportunities to outthink enemies strike at the core of these Battlefield modes unique to Hardline and go hand-in-hand with countless opportunities for risk assessment. Camping at the VIP's escape point might be a sneaky tactic in Crosshair, but how does that help when your team in the field is now one man short and respawns aren't allowed? One of the smartest things you can do in Blood Money is driving a mobile spawn point to an inconspicuous spot close to the vault. Novice teams will wonder why your side manages to dominate the match despite the kills piling up equally on both sides. Furthermore, the more teammates you have collecting cash evidence, the faster you're able to amass Benjamins individually. Greed sets in, and you wonder if you can stick around and grab one more handful before stiff opposition arrives to kill you all. Do you have a personal cut-off of five handfuls, or do you max out at ten? Temptation weighs heavily on you in Blood Money."", 'The simplicity of the campaign\'s stealth gameplay and the enemies\' readiness to submit at the sound of ""Freeze!"" is comical, though the silliness was not likely Visceral\'s intention. Even in Battlefield: Hardline, multiplayer competition remains the series\' heart and soul. It wasn\'t that long ago that the ability to eject from a fighter plane and seamlessly continue the battle on foot was one of the most awe-inspiring things you can do in an online shooter. That\'s why many gravitated to the Battlefield series in the first place, and Hardline isn\'t short of similar transitional vehicular moments. You can spawn in a chopper, do your part as a gunner to take out valued targets on that ground, and then jump out with a parachute so you can capture a marked car. This isn\'t Iwo Jima or an Arabian oil field--but it\'s still pure Battlefield.']"Alexa Ray Corriea,16-Mar-15,Final Fantasy Type-0 Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-type-0-hd-review/1900-6416065/,8,PS4,"['It is fitting that a game about war--its passionate triumphs, its bloody defeats, its tragic consequences--would focus so heavily on combat. In Final Fantasy Type-0, you guide a group of gifted teenagers through numerous campaigns to capture opposing cities and kill the powerful beings aiding enemy nations. This group, Class Zero, is made up of 14 characters enhanced with magical and physical abilities, making them living machines of war. Japanese PSP owners have waged that war since 2011, but this high-definition rendition is the first time the battles have spilled into the West. And what a fortuitous arrival Final Fantasy Type-0 is, expressing the travails of war through breakneck battles and demanding boss encounters that test your will.', 'All of Class Zeros members interact in enjoyable ways, but most of their stories are overshadowed by the torrid romance budding between classmates Rem and Machina, and their struggle to fight their own demons as well as the war. Their tale is more heartfelt and more engaging than Class Zeros squabbling, which often relates to the war raging across the world of Orience. The narrative throws in too many names and locations with little explanation, leaning heavily on terms like ""l\'Cie"" and ""Phantoma,"" which are briefly discussed but never fully fleshed out, although you frequently encounter the entities these terms refer to as the story progresses. You\'re introduced to a dozen characters, only to see them once or twice before they wind up being killed suddenly or dropped from the plot altogether. Outside of Class Zero, the supporting cast falls short and makes for some confusing moments when the narrative depends on you to remember faces youve only briefly glimpsed. However, the love story between Class Zero\'s two ordinary members, and the strong reactions non-playable characters have towards Class Zero\'s accomplishments, gives the war narrative palpable weight.', ""The military plot gets complicated quickly, but events within Class Zero are fairly easy to follow until the game hits its first dramatic climax halfway through. It's here that too many major story points are introduced quickly, and all at once. The members of Class Zero are the children of a mad sorceress-doctor who is, as you can guess, not all that she seems. The kids get along decently with one another, but not at all with outsiders; Class Zeros members were accepted to the academy without entrance exams at the insistence of their mother, so talking with NPCs as any member of Class Zero often yields deriding comments and snark about how the children dont fit in with the rest of Akademia, a university breeding children for war."", 'At any time while wandering the world, you control one member of Class Zero as he or she talks to NPCs, either to receive a fetch quest, or simply to chat. Conversations may have different outcomes depending on which character you are currently controlling. For example, if you talk to Dr. Arecia Al-Rashia as Rem or Machina--the two new members of Class Zero who dont fall under her affection--she greets you with disdain. Approach her as Ace or Cater, however, and she warmly engages with you. Elsewhere, some side quests require that you talk to certain people or complete tasks as Rem, who is a favorite among her peers. These subtle nuances make all 14 characters matter. Each has his or her own distinct personality, and while some Class Zero members are less bearable than others, they have great conversations when interacting as a group. Watching the airheaded Cinque try and reason with the know-it-all Trey, all while snarky Sice tells them both to shut up, is always entertaining, as is seeing opposing personalities like Cater and Queen--one sassy, and one cold and rational--pair up to solve problems.', ""Type-0s combat is marvelous. Your 14 playable characters have four moves each available to them: a powerful physical attack, a defensive spell like Cure or Protect, and two abilities that can be customized with magic spells and attacks unique to that character. At any given time, three party members take to the battlefield, but you only directly control one at a time. You can, however, switch between them on the fly. Classmates and their enemies attack rapidly in real time, leaving little room to breathe, and forcing you to constantly swing the camera around to keep your enemies in sight, which can be a bit of a headache, but ensures you don't spend too much time hammering on one individual combatant. Battles are electric, filling the screen with light and color, and keeping you on your toes as you glance around the arena and speed towards the enemies in most need of extermination."", ""The ability to swap between characters on a moment's notice is a powerful one. One moment, you fling around Sices scythe, and the next, you instantly swap in Trey to shoot down flying enemies with his bow and arrows. Battles give rise to an elegant and satisfying rhythm as you switch between ranged and melee characters as needed. You may only control one character at a time, but the AI that commands the other two party members is always on point. You never feel like youre taking down opponents on your own, and if you do a good job of leveling up each Class Zero member, then you take well-trained combatants into the field with you. I got into the habit of taking my two lowest-level characters into new missions, along with one of my higher-level ones, and I was delighted to find my higher-level fighter actively pursuing enemies and dealing the same amount of damage he would if I were controlling him. The AI doesn't slow down or deal lighter hits, so you aren't doing the heavy lifting all on your own."", 'The result of the cunning AI? Your skirmishers feel like a cohesive team, rather than a single hero accompanied by unnecessary deadweight. Thats even the case when you put the games support personnel (SP) system to the test, which sends random NPCs into battle to support you, instead of other Class Zero members. SP characters are smart, and typically come in at a level that matches, or is higher than, the character you are controlling. If support characters die in battle, you cant revive them, but you can call in reserve members of Class Zero to take their places.', ""Typically, you take on dozens of giant mechs and angry soldiers in story missions, but when crossing the overworld--the giant map on which you walk over Orience--random encounters crop up. These usually entail quickly mowing down a group of enemies for experience points. If there are other enemies nearby, they detect your presence, and the game gives you the option to immediately fight them or retreat. If you accept the fight, you could feasibly clash with four or five groups of similar enemy types in a row without having to run around the map. This is an excellent way to amass quick experience points and materials, as Type-0s main missions become significantly difficult with each passing success, so you need to do some grinding. The repetition is rarely tedious, however: Small but fundamental touches like the combats whirlwind speed, and the option to repeatedly fight the same random counter several times without traveling, mean you don't have to run in circles, wasting time hoping for more foes to appear."", 'Story missions in Type-0 are straightforward, but not without their rewards. You usually run through a maze of connecting rooms, destroying the opposing soldiers as well as the beasts that serve them. Mercifully, Type-0 adds a handful of checkpoints to each level, allowing you to save frequently, and never did the game fail to offer me a checkpoint right before a major battle or complicated mission. Some battles require you to think tactically, throwing in air strike support, and forcing you to carefully find cover while you summon and position bombs from above. Others feature bosses with a half-dozen health bars that only take damage from well-timed critical hits. In these instances, you must act strategically, waiting out enemy attacks while getting as close as you can to strike. Missions constantly change up their layout and goals, giving rise to a vast number of combat situations and strategies.', ""The mission variety is beautifully complemented by the diversity of combat techniques at your disposal. Right off the bat, Type-0 asks that you level up each class member as evenly as possible, as each uses unique weaponry: swords, guns, a sword-whip, a deck of cards, or even a magic flute. Certain enemies are most susceptible to certain kinds of magic, while others go down only when you unleash brutal melee attacks. Others still fly around and can only be reached by ranged weapons like guns, or Ace's cards. Having so many possibilities lurking underneath your fingertips makes it enjoyable to spend equal amounts of time with each Class Zero member."", 'Characters earn ability points as they level up, and you use them to unlock more powerful abilities. Those two ability slots can be any combination of physical and magic attacks, though its best to stick at least one magic attack in there if the character doesnt use ranged weapons. In this same way, you customize the abilities of your summons: powerful beings like Shiva and Ifrit that are called to the battlefield by sacrificing a team member for the remainder of battle. These summons deal significant damage, making them ideal for boss battles, and the more frequently you use them, the more powerful they get.', ""Magic spells can also be customized with Phantoma, a mysterious resource you collect from slain enemies. Different colors of Phantoma ascribe different properties to spells, and can be used to lower the spells cost or casting time, or to ramp up its power. Exceedingly powerful weapons eventually become available, although they cannot be customized. But between curating each member of Class Zeros individual attack lineup and the potency of their spells, you take ownership of your characters' progression--and as you internalize how powerful Class Zero is becoming, the story in turn gives context to their growth. Type-0 gives you fine control of every party members advancement, and in doing so, encourages you to tackle bigger challenges so that you may continue to guide them upwards and onwards."", 'All told, Type-0 does combat and customization better than many of its fellow RPGs. Its immensely satisfying to land hits in rapid succession, and then to instantly switch to another character, whaling on an enemy to cinch a five-second victory. This one-two punch of role-playing richness gives rise to a just one more battle mentality, though you should note that not every encounter is a seconds-long fireworks display. The HD version of Type-0 includes an Easy mode in which battle is more manageable, but Normal mode is wildly difficult and requires a modicum of grinding to bring yourself up to speed. Mercifully, the game lets you change the difficulty at any checkpoint, so if a certain boss is giving you grief, you can adjust the difficulty level to make it through. This is a nice touch if you come to Type-0 for Final Fantasys familiar brand of storytelling, and not so much for its nail-biting enemy encounters, though its worth mentioning again that combat is the games primary draw.', 'There are a bunch of optional missions in addition to main storyline tasks, but you can safely get through Type-0 without completing any of them, should you wish. These include skirmish missions, in which you run across the map supporting troops as they invade enemy cities, and side quests that require you to fetch specific items for NPCs. The former reward you with experience points and extra checkpoints across the map, while the latter give you much-needed support items like Mega-Ethers and Elixirs. These tasks are simple, so you can accomplish a few of them before heading into storyline missions without breaking into a sweat. My primary gripe with Type-0s campaign structure lies with its boss battles, which rely all too heavily on the Hopeless Boss Fight cliche, ushering you into scripted encounters you arent meant to win. The final boss sequence is the greater disappointment, however. Final Fantasy games are known for the grand battles that cap their stories, but the wan final fight subverts tradition in a particularly unsatisfying manner.', ""Type-0 looks good, but it's an uneven visual experience due to the inconsistency of its high-definition paint job. Backgrounds are gorgeously detailed, and each area is stuffed with NPCs that invite you into conversation, making Orience come alive with personality. The main characters move beautifully, and their expressive faces convey a wide range of emotions. However, characters who are not part of Class Zero, or are not important to its members, dont benefit from the same care and attention. Many of them look much as they did on PSP--just a little smoother. Its awkward to see conversations between Machina and Cadetmaster, as one character looks great and the other hasnt been touched up to match."", ""Final Fantasy Type-0 HD is about the fluid and frantic action, which propels you towards the next battle, and then the next, and then the next. The overarching story is tough to chew on, but the heartfelt personal stories vividly address the ugly side of war--the blood, the gore, and the sadness that lingers even when the memories of why you were fighting fade away. Yet its the battles themselves that make the most forcible argument for spending 25-plus hours with Final Fantasy Type-0, for it's in the combat arenas that Orience truly comes to life."", ' ', ' ']"Mark Walton,16-Mar-15,Mario Party 10 Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mario-party-10-review/1900-6416064/,6,Wii U,"['Ah, Mario Party, the game that, on paper at least, should be a rollicking good time filled with joyful minigames and all your favourite Nintendo characters. It\'s hard not be suckered in by that classic Nintendo charm, the bright colours, the jangly music, Mario yelling ""it\'s-a-me!"" If games were fun based on nostalgia value alone, then Mario Party 10 would be a wonderful creation. But they\'re not, and once you\'re over the sight of Mario and friends riding along in a Boo-inspired ghost train, the game\'s mildly amusing take on a family board game wears thin.', ""That's not to say there isn't some fun to be had, particularly if you've got some good friends to play with--it's just that Mario Party 10 isn't the kind of game you'll want to dig out more than a couple of times a year. Part of the problem is that, like Mario Party 9, Mario Party 10 is essentially the same board game-inspired experience as it's always been. Granted, the move to the Wii U has opened up a few new ways to play via the wonder of the gamepad or a selected group of Amiibo, but these things are mere window dressing over Mario Party's otherwise unchanged core."", ""Let's start with the biggest change: the Amiibo integration. On the surface, getting some use out of Nintendo's cute plastic figures of joy is no bad thing, particularly as, up to this point, they've played a largely passive role in the games they've been compatible with. They play a much bigger role in Mario Party 10, but there are some limitations. For starters, only a very specific set of Amiibo do anything significant, with the rest relegated to a read-only capacity to earn Mario Party points that can be spent on items in the game."", 'Those Amiibo with full functionality can only be used in the specific Amiibo mode, which harks back to Mario Party games of old. Instead of a large board where all four players travel around in a vehicle together like in Mario Marty 9, the Amiibo mode makes use of a much smaller circular board, with each player fighting it out to collect the most stars across 10 rounds. Virtual dice rolls dictate how far you move around the board, while the squares that you land on dish out coins, bonuses, and minigames, or take away coins and set you back a few places. Depending on what Amiibo you use, the board takes on a different theme. Scan in Mario, and you get a board full of goombas and Mushroom powerups; scan in Donkey Kong, and the game brings up various jungle-based fripperies.', 'Each board has its own different ways of distributing powerups like slow dice and 4-5-6 dice to players. I particularly like the Mario board, which featured a set of ?-boxes, where finding the mushroom would grow your character and have it storm around the board stealing coins from other players. Amiibos are also able to carry around a special token with them that you find during your travels around the board. These do things like add more stars to the board, randomly dole out coins, or switch a section of the board out for another themed version from the likes of Peach and Yoshi.', ""This looks pretty neat, particularly if you manage to deck out each quarter of the board in a different theme. But it is mostly just looks. There's little strategic value to swapping out the boards, each merely serving as a slightly different way to dish out the same set of powerups. What does change things up is how you collect stars. Instead of being given stars as you work your way around the board, you have to collect coins by landing on certain squares. 20 coins net you one star, but you can only trade those coins in when you find a square on the board with a star floating above it. If you land on the square and you don't have 20 coins, you're out of luck."", ""With the stars moving randomly around the board after each round, items like warp pipes or special dice that can move you backwards become incredibly valuable. Indeed, this system is one of the few things in Mario Party that gives you some sort of strategic option to best the opposition, rather than simply relying on a roll of the dice. Amiibo mode is fun, and the quicker rounds make it a good option for those who'd rather not go through a full half-hour game. Still, it's hard to ignore that the Amiibo mode is essentially just a smaller version of a full-blown Mario Party. You might be travelling on your lonesome rather than together in a vehicle, but the end result is the same: roll the dice, move around the board, and collect as many stars as possible."", ""Naturally, there are some fun minigames to break up the action. They're played after each round in Amiibo mode, or when you land on a certain square Mario Party mode, which brings back the group vehicle travelling of Mario Party 9. For the most part, these games are easy to pick up, and instil the sort of aggressive, expletive-filled competition that one might not expect from such a family orientated game. Most of the minigames are a free-for-all (where every player competes against each other), and consist of a mixture of action-based platforming challenges and frantic motion-controlled games, and slower-paced memory games and pattern-recognition tests."", 'These include climbing up ladders and bouncing off the head of a giant goomba to score points, smashing as many leaping fish out of the air as possible, and (my personal favourite), having to pose in front of the camera while also slapping the other players out of the shot. There are some neat 2v2 challenges to play through too, including a Monkeyball-like soccer game played by tilting the Wii Remote. Ah, but ""what about the Gamepad"" I hear you cry! Yes, the gamepad plays a starring role in the new Bowser Party mode, or in Amiibo mode if you have a Bowser Amiibo to use.', ""Either way, one player takes on the role of Bowser, using the gamepad to play minigames against the other four players. While these minigames don't exactly make the game-changer Nintendo might have hoped for, they're actually pretty fun. Some of my favourites included a game where you tilt the gamepad to move fiery bars around while the other players have to jump around and avoid them, another that has you chasing players up a wall while they madly smash buttons Track and Field-style to escape, and another that's an evil version of roulette played with bombs and traps."", ""In Bowser Party, there are also sections where Bowser can attempt to deceive the other players by drawing doodles or placing stamps over different paths on the map or on mystery crates that may contain prizes or dangers. Weirdly, during these moments the game tells you to trick the other players via the main screen, which sort of defeats the object of the whole thing. But I suppose this way you're left questioning whether those doodles are a double bluff, or even a triple bluff. Despite all these additions, though, playing as Bowser is much less entertaining than playing at the other characters, mostly because there's far more waiting around, trying to catch up with the other players who get a head start."", ""It's only when you catch up with them that the minigames kick into action, and it's those that make up the bulk of Mario Party 10's entertainment value. There are at least quite a few of them on offer, and it's rare to see the same two minigames during a single round. However, like previous games in the series, Mario Party 10 is often more about luck than any skill you might have shown along the way. The game has an annoying habit of stealing stars away from whoever is in the lead, making any effort you've put into the minigames largely a moot point. Playing against friends is one thing, because you'll at least have someone to vent at, but against the AI, the game becomes very frustrating."", ""Despite the Amiibo additions and gamepad Bowser games, as well as a delightfully bright and colourful aesthetic, it's hard to ignore just how similar this game is to its predecessors. But even if you could overlook it, the fact remains that even with some fun minigames in tow and a good group of friends to enjoy it with, Mario Party 10 just doesn't have the depth or the challenge to hold your attention for long."", ' ']"Britton Peele,13-Mar-15,White Night Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/white-night-review/1900-6416063/,6,Xbox One,"[""A striking aesthetic can grab your attention, but a game needs more than looks if it's going to keep it. The noir-inspired White Night gets caught in a loop of offering more before taking it away, making for a horror experience that is sometimes wonderful, often lackluster, and frequently frustrating."", ""White Night is a horror story told in black and white. Set in the 1930s during the Great Depression, it's a noir tale that's part serial killer mystery, part supernatural ghost story. You break into a nearby house to look for help after being hobbled in a car crash. The game could be compared to Resident Evil largely due to its fixed camera angles, but you won't be shooting any monsters. Instead, you spend the majority of your time exploring the house and the mysteries it holds, all while intoning your thoughts in typically stilted and melodramatic noir fashion."", ""It is more adventure game than survival horror, though one element of White Night that stays true to the survival horror genre is item management; specifically, you collect matchsticks, which are your only source of light for most of the game. Matchbooks can be found littered liberally throughout the house, but you can only hold a handful of them at a time. They burn out quickly, making your stock of them something you always want to keep an eye on. If you're caught in the dark for too long, you're dead."", ""Matchstick management is one of several examples of good ideas in White Night that often go wrong. Matchsticks are perfect for mood lighting, and using your supply provides good tension, but their implementation can be frustrating. For one thing, many actions in the game (including saving, which is done manually by sitting in a well-lit armchair) require you to put your match out. Just lit your next-to-last match? Sorry: you've got to extinguish it if you want to open a chest to get the items inside."", ""On random occasions, your matches also fail when you try to light them. Sure, there's some realism to this, and there's something horror movie-esque about desperately trying to strike a match that won't light, but when you're forced to replay sections of the game because two of your four remaining matches ran out and you got stuck in a dark room, this isnt moody--its annoying."", ""White Night's fixed camera angles are similarly hit-and-miss. While they provide a more cinematic look, they don't play well with the two-tone look of the game. There isn't much detail to the game's black and white environments--your character notices a statues hand protruding from the ground, but you could never yourself tell based on the smudge of black and white that depicts it--and thus, it can sometimes be hard to get a great sense of your surroundings when the camera switches from one angle to another. What begins as a striking look becomes a tedious visual obstacle."", ""This is most evident--and most upsetting--when you're running away from danger. There's no combat in White Night, but there is an antagonist: a woman who manifests herself as several ghosts that can kill you if you touch them. A ghost can only be harmed by electric light (which is why they break the house's lights at every opportunity), so you spend most of your time trying to avoid them. At times, this system functions well enough. Other times, it's frustrating. You often have to weave your way through several ghosts to reach your destination, and you may find yourself running the wrong way after the camera changes on you--that is, if you're not already caught in the geometry of the environment."", ""Your ability to save only in select corners of select rooms (with a few, story-determined exceptions) leads to tedious scenarios in which you know exactly where you need to go and what you need to do, but you have to retry the same sections over and over again because you keep getting caught heading from one save point to another. On the upside, the ghosts are appropriately creepy--they are unsettling images that dont rely on cheap tricks, like loud noises, to induce jump scares. But your fear of the ghosts evaporates the more times they catch you, because the death sequence isn't horrifying; it's just a path to your most recent save."", ""Despite its faults, the methodical exploration of the house is typically satisfying. When you're given room to breathe and you can simply poke around, White Night is an intriguing adventure game. Most of the puzzles are simple to solve and arent annoyingly convoluted. When you do find yourself stuck, useful hints can be found in the in-game newspaper (which is really more of a journal), and the main character himself will ponder possible solutions if you wander aimlessly for too long. The game's story is something of a saving grace, most of the time. Told mostly through collectible diaries, letters, and newspaper articles scattered throughout the house, the tale of White Night's main characters comes together well. Unfortunately, the game comes to a predictable conclusion, and the dialogue occasionally drifts into tangents that try to convey a deeper meaning than they can actually accomplish."", 'White Night has other minor issues, such as its lack of a useful map, but these flaws stand out primarily because of the possibilities the game never realizes. But there are frightful joys to uncover, nonetheless. There were numerous moments when I was exploring the environment, reading the back story, and solving the puzzles, that I enjoyed myself. I wanted to find the next journal entry and see how the story ended, and at times (particularly early on), I was genuinely creeped out by the atmosphere. The pieces that make up White Night could have added up to a great interactive horror story. Sadly, the good game you can imagine is stuck lurking in the shadows of the game it became.']"Brett Todd,12-Mar-15,Cities: Skylines Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/cities-skylines-review/1900-6416062/,8,PC,"[""Now this is more like it. Even though my real-world occupation as the mayor of a Canadian town means that I try to escape such things as budget meetings and zoning hearings when I play games, Cities: Skylines still managed to hook me due to its authenticity. Unlike the latest SimCity, which was far too fantastical to let me build cities that resembled those in the real world (size limitations and not being able to establish proper zoning districts drove me crazy), this Colossal Order production nails just enough of what is fun about running a municipality in the real world. Proper zoning, room to grow, and the addition of policies and districts that let you plan out sensible city development make for a (mostly) bona fide experience in the virtual mayor's chair."", ""Making comparisons between games is not always helpful, but in this case, it's difficult to ignore the tight relationship between Cities: Skylines and its SimCity inspiration. Colossal Order delves deep into what Maxis and EA once made so popular with a traditional city-building approach. Few surprises or even significant innovations can be found here: There is just a standard single-player mode of play in which you choose from a handful of maps representing territory types ranging from flat plains to tropical beaches. You may also play the game with standard conditions, dial up the difficulty, and/or turn on sandbox and unlimited-money mods. No tutorial is included, either, which makes for a learning curve at the beginning. At least tips are provided on a continual basis during regular play."", 'Multiplayer is totally absent, as are frilly options like disasters and giant monster attacks. There are no multiple-city games, either. You have one city to deal with, along with a mostly invisible outside world that allows you to buy and sell goods on a common market. The game has been developed with modding in mind, however, and it ships with a full editor. Therefore, you can expect a lot of user-made add-ons to hit the net shortly. Nonetheless, at the present time, this ""just the facts"" focus makes for an initially bland experience. The plainness is exacerbated by stark menu screens and dated visuals that are attractive enough to get by, while at the same time cutting corners by cloning buildings and signs, as well as lacking amenities like a day-night cycle and weather patterns.', ""If you have been jonesing to be a virtual mayor, though, Cities: Skylines gets nearly everything else just right. First off is zoning. You have full control over zoning neighborhoods as low or high (medium is absent, although I didn't miss it) residential, commercial, and industrial. These basic mechanics provide thorough control over laying out cities, which gives you a real sense of being in charge. Second up is map size, which allows for a lot of stretching out. The initial size is restrictive at 2km by 2km, but you can access more plots of land to eventually expand to a metropolis spanning a whopping 36 square km. That allows for expansive burgs, and an incredible sense of freedom. You always have room to correct mistakes and grow out of early problems, making you feel more like the super-mayor that you should feel like, and not the goofball constantly demolishing whole neighborhoods to fix problems you couldn't have foreseen three hours ago."", 'Two other great features involve establishing districts and policies. This allows for the creation of boroughs with separate identities (policies can be set to take in entire cities, as well) by drawing them out with the Paint District tool. If you want your very own Brooklyn hipsters or a hardhat neighborhood for factory Joes, you can paint out city blocks and then tweak localized settings. This allows you to offer free public transit, boost education, give away smoke detectors, get into high-tech homes, ban high rises, and even alter tax rates for different zones. You can also set up specific industrial areas to focus efforts there. So if you want a green city, allow only farming use in industrial zones. If you want to go in the other direction with the sort of hardcore factories that killed grandpa, you can set up oil or ore districts and watch the smokestacks pump out poison.', 'Policies are on the fanciful side, and establishing wildly different rules on social activities and even tax rates between neighborhoods in the same city will not go over well on election day. But I still love the ability to fine-tune cities without delving too deeply into micromanagement. The district and policy features combine to let me sketch out what I want in each part of my city--yes, this will be my gentrified borough for snotty white-collar professionals, complete with a smoking ban, no pets, no high rises, recycling, allowance for the use of certain controlled recreational substances, high-tech homes, and, of course, stupid high taxes--and then sit back and watch neighborhoods evolve.', 'Basic mechanics provide thorough control over laying out cities.', ""The challenge is not pronounced, especially if you have city-building experience. You needn't worry about random sparks somehow taking down whole blocks, or other acts of God obliterating all of your hard work. This gives Cities: Skylines a relaxed character, instead of coming across like a rigorous game loaded with set objectives and problems to be solved. It's an old approach, but a great one, as it allows you to concentrate on the abstractions of building, instead of mindlessly racing around meeting random goals related to citizen happiness or residency numbers."", ""The only aspect of the game that becomes annoying to handle is transit. Given the same developer's Cities in Motion series, you might expect roads, buses, and the like to take on a vital role. Ultimately, however, transportation systems are overly Byzantine and convoluted, particularly when it comes to bus routes. It's difficult to tell if transportation woes are your own wrongdoing, or if there are problems with vehicle pathfinding in the game itself. You can muddle through, although you never exert the same level of control with transit as with everything else."", ""Nevertheless, Cities: Skylines is the best city-builder on the market right now. The game's presentation is stodgy, but it is all but guaranteed to provide you many hours of carefully crafting cities, laying out zoning, and establishing districts for specifics residential and industrial uses...all free from real-world mayoral headaches like 6 a.m. phone calls griping about snowplowing. Right now, there is no better way to take a peek at life as a mayor without filing your papers to run for office in the real world.""]"Leif Johnson,12-Mar-15,Trash TV Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/trash-tv-review/1900-6416059/,6,PC,"[""Trash TV? When you first hear the title, you might expect a game that sends you off to battle the forces of network evil with the likes of Snooki and Kim Kardashian, but this 2D sidescroller and puzzler takes its title far more literally than that. You are, after all, a TV, and you're in the trash. You follow the tubular guy as he bounds from platform to platform in a grim recycling plant in search of his remote, all while using everything from uzis to shotguns to battle his way to destiny. Like so much trashy TV, the game is not particularly memorable, but neither is it entirely without appeal."", 'Its heart is certainly in the right place. The artistry that characterizes games from the current 2D revival shows up in the very first seconds, as you guide a single pixel to merge with others in order to bring life to the dead box. Personality oozes from the presentation, particularly in the way that the display defaults to a curved 4:3 aspect ratio that recalls old Magnavoxes and Zeniths, or in the way the IBA-style cue dots march across the upper right of the screen as you near the end of a level. At some points, the screen crackles and fuzzes up and vaguely Pip-Boy-esque cartoons pop up to display hints. When you die, it cuts to the colored rectangular bars familiar from the days when networks actually went offline.', ""The 2D, slightly pixelated style perfectly fits the subject matter. It's a style that belongs to the era of its antenna-capped protagonist, and not so much to today's world of curved Samsungs and 4K resolutions. It's a style that promises the magic some of us experienced on the NES on similar screens in the 1980s, and the general fluidity of the controls as the TV flits across molten steel and lasers suggests that developer Lawrence Russell has the chops to pull it off. I found it especially fun with an Xbox 360 controller."", ""Too bad the end experience comes off as merely passable. Part of the reason why Trash TV shares the same running time as late-night network movies is that it rarely presents a challenge, so thoroughly does it cling to the most basic conventions of the current crop of platforms. Our TV bounds from platform to platform, sometimes while lava fills gaps behind him or massive platforms threaten to crush him, but Trash TV never achieves a tenth of the tension of games like Super Meat Boy. Even death is forgivable, essentially resulting in a quick respawn to the point at which you fouled up. Much of the progression centers on placing crates on the right buttons at the right time (and, pleasingly, some of the crates affectionately recall Portal's Companion Cube), but never once did I find myself stumped for more than ten seconds. Get into the rhythm, and the whole thing flies by in a blur, which eventually caused me to slip into same type of slack-jawed hypnotism I might experience while watching My Strange Addiction or Buckwild."", ""That's not to say that I didn't enjoy my time with Trash TV; far from it. It's just that, as with so much trashy TV, getting the most out of it usually involves forgetting that I could be doing something better. And to its credit, Trash TV does a good job of keeping the experience from slipping into a repetitive slog. Indeed, my chief enjoyment from the game sprang not from the actual platforming but rather from each weapon that TV Guy finds inexplicably strewn around the facility, whether it's a simple handgun or shotgun or, later, twin uzis and C4 explosives that he uses to blast crates and vindictive vending machines. The timing is great--new weapons usually appear just as the previous one is wearing out its welcome. (Alas, that's also a problem, as it's almost never necessary to use a particular weapon again once you've moved past its specialized zone.)"", 'And so it goes for two hours, to the tune of a catchy but similarly passable soundtrack. The entire experience would have been better if Russell had managed to work some boss battles into the mix, but all that usually heralds the end of the stage are the cue dots mentioned above. On at least one occasion, I failed to even notice I\'d completed a level. At times, the hint of something better presents itself, such as when you have to to fend off a swarm of other appliances while you wait for an elevator to descend, but then the end comes (along with the promise of a new ""season"") and you realize that was as good as it gets.', 'It shouldn\'t have been. The potential for greatness broadcasts from every corner of Trash TV, but it comes off as guilty-pleasure television programming that was rushed out by studio executives intent on meeting a deadline. And perhaps there\'s some truth to that. Trash TV seems to have started life as a co-op game, and even now, that legacy shows up in the hand-drawn artwork that\'s used to promote the game, in which two CRT television sets face off against a clothes dryer and a slot machine atop a garbage heap. Russell\'s blog claims it could still make an appearance as a ""post-launch free update,"" but that was almost a year ago.', ""Even so, I had fun. Trash TV's puzzles and platforming might bear the heavy stamp of other games that came before it, but its endearing use of the conventions of CRT television paired with weapon-toting boob tubes does much to make up for such misgivings. As with a decent trashy TV show, I probably won't experience it again, but I can't say I didn't enjoy my brief time with it.""]"Justin Clark,12-Mar-15,Deathtrap Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/deathtrap-review/1900-6416022/,7,PC,"[""Deathtrap is one of those genre mash-ups that make you wonder why we haven't seen more of them in recent years, and it's almost a foregone conclusion that we're going to see a lot more of them, and soon. It's an absorbing tower defense game mashed up with a dark, gothic, top-down action role-playing game, and it's just as fun as both."", ""The setup is simple. You play as a magic-spamming sorceress, a melee-fighting warrior, or a stealthy gunslinger who must stop waves of snarling demons from reaching a portal on your side of the isometric-perspective stage and thus getting out of their realm and into ours. You do have plain-Jane Diablo-style attacks and a few area-clearing special attacks later on, but they can only do so much damage before the enemies run past you. Your one ace in the hole against the never-ending horde is the ability to activate long-dormant magical traps in the environment along the demons' pre-set route, which can be anything from simple gun turrets and floor spikes to towers that shoot lightning at random intervals, acid pools, and portals that generate little snarling beasts of your own that turn into little snarling suicide bombers that explode when they reach the nearest enemy. Victory means putting together a sadistic Rube Goldberg conveyor belt of doom through which no demon can pass and, if they do, walking in yourself to try to finish the job."", ' ', ""Deathtrap is, technically, a spin-off of developer Neocore Games's Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing games, liberally retooling the tower defense mode from the first game in the series. The story does link up, but despite some snippets of backstory thrust upon the player when selecting a stage, it's not necessary to jump right into the fray. What you do end up needing is some instructions, and while the tutorial pop-ups will give you a 10-cent tour of the interface, figuring out the game's flow requires plenty of trial and error. It's not necessarily a bad thing. Most of the game is easy enough to figure out for anyone who's played a game in either genre, with one button for regular attacks, one for a powerful magic attack, and traps costing Essence, and special points that regenerate after each wave and any time you kill an enemy. There's a tiny frustration where, often, your best vantage point is a few feet away from the action, and clicking the left mouse at the wrong place and the wrong time will send your character into a 30-monster murder pit from which there's no escape. Nevertheless, you do learn to compensate, and there are RPGs with far worse navigation problems than an overly sensitive playing field. It's still the best of both of its worlds. This structure fixes the tower defense problem of having to wait around for your enemies to come to you before the action begins by letting you get yourself right into the thick of it, and any moment of overwhelming odds can be fixed by letting your death machines do the dirty work."", ""The first few stages do go pretty easy on you until you get your first new traps, and the steady escalation of difficulty is good. Much of the leveling-up and character advancement is contingent on what feels comfortable for the player. How you end up killing baddies will determine what upgrades and new traps you get access to. If your boots are on the ground doing more killing than your traps, you'll get access to powers that make enemies more vulnerable to your melee attacks. Use a particular trap that summons a vicious hell beast to fight anything that walks past? Kill enough baddies with him, and you'll get the ability to summon a group of archers to fight at long range. There's a pretty extensive number of upgrades to earn, and the game hits the sweet spot of doling out just enough experience and skill points after matches to feel like you've earned them, without being able to run completely roughshod over the game. There's also a plain old RPG store where you can buy armor, weapons, and accessories, as well as a compulsory crafting system that was used all of once in my playthrough and then ignored. Still, there's no lack of options for players to get their gameplay just how they like it."", ""Problematically, Deathtrap runs out of content the second it really starts to take off. It happens around the fifth or sixth stage, which is the point at which the game seems to run out of new enemies to throw at you and just starts giving the older, bigger ones more HP. Completing the 13th and final stage after a couple of hours of play earns you nothing, unless you count the unlocking of five specialized scenario maps. Deathtrap's roots as an overblown minigame show here. There are a few twists that you can use to try to keep the stages fresh. Getting to level 15 opens up the Scenario mode, which allows you to put new restrictions on each stage (e.g., less Essence regeneration in exchange for more gold/XP at the end), and the Endless mode, which is a non-stop survival mode where Essence is shorter in supply and the monsters are greater in number. There's a level editor that might yield some quality if the game takes off, as well as multiplayer co-op and versus modes, all of which are fun, but it still has you replaying the same stages over and over. There's no fanfare or reward for beating the stages as they currently are, just the pressing urge to earn more XP and open up the level-20 traps."", ""The good news is that Deathtrap is compelling enough that loading it up once in a blue moon to explode some monsters could end up being extremely appealing and fun. It's a nifty little time-waster that Neocore's created here, and while there could and should be a lot more content in the future, the game we've got right now nonetheless makes a convincing bid for your time.""]"Daniel Hindes,12-Mar-15,There Came an Echo Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/there-came-an-echo-review/1900-6416052/,4,PC,"['When I play There Came An Echo, I feel like an idiot. I\'m sitting in a room, alone, and talking to my PC. ""Miranda, move to alpha three,"" I say to my squad member in a snippy tone one would use to tell a dog to \'drop it\'--in fact, it\'s the same tone I use to frustratingly say ""Xbox, on"" before just reaching for its power button. Sometimes, my PC listens, and Miranda chirps an affirmative confirmation before moving into position. At other times, nothing happens, and I have to wait a moment before trying the vocal command again--this time, slightly louder; this time, it\'s more of a demand. ""Miranda. Move. To. Alpha. Three.""', '""You\'re a little too loud,"" the in-game character says, as she fails to react to my command once again. This only amplifies my frustration, making it harder to deliver my next order in a ""quiet and collected manner"" as the loading screen tips suggest. In There Came An Echo\'s real-time tactical battles, simply getting characters to move to appropriate spots on the top-down map can be an ordeal. That\'s because the game can be played almost entirely through voice control--aside from using the mouse or the arrow keys to pan the camera, every order can be spoken into a microphone. You can tell your units to move into position, focus on targets, switch weapons, and even queue up actions by following any command with ""On my mark..."".', ""When it all works, the game offers the kind of battlefield commander fantasy that is lost when just pointing and clicking to issue orders with the mouse. In order for it to work, there are so many factors that need to be just right. You need to issue the command at the right volume. You must clearly enunciate every syllable. Your microphone needs to be the correct distance from your mouth. There can't be too much background noise. On top of those, you'll need to spend a few missions calibrating the voice recognition system using the in-game options. Unfortunately, even with all these factors taken into account, the failure rate for voice commands being recognised is high enough to shatter that commander fantasy multiple times each mission."", ""There Came An Echo feels like it has been designed to allow for a degree of non-responsiveness. Characters exchange fire with futuristic energy weapons, whilst coming equipped with shields that absorb a significant amount of hits before you need to start worrying about their safety. Combat isn't fast and brutal; instead, you'll be whittling down health bars at a slow pace that plays nicely into the time it takes to issue vocal orders."", ""Your actual tactical freedom, however, is limited. You do not have direct control over your small squad; they can only be ordered to move to pre-determined waypoints on the map. Those waypoints are placed in obvious locations, and serve to dictate the way in which each encounter will play out. You occasionally have the opportunity to flank units and whittle their health down faster, or switch between slightly different weapon types, but by the time you're able to get the voice recognition system to work, the encounter is usually over--the enemies are dead, or all your squad members are down."", 'The failure rate for voice commands being recognised is high enough to shatter that commander fantasy', ""Though the voice commands are There Came An Echo's primary method of control, the same orders can also be issued with the mouse. You have no greater direct control over your units, however. Instead, you simply select text versions of the same voice commands from a radial menu. It's evident that there is no deeper quality to the game's tactical engagements when the problematic voice control system is removed. Once the novelty of having your voice recognised by the game wears off, there is little here to propel you through each mission."", 'The cutscenes that bookend each encounter don\'t fill that void, either. Though the voice acting is above average, the writing has characters constantly bickering and arguing over nothing, regularly cutting each other off and telling each other to ""shut up"" both in and out of missions. It feels like a woeful imitation of Archer\'s screwball character comedy antics. This dialogue also jars with the otherwise dark and serious nature of the convoluted plot, which deals with issues of over-surveillance and paranoia through excessive techno-babble.', ""Though the plot is poorly delivered, it provides an appropriate context for the role you assume as the omniscient commander. There is an eerie sensation when you realise your PC is actually listening to you. Unfortunately, far too often, it simply isn't.""]"Austin Walker,11-Mar-15,Code Name: S.T.E.A.M.

On the deck of the United States Airship Lady Liberty, Tom Sawyer, the Not-so-Cowardly Lion, Tiger Lily (from Peter Pan), and John Henry (the steel-driving man) watch as a giant robot modeled after (and piloted by) Abraham Lincoln stomps through the streets, clenching its metallic fists. It squares off against a massive creature, all tentacles and pustules and eyes. This diverse group--white, black, male, female, human, animal--have beaten back the alien menace in the streets, and now it is up to Lincoln to deliver a knockout blow.', 'I should love this. Code Name: S.T.E.A.M. is a tactical game that teams up folkloric heroes and public domain favorites and sets them against Lovecraftian invaders in a series of turn-based skirmishes. Really, I should love this. But I cant because Code Name: S.T.E.A.M. squanders all that potential. A combination of design flaws, technical limitations, and narrative missteps renders what shouldve been a memorable game into something utterly forgettable. A world that should be brimming with character and charm is instead dry and flat. Battles that should feel exciting and dangerous are monotonous at best and frustrating at worst.', 'A world that should be brimming with character and charm is instead dry and flat.', 'These battles make up the majority of Code Name: S.T.E.A.M.s 20 or so hours. You fly from fight to fight, watch a cutscene, and then direct a squad of four characters through cities, secret facilities, and other locales. Taking a page from games like Valkyria Chronicles, S.T.E.A.M. gives you real-time, third-person control of your characters, one at a time. You are allotted an amount of steam (read: action points) based on the characters equipment loadout. You spend this steam to move from tile to tile and to attack enemies. Like some other recent tactics games, smart play means setting up chokepoints and utilizing a defensive overwatch mode to blast aliens once they move into view. You can also use character-specific special abilities (that come with their own unique animations). The whole thing is great on paper, but developer Intelligent Systems fumbles too much of the execution.', 'One example: Though the maps are tiled, you can shuffle characters around inside these tiles without spending any additional steam, so if you park Queequeg (yes, from Moby Dick) behind a giant crate with his final steam point, you can still slide him around inside that tile to line up a sneaky shot (on an aliens glowing weak point, you hope). The problem is that, while youre manually lining up these attacks, your targets bounce up and down in an idle animation, drifting in and out of your reticle. And since the game only checks to see whether your attack was lined up at the second you pulled the trigger, sometimes youre left watching your bullets literally pass through an alien, no damage done.', 'There are other problems, too. Occasionally, an area-of-effect attack or heal might fail to land on one of the targets clearly within its zone of effect. Theres no way to tell whether an enemy is in overwatch mode (this is especially frustrating with a late-game enemy type that is itself immune to overwatch attacks). Then, after spending all that time trying to mitigate these risks, you have to wait for what feels like an eternity for the enemy side to take its turn. Because the view stays locked on your characters, youre stuck staring at John Henry standing in a corner for 30 to 40 seconds while you vaguely hear aliens moving in the distance. When its your turn again, youre left to swing the camera around wildly, hoping to divine what the hell happened halfway across the map. You have to do this because unlike the aforementioned Valkyria Chronciles, Code Name S.T.E.A.M. never gives you a clear, top-down map view of whats happening on the field.', 'While youre manually lining up these attacks, your targets bounce up and down in an idle animation, drifting in and out of your reticle.', 'All of this encourages slow, careful play, not because the tactical challenges are tough and need a lot of thought but because an unpredictable and glitchy result can throw your whole plan into disarray at any moment. It doesnt help that there is very little encouragement to speed through levels or to take interesting risks. With rare exceptions, there is no urgency in Code Name: S.T.E.A.M., just a slow, dreary march forward.', 'It isnt just the combat design thats disappointing. The music is a grating mashup of industrial percussion, thrash guitars, dubstep breaks, and the occasional (and truly out-of-place) flute melody. The maps are boxy and claustrophobic--they all feel like warehouses, even those styled to look like city parks and desert canyons. While your team members are bold, comic-book interpretations of classic characters, the aliens just feel like indistinct blue splotches. Despite their visual flair, even your pulpy heroes begin to wear thin after a dozen hours of hearing the same four or five lines repeated in combat.', 'At the end of the day, all of this could be forgivable if Code Name: S.T.E.A.M. offered something else special. The best games in the tactics genre do this in a variety of ways. XCOM: Enemy Unknown couples the strong combat missions with a smart strategic layer, but S.T.E.A.M. just ushers you from fight to fight. Valkyria Chronicles has interesting progression mechanics for upgrading your troops and vehicles, but in S.T.E.A.M., your characters never level up or change, and though you can unlock new secondary weapons and steam boilers by finding collectibles in the levels, 90% of these are totally inessential. Fire Emblem: Awakening--also available on the 3DS--offers hours and hours of fun interactions with a huge roster of characters. S.T.E.A.M.s story, on the other hand, is a utilitarian structure: the pre- and post-fight cutscenes are beautifully rendered but give little space for the characters to breathe or interact.', 'Code Name: S.T.E.A.M. offers the most frustrating kind of steampunk: It brushes up against potent themes, but then turns its back on them in favor of pure aestheticization.', ""That may be the biggest disappointment of all. Intelligent Systems pulled together an interesting set of figures to star in Code Name: S.T.E.A.M. (including some that were totally new to me, like Califia, the black warrior queen of the mythical island of California). But these arent characters, really: Theyre just sketches. Theyre C-tier Saturday morning cartoon characters. They have great visual design, signature attacks, and a little personality, but that's it."", 'While its incredible to see such a diverse range of characters on screen at the same time, the game is also filled with cringe-worthy stereotypes: the Native American who heals with the power of nature; the Pacific Islander who speaks in broken English; the exotic and mysterious Latina. (And before you say that theyre just staying true to the original depictions of these characters, know that one of them is a gender-swapped Zorro. So no, sorry, they arent.) More than anything, though, I wish that these characters had been fleshed out more. If youre going to put John Henry, Tom Sawyer, and Abe Lincoln on an airship together, please do something interesting with them.', 'Every now and then, there is a glimmer of something really cool: a throw-away line hints at tension between John Henry and the non-human members of S.T.E.A.M.; a newspaper clipping notes worker revolts springing up around fears of automation; an evocative reference is made to Lincolns fateful day in the theater--and his survival of those events. These little hints of flavor kept me interested for a while. I was waiting for some big thematic shift or an interesting twist. Unfortunately, it never came. This is just a story of American do-gooders out to save the world with their near-magical technology.', 'Code Name: S.T.E.A.M. offers the most frustrating kind of steampunk: It brushes up against potent themes, but then turns its back on them in favor of pure aestheticization. When used well, steampunk can be great: Games like 80 Days and Dishonored use steampunk to examine the complexity of emerging technology and massive social change. But in S.T.E.A.M., all we have is American exceptionalism, technological fetishism, and the tiniest dash of diversity training. Yet there is one upside in all this: because all of these characters exist in the public domain, one day, someone will return to this idea. I only hope that theyll spend a little more time fleshing out the world and its inhabitants. And making a targeting system that works.', ' ']"Justin Clark,10-Mar-15,Shelter 2 Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/shelter-2-review/1900-6416055/,6,PC,"[""Nothing is ever so frustrating as watching a good idea go to waste. Well, the original Shelter wasn't necessarily a waste so much as a wonderful idea that felt hamstrung by playing it safe. You played as a mother badger just trying to feed her kids and keep them alive through a host of natural dangers. The game's problems were its linearity and short length. There was no room for improvisation or exploration in Shelter. It was the Disney World on-rails version of what it was like to be prey in a world full of predators. And yet, it's an idea we don't see enough of, especially in the wake of something like Goat Simulator, which aims for humor rather than the simple, silent drama that is nature doing its thing. In addition, Shelter had a unique art style, that looked like the whole thing took place on a quilt that someone built a papercraft forest on, while gentle string instruments provided the score. It had a National Geographic Presents: Tearaway vibe that caught the eyes and ears. It was an idea that had room to grow."", ""Shelter 2 would seem to have everything that the first game needed to be something special. The art design and musical motifs set by the first game remain the same. However, Shelter 2 has you playing as a lynx, which places you smack dab in the middle of the food chain, meaning you can be both predator or prey at any given moment. After the game's intro, where a mother lynx gives birth to four adorable cubs, instead of being blatantly urged on down a grassy corridor, you're set loose on a huge, forested open world to hunt for food to bring back to your mewling brood until they're grown enough to follow you out."", ""It's still a simple, functional set of mechanics powering the game. One button runs, as long as you have the stamina to do so; one button bites and roars to call your brood to you; and one button allows you to sniff the air and see prey highlighted in red in front of you if you hold it, and allows you to eat and drink if you just tap it. If you do break into a sprint, there's a button that allows you to leap. There's a map that works in an abstract sense, where blank space fills out with a sort of aboriginal representation of the terrain as you travel."", ""Life as a lynx primarily involves stalking prey and making sure all your cubs stay fed, Periodic title cards, representing this game's stages, come up over time explaining the lifecycle of your brood from clumsy cubs to lithe, confident teenagers who chase down prey on their own during your journey. Finally, your fully grown progeny splits entirely from you, their mother, leaving you to return to the original den on your own. Despite the open world, there's really only one other thing to do besides eat in this game, and that's follow the marks in your sniffing mode, telling you where the next area is, meaning once again, Shelter is a walking and eating simulator, with very little to break the cycle. You can pick which direction you can start out in, but all it does is bring you through the same areas in a different direction."", ""The new challenges come mostly from your food. Unlike the first game, your prey is very much alive, and it is literally fast food. There's no targeting button. There's no button allowing your lynx to stalk through underbrush, though the game will inconsistently do it for you if you get close enough, and if there are bushes in the terrain, you can use them for stealth as well. Most of the time, however, you're just breaking into a sprint, and hoping your meal doesn't outrun you or take a sudden, sharp left turn to where you can't track them. Bigger prey like deer show themselves early on, and smaller animals involve just taking a swipe as you get close; bigger animals require a full on leaping takedown, which is probably the most fun part of the game, but it happens infrequently. The placement of prey appears to be randomized each playthrough, meaning the frozen lake where the deer are drinking in one playthrough may be a barren, foodless waste of time the next."", ""Therein lies most of the tension in Shelter 2. The open world allows the mother and her brood to traverse the landscape in whatever pattern they wish, and while it means there's plenty of room to chase around prey and explore, it also means long stretches where there's no prey at all, where all you can really do is hope that the kids hold out until their next meal. This is never under your control. You can tell when hunger's starting to set in by how whiny the cubs start to get--and the whine when one of them finally collapses from starvation is a heartbreaking one--but there's no surefire way to really rectify that situation because you never know what's over the next ridge. It could be a nest of delicious, life-sustaining rabbits. It could be absolutely nothing, meaning you've wasted precious stamina you'll need to chase down actual food when it shows up."", ""The rest of the tension comes later, when you hear the howling of wolves in the distance, which means it's time to run like hell for higher ground. Without fail, I've lost at least one cub every time I've reached the wolves, and yet each time, I've never seen exactly which wolves took it down. I can't tell if that's more frightening or not."", 'Shelter 2 places you smack dab in the middle of the food chain, meaning you can be both predator or prey at any given moment.', ""None of this is particularly bad, but it's also painfully simple. There's a cycle of seasons and time in the game, so when the ground and trees turn white and the waters freeze, my instinct is to find actual shelter for the pack, not realizing that that's an easy way to starve to death, since leaving the initial area usually involves a 10-minute push back to the starting point. When my prey ran off into the forest, my response was to try climbing into the trees to pounce from above. Also not an option. There's a not-really-explained mechanic when you've killed an animal that appears to allow you to cover up the remains, which I figured would come into play later to prevent the wolves from tracking the rest of my pack, but sure enough, they found me, a few minutes later, despite this. The original Shelter's problems have not been fixed. In giving us a far more complex but familiar creature, Shelter's ambitions have grown, but the execution has not grown with them. This big, beautiful open world that's been created is prime to do something with a sandbox besides cramming it with minigames, but its never taken advantage of. And just like the first game, it's over right as it feels like it begins, a shade over an hour total from beginning to end, though with no poetic post-script this time to dull the disappointment."", ""And so, we're left with a game that woefully undercooks its concept, a partial success in that nothing that the game does is particularly bad, but for a concept that has always felt like a no-brainer, why didn't somebody think of that before situation, the fact that it doesn't do some fairly obviously things to make the game earn its price tag is disheartening. Shelter, as a series, has the right spirit, the right ideas, and it is once again hamstrung by its inability to go the extra, needed mile to do them justice."", ' ']"Danny O'Dwyer,10-Mar-15,Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hotline-miami-2-wrong-number-review/1900-6416049/,9,PC,"[""Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number's action is so loud and intense that upon hitting the pause button, reality feels like it's playing at half speed. It's the type of experience that invites you to sit closer to the screen and crank up the volume higher than usual. One of the lingering memories of the first game was its heart-pounding techno soundtrack, so allow me to get this out of the way: The music in Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number is absolutely outstanding. But to revel in the game's slick style too much would be a disservice to its ferociously entertaining and challenging top-down action. This is a confident follow-up which improves upon the original in almost every way. Hotline Miami 2 is more varied, paced better, fairer, and more challenging. This is a tremendously stylish game which entertains throughout, and delights in forcing you out of your comfort zone."", ""Hotline Miami 2 is a top-down twitch shooter in which you play as one of many available psychopaths who, for an assortment of reasons, are required to enter various buildings and kill everyone therein. You commit these massacres using a variety of weapons: shotguns, automatic rifles, silenced pistols, knives, pipes, and even your fists. But regardless of the delivery method, death comes quick. Don't expect to soak up damage or pick up health packs. This is a game in which a single bullet can kill you and your foes, and in which on-your-toes tactics and a quick trigger finger mean the difference between completing a level and respawning over and over and over."", 'The intense visuals thumping techno soundtrack, and score multiplier will seduce you into risking it all in one glorious, foolhardy charge.', ""How you choose to clear each area in the game's thirty-or-so levels is largely up to you. You can run and gun with reckless abandon or use a loud shotgun burst to lure nearby enemies into your path. Maybe you'd prefer to use a door to knock-out enemies and finish them off silently. Whichever method of murder you choose, the engagements are exhilarating. Though planning your attack will net the best results, the intense visuals, thumping techno soundtrack, and score multiplier will seduce you into risking it all in one glorious, foolhardy charge. Hotline Miami 2 is a high-saturation feast for the eyes, where points burst out of fallen enemies as the screen tilts and sways to the movement of your character. The game's striking color palette and VCR motif evoke the in-your-face TV style of the late 80s and early 90s. Each level's floors, walls, and furnishings are vibrantly colored, though by the time you've finished any given level, much of it is painted an electric crimson."", ""While the first game was centered around a single mask-swapping protagonist massacring operations run by the Russian Mafia, Hotline Miami 2 darts back and forth between dozens of characters and locations. At one moment, you're a journalist attempting to use non-lethal takedowns in a subway station; At the next, you're a soldier using a flamethrower to incinerate enemy forces in Hawaii. While you spend a lot of time running around buildings, there's far more more variety in terms of level design. Halls and rooms have more interesting angles, extra windows, more open areas, and multiple lanes for enemies to approach from: while better enemy placement creates increased diversity in the types of engagements you'll encounter. The melee-resistant dogs return, as do fat enemies which are impervious to anything other than bullets. But they're joined by bullet-ducking samurai, running enemies who leap to close the distance, and a selection of level-specific mini-bosses. This is a game about planning your engagements and reacting to how the enemies attack. With more diverse levels populated with better placed and more varied foes, Hotline Miami 2 becomes a far more entertaining and challenging experience than its predecessor."", ' ', 'Hotline Miami 2 darts back and forth between dozens of characters and locations.', ""This ever-shifting pace and variety allows Hotline Miami 2 to be more restrictive in other ways. While the first game gave you the freedom to select a mask--and thus, a special ability--before each level, the character choices here are a lot more rigid--and this is to the game's credit. Though you can sometimes choose from a small selection of weapons, or select a specific sociopath, the story typically forces you to play a particular character. No longer can you choose the Tony the Tiger mask to silently take down people in every single level."", ""Instead, the game encourages you to get better at shooting by forcing you to play as more run and gun characters. For instance, Mark the Bear uses two machine guns, holding them out at arm's length, John Woo style, when you press the alternate fire button. My personal favorite character, however, is actually a swan-mask-wearing duo--Alex and Ash--who runs with a chainsaw in the front, and guns in the back. While you can always use the lock-on button to cue up shots ahead of time, there's a spectacular joy in chainsawing one group of enemies while popping off reinforcements as they enter the room. These are a but a handful of the dozen-or-so characters you'll play as during Hotline Miami 2's campaign."", ""So what is there to say about the story? There's a lot more of it, for one. The first third of the game has you sitting through long periods of confusing exposition that do little to clarify exactly what's going on. But even when Hotline Miami's story eventually finds its pace, you're probably not going to be taken aback by the narrative. The original game intentionally obfuscated what was going on behind an unreliable narrator and secret endings, and much of that continues here. Callbacks to the first game, shifts in perspective, and furious timeline swapping make the story read better on a second playthrough. The story's main success is in creating a surreal experience that's best enjoyed by letting the specifics wash over you."", ' ', 'In almost every way, Hotline Miami 2 is a marked improvement on an already tremendous formula.', ""Hotline Miami 2 is a challenging, often difficult, game, but playing through it's varied levels is so enjoyable that dying rarely feels like punishment. The game's grading system gives you an excuse to return to levels, but its neon-hot style is an even more inviting reason to play again and again. The experience is so audiovisually seductive that you find yourself replaying zones just for the sake of it. Hotline Miami 2's vibrant palette, outlandish early 90s style, and intense music make it difficult to resist. The soundtrack sees returning artists such as Perturbator and Jasper Bryne supply a breadth of synth and techno tracks, alongside a host of new musicians. Smooth post-rock guitar stylings find a home beside heartwarming house beats and a particularly threatening dubstep number. Not only is the music as exceptional as the first game's, but there's also a lot more of it."", ""Actually, there's a lot more of everything: I completed the original Hotline Miami in about three hours, but by the time Hotline Miami 2's credits had rolled, I'd registered almost nine. Of course, this was before I had started over with the unlockable hard mode, which adds enemies and removes the ability to lock on shots--and before I had toyed around with the game's level editor, which is currently in the alpha testing stage."", ""In almost every way, Hotline Miami 2 is a marked improvement on an already tremendous formula. This is a game that had me pumping my fists and laughing with joy throughout my time with it, and I was left despondent by the time it drew to a close.

Say what you will about just how much people actually notice frame rate and resolution, but for games that value split-second timing, those extra 30 frames are essential. It's partly why I spent more time with the hack 'n' slash classic DmC: Devil May Cry on PC than with its slower console counterparts, the sharper visuals and general feeling of superiority being a nice added bonus. So here we are, two years on, and console owners can finally get a taste of that sweet 60fps action, courtesy of the Definitive Edition--and it's a fantastic thing. DmC is fiercely creative, and with its new features in tow, so much better than before."", ""Oddly, it's the story that's surpassed expectations here (excluding the still dire effort in the included Vergil's Downfall DLC)--not because it was ever bad, but it was always overshadowed by the stellar combat. Playing through it again, though, it's amazing to see just how ambitious and, at times, rather clever, it is. Let's not forget that, as a series, Devil May Cry didn't exactly set the world on fire with its schlocky tales of adolescent fantasy. But with DmC, Ninja Theory crafted a story with depth, (mostly) believable characters, and an ambitious assault on commercialism and modern media. The game's savage satirization of organisations like Fox News with the demonic Bob Barbas' Raptor News Network and Coca-Cola with the bile-infested and thoroughly deadly soft drink Virility is a great touch."", ""Small plot holes and a few heavy-handed moments of satire aside, DmC's story does a great job of crafting a foreboding atmosphere to back up its balls-to-the-wall action, especially when coupled with the excellent voice acting and effortless dialogue. The demon king Mundus and his mistress Lilith are particular highlights, their ruthless, profanity-filled crusade to enslave humankind being a hackneyed, yet effective way of adding a compelling goal to your hack 'n' slash antics."", ""DmC throws you from one action set piece to the next at a breakneck pace, only giving you time to stop and think during its tedious (but thankfully short-lived) platforming sections. But even in those sections and through its crumbling blood-red cityscapes, cavernous tunnels lined with a viscous green ooze and searing neon discos, it's hard to ignore DmC's stylistic triumphs. Its colorful, oversaturated look is not only visually stunning in its new 1080p guise but also strangely prescient of the direction that later Xbox One and PlayStation 4 games would take."", ""While it's hindsight that has made DmC's story more impressive, the already excellent combat has improved by a significant overhaul. Naturally, the move from 30 to 60 frames per second makes for a smoother, more responsive experience. With Dante's trifecta of light, medium, and heavy weapon types in tow, as well as guns for ranged shots, spectacular combos fly off the fingers with less effort than before. That's not to say that things are easier this time around: you still need to put in the effort in practice mode, carefully studying the command list, in order to graduate from simple button mashing. But it's worthwhile, and before long, staccato stabbing motions are replaced with elegant swipes, dodges, and uppercuts that chain together for near-endless combos in the air and on the ground."", ""60fps is only part of the story. One of the best additions is the optional turbo mode (a nod to Capcom's flagship franchise Street Fighter), which boosts game speed by a substantial 20 percent. It's not for the faint-hearted, but the additional speed makes for some furious and thoroughly enjoyable combat. There's also the optional Hardcore mode--which can be activated on any difficulty level--that rebalances the game. Some of the changes include a tweaked style system that quickly deteriorates, increased enemy damage, adjusted parry and evade windows, and a shorter devil trigger. The differences aren't drastic enough to be immediately noticeable, but soon, levels that might not have tested you in the past become far more difficult to beat. Annoyingly, if you've played through the game before on an older console and have already unlocked the harder difficulty levels, you can't transfer your save and skip, and youll have to play through the easier ones again."", ""Serious masochists can opt to turn on the Must Style modifier, which makes it so that you can't damage enemies until you've achieved an S or higher style ranking by pulling off sweet combos. Stack all the modes and modifiers together (Must Style, Hardcore, and Turbo Mode), then whack the game on the new Gods Must Die difficulty setting where enemies deal 2.5x damage and no items are allowed, and the game turns into a challenge worthy of even the most skilled of hack 'n' slash players. There's also the new Vergil's Bloody Palace mode, which eschews the easier difficulty levels of Dante's Bloody Palace and gives you 60 levels of hardcore arena battles. Veteran Devil May Cry fans can even choose to use manual lock-on throughout, which is a nice touch. Frankly, that level of challenge goes far beyond my own manual dexterity with a controller, even after buying new combos and weapon upgrades, but at least now, no one can cry foul about DmC not being as challenging as its predecessors."", ""Otherwise, DmC remains largely unchanged, which is no bad thing. The enemies remain neatly animated, drooling and sputtering with a grizzly black ooze as they wander through each level. Their varying attacks mean that you can't just sit back and hammer buttons to win. Some enemies have shields that can only be broken with a heavy weapon, while others need the gentler touch of a fast-paced scythe. Deformed cherubs that fling down explosive bombs are perhaps the most irritating of all of the enemies, but they're integral to maintaining the balance of combat. They also give you a good excuse to yank them down to Earth with a whip of your chain before sending them back to hell with a mighty swing of your axe."", ""Time has been kind to DmC's boss battles, too. They're still formulaic, making you learn a boss's repetitive movements in order to land an attack, but they're seriously impressive--both visually and narratively. An early encounter with the squishy succubus is a treat--not because of the basic platforming required to defeat her but because of her incredibly foul-mouthed tirades and involuntary neon vomiting. Then there's the battle against a holographic Bob Barbas, a fight that sees you transported to the heart of the Raptor News Network and directly into its live news reports, complete with the requisite TV commentary and helicopter shots. DmC's keen sense of style overcomes much of the boss battles' shortcomings, adding to the heady atmosphere of its brightly coloured world."", ""I imagine there are still some people out there put off by the direction that Ninja Theory took with DmC who still haven't given the game a shot because it so drastically changed the look of the series. This does the game a huge disservice. DmC in its Definitive Edition form isn't just a lick of paint and a technical upgrade. It's a hardcore twist on already impressive game, making the hack 'n' slash action more difficult, but also more compelling than before. The numerous tweaks and upgrades of DmC: Devil May Cry Definitive Edition have made a game that isn't just a better version of DmC, but a bonafide hack 'n' slash classic.""]"Peter Brown,10-Mar-15,Resident Evil: Revelations 2 Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-revelations-2-episode-three-review/1900-6416057/,8,Xbox One,"[""Resident Evil: Revelations 2 has had some great moments over the course of two episodes, but not consistently so. In Episode One, Barry and Natalia stole the show with an eerie trip through the woods, but only after you suffered through fetch quests and awful dialogue as Claire and Moira. However, when those two were confronted by mobs of enemies and had to fight their way out of a logging village in Episode Two, their side of the story was suddenly the interesting half, as Barry and Natalia did little more than retrace their counterparts' steps."", ""Coming off of Episode Two's dull second half, Episode Three is pure delight, if you can apply that word to the trials and horrors that lie within. It kicks off when Claire and Moira wander through a derelict meat processing plant, a location that's rife with ghastly sights left over from the factory's final days. Blood is in steady supply, and you eventually find yourself waist deep in pools of the red stuff as pig carcasses dangle overhead, a cheerful sight if there ever was one. You get a strong sense of dread as you work your way through the plant, all the while contending with puzzles and mutants. This is par for the course in Resident Evil, but for the first time in Revelations 2, the puzzles are actually interesting, which is more than can be said for those in episodes One and Two."", ""At one point, an eye scanner prevents you from progressing, and if Hollywood is anything to go by, you know what you must do: steal someone's eye! That's technically the case here, but it's a little more complicated than that, with smaller puzzles to tackle along the way. When you enter a room with red security lasers crisscrossed about, you might expect that you need to contort your body and slip through the gaps, and while that would be an interesting feat, this scenario is actually a good chance for Moira to prove her worth, using her flashlight to highlight a path that will take her safely through. Of course, Claire's perfectly capable of using a flashlight, so it's still weird that only Moira can take advantage of her torch, but given that, using her in this way is far better than simply using her as a second set of hands to pull a lever. That's not to say this doesn't happen in Episode Three; it does. However, at least it's not the only thing she's good for."", ""As in so many Resident Evil games, you rely on conveniently but unexplainably placed objects or features to resolve puzzles in Episode Three--a clear reminder that you're playing a video game--but this habit has a certain charm to it when handled properly. I don't know why there's a room with spikes on the ceiling that slowly drop towards the floor, but here, it's an opportunity to use your intellect in a way that's different than simply managing ammo and working on your aim, so you embrace its existence rather than question it. It's not immediately apparent what you need to do, but you ultimately need to put yourself in harms way and take advantage of the spikes. It's only by the powers of deduction that you arrive at this conclusion, and the risk involved adds an appreciable layer of tension, which makes it easy to forgive and forget the unrealistic and contrived nature of these scenarios."", ""Moira has been a thorn in my side for most of Revelations 2, mostly due to her annoying dialogue, but also because you're forced to use her in uninteresting ways. However, a chaotic scene towards the end of her act in Episode Three gives credence to her presence and her partnership with Claire, at least from a game design perspective. A difficult situation sends the two characters on different paths within the same room, which is built to kill, and kill it will, unless you manage to persevere under pressure by executing commands with careful timing and accuracy. It's easier said than done, primarily because the environment is so volatile, and while one character is trying to diminish that particular threat, the other is going toe-to-toe with incoming enemies."", ""Switching between Claire and Moira is a high-stakes juggling act, and you finally get the sense that they're relying on one another to survive. Sure, Moira's always been able to assist Claire during battle by blinding enemies with her flashlight or whacking them with her crowbar, but it's not until now that you feel like Claire truly needs Moira, which is an important element of any sidekick. If the main character doesn't need their sidekick to swoop in and save them from time to time, her presence will ultimately feel like a burden. Finally, Revelations 2 bucks that trend when it comes to Moira."", ""Like Claire, Barry relies on his partner, Natalia, far more than he's had to before. Section by section, the duo works together to clear a path through a sewer, but also to safely and efficiently take out large groups of enemies. Primarily, Barry needs Natalia to run along a catwalk in order to open gates that stand in his way, but she can also make Barry's life easier by pushing explosive tanks into the water below."", ""This setup lets Barry lure enemies into a trap that can be triggered with a single bullet, efficiently clearing a path instead of exhausting your precious resources on individual enemies. There are deterrents, such as a dormant monster next to a tank that will wake up if Natalia gets too close, but this is a chance for Barry to give Natalia backup by picking off the threat from below. After an initial pause, you remember that teamwork's an option and send her into the path of danger for the greater good of the team. These kinds of moments are the best examples of how it can be interesting for an individual to control two characters, which Revelations 2 has struggled with thus far."", 'Before episode three wraps, you need to complete a mundane puzzle with Barry, who must repeatedly and slowly move a large object from one location to another. After a couple of great hours of solid tension and fulfilling teamwork, this filler comes as a bit of a letdown. A few enemy encounters along the way prevent it from being completely boring, but regardless, you get the feeling that Episode Three would have been served better if it went out with a bang instead of a whimper, even at the cost of its overall length.', ""As the final chapter in Revelations 2 nears, it's a relief to see the story progress in leaps and bounds during Episode Three. Such moments are long overdue. You learn a great deal about hidden motives, and witness the consequences of certain characters' actions, which stirs up complex emotions among other cast members. Given that there's only one more episode to go, it feels a bit like it's too little too late, but that will ultimately depend on where the story goes in the final episode. Thankfully, there are still some unanswered questions to explore in next week's episode, but as far as Episode Three is concerned, the events at hand are an excellent compliment to the overall great gameplay."", ""Even though Barry's final stint is a letdown, with payoff after payoff, Episode Three is easily the best episode of Revelations 2 yet. It no longer feels like it was designed in such a way that forcefully attempts to justify having a partner. Instead, your appreciation for your sidekicks comes organically as you work together to solve interesting puzzles and protect each other from danger. Controlling Moira and Natalia no longer feels like a chore; now, it's a privilege, and Episode Three's greatest feat overall.""]"Kevin VanOrd,9-Mar-15,Ori and the Blind Forest Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ori-and-the-blind-forest-review/1900-6416053/,9,Xbox One,"[""The first ten minutes of Ori and the Blind Forest depict a beautiful and soul-crushing story of friendship, selflessness, and loss. They recall the opening minutes of Pixar's Up! in their melancholy, and like in Up!, the introduction provides an emotional foundation for the life-affirming journey that follows. It is a phenomenal opening--a short and wordless tale, playacted by two expressive characters who move with purpose and demonstrate pure affection towards each other."", ""There's a certain elegance to the game's initial sorrow, and it translates to the way you move through this exquisite 2D platformer. Ori and The Blind Forest is, on a fundamental level, structured as so many other platformers are; It springs from the Metroid and Castlevania tradition, gating your progress behind doors that can only be opened once you have learned a particular skill. As the nimble, lemurlike Ori, you leap and flit about with fantastic grace, and as Ori's abilities improve, so do the joys of navigating his world. When you learn how to climb walls, Ori responds wonderfully to subtle movements of the analog stick, allowing you to finesse him into exactly the right place, such as a sliver of stone embedded within a sea of lava. When you earn your double-jump, Ori somersaults like an acrobat and reacts in mid-air to your aftertouch. What a delight to have such fine control over a character this agile."", ""One by one, you learn new skills, and new challenges arrive with them. Ori can fire energy orbs at nearby foes when he isn't avoiding them completely, and those creatures can be difficult to overcome. The blobs that stick to walls and ceilings? They aren't much of a hassle, at least until they coat the surfaces you need to cross and spit acid onto the ground. They won't let you stay still: You must take advantage of Ori's dexterity, by leaping over acidic pustules, jumping from wall to wall, or putting the other abilities you have to good use. For instance, you ultimately learn how to deflect projectiles, aiming them back at your foes while propelling yourself in the opposite direction. Turning an oncoming ball of fire back towards its owner is fun, but if you don't pay attention, you could thrust Ori into a wall of spikes, or into a crow hovering nearby."", ""Propelling yourself through the sky in this manner becomes one of Ori and the Blind Forest's most vital maneuvers. When you first learn it, you typically use the glowing lanterns that dangle from overhangs. Soon, however, you must fire Ori through treacherous areas replete with fiery spheres and those pesky crows, which hurl towards you as if launched from a slingshot. Timing is crucial, as is quickly determining the safest trajectory that still delivers you to your destination. That mid-air fling is at the heart of one of the game's most thrilling scenes: a difficult escape from roaring tides that swallow you whole should you make a single grievous error."", ""The trial and error this scene and others require can prove frustrating if you prefer to move on to the next area rather than discover, learn, and adapt. I admit to shouting a few expletives when unforeseen circumstances cut my attempts short, falling boulders with crystalline spikes covering their undersides and perilous geysers that spurted from the walls among them. But what a feeling it is to overcome these challenges. The tightly timed retreats that close each chapter are among the finest joys in any platformer--or any game at all--released in recent years. If Ori were clumsy, or if these sequences weren't timed so precisely, these moments would be simply annoying. But in Ori and the Blind Forest, each element harmonizes with every other. If you run into trouble, the game's save system eases the pain. You gather crystals as you play that function as checkpoints, allowing you to determine where you will respawn if you succumb to a bile-spewing frog. You must take care, however, not to drop these crystals everywhere you go, since you can only carry so many."", 'Those pulse-pounding escapes are complemented by moments of quiet bliss. In time, Ori can break his fall with a leafy parachute, gliding across the screen like a flower petal on the wind. During these moments, it\'s easy to appreciate the game\'s visual artistry. Multiple layers give each environment a lovely sense of depth. As you cross a log that bridges one tunnel to the next, thick trees rise in the background. Embers and fire crackle behind you, giving your trek across the troubled world a sense of urgency and purpose. Luminescent blue plants alternately close and unfurl with each jump, shining and glittering even as they become your next cause of death. It is a fairy tale come to life, a description that has rightfully earned ""cliche"" status--yet rarely is the description so apt as it is in Ori and the Blind Forest.', ""It isn't just the vibrant art and lush orchestral soundtrack that furnish a storybook mood. It's also the story, which is infrequently told to you via subtitles, accompanied by a narrator who chants along in an unknown language, in the style of Okami, or Panzer Dragoon Orta. It is a simple fable about the renewal of a ravaged land; It is in the details that you find the delights worth prizing. A critter that absconds with an important artifact gains importance you don't initially expect, revealing loneliness, fear, and tenderness not with words, but with exaggerated bows and nods. If there is any blight on this atmospheric transcendence, it is the frame rate, which occasionally falters, ever so slightly, in the final hours."", ""It's important, however, not to mistake Ori and the Blind Forest for being simply beautiful. It certainly is--but it is also unceasingly clever. It consistently surprises you with new tricks: gravitational divergences, new ways to move through its spaces, and carefully designed levels that require you to think quickly and respond. It is not as snappy as, say, a typical Mario platformer, seeking instead a broader gameplay arc stretching across a single, interconnected world. It's a superb and thematically consistent approach that allows Ori and the Blind Forest to build joy on a bed of heartache, adding a new layer of mechanical complexity with each ray of hope.""]"Kevin VanOrd,9-Mar-15,Homeworld Remastered Collection Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/homeworld-remastered-collection-review/1900-6416056/,8,PC,"[""Outer space has been famously referred to as the final frontier, but it's a well-worn setting in video games at this stage--even in real-time strategy games. Yet Homeworld refuses to be outdone, beautifully capturing the loneliness of the black void, and then disturbing its eerie allure with the light trails of starfighters engaged in conflict. Returning to this universe in Homeworld Remastered Collection illustrates the series' timelessness. The Homeworld games--and the original in particular--are not just classics in our mind, but classics in practice, standing tall beside any strategy game that dares draw comparisons by being set deep in the cosmos."", ""Like many games set in space, Homeworld and Homeworld 2 remain attractive even through a modern lens, though directly comparing them to their remastered versions reveal their ages. You can still play those original versions in this remastered collection, though the vibrancy of the newly textured ships and sumptuous backgrounds are an inescapable lure. The mothership--your base of operations in any given Homeworld mission or skirmish--is a particular wonder. It creates a striking parabolic silhouette against the starry background, and its center pylon, which is covered with individual light sources, looks like it must house a vast network of engineers and operators. At least, that's true of the original's mothership; Homeworld 2's vast vessel fills in architectural spaces left open in the original, and looks more structurally sound and elegant, prizing practicality over mystery."", ""This sense of mystery is paramount to Homeworld's success. The song by Yes that closed the original Homeworld is gone, though I hardly miss it. The game's true sonic successes were the work of composer Paul Ruskay and an audio team that created a wondrous sound that far surpasses the science fiction New Age cliches that occasionally plague games set in space. The Turanic battle music remains a highlight: Rhythmic drums and nasal reeds pierce through droning electronic tones, impressing upon you the otherworldly nature of your newfound foes--quite a feat given a setting that is, by nature, already otherworldly. Individual sound effects take on similar meaning. Entering and exiting hyperspace emits a sustained, pulsing buzz that becomes the series' call to adventure. The hushed groan and persistent beeps that arise when you press the spacebar to view the overall map emphasizes your place as a commander, drawing parallels to undersea exploration by evoking its sounds. This is iconic audio, immediately recognizable to anyone fortunate enough to play."", ""You may say that it is the gameplay that matters, but this collection's look and sound is vital to each mission's overall feel. Just as the soundtrack slowly unfurls, so too does resource collection. It's a sensibly measured start, given the state of the RTS when Homeworld was released in 1999. Action wasn't typically immediate; World in Conflict hadn't yet been made, and the action-first mentality had yet to overwhelm the genre. This progression is entirely suitable for Homeworld. There's a dreaminess to commanding your resource collectors to mine the nearest asteroids while you cue up your build order and scout out nearby space. Your remaining units transfer from one campaign mission to the next, and reaching your mission objective takes additional time. This gives you a chance to zoom in and admire your bombers as they flit about, and keep an eye on your capital ships as they meander towards their targets."", ""Returning to this universe in Homeworld Remastered Collection illustrates the series' timelessness."", ""Engagements are not over quickly in the remastered original. Even when one force is sure to overpower the other, combat is sustained and vibrant. Swarms of corvettes look like flies buzzing around their quarry, though combining individual units into strike groups makes it easy to keep track of even the lowliest scouts. Once the big guns arrive, the comparisons to naval combat become more pronounced: Frigates line up like battleships, focusing their fire on the enemy's most powerful vessels. Don't let the similarities to naval combat fool you, however. You utilize all three dimensions of space; The gameplay map is an entire sphere, not a 2D grid that fools you into thinking the Z axis has meaningful repercussions on gameplay."", ""Mission pacing builds gradually, requiring you to manage multiple strike groups and be cognizant of each unit's strengths and weaknesses. Some missions are duds, such as a frustrating defensive objective that requires you to destroy asteroids as they approach the mothership. It's a difficult mission, but it's also flat and uninteresting because the tempo remains constant--and because asteroids make for boring enemies when there are entire battalions out in space waiting to be demolished. On the other hand, successfully rescuing friendly forces from a sea of red icons is a rewarding accomplishment, as is wearing down an opposing mothership until it explodes in a flash of particles and fire. (It may not be a realistic depiction of space, but it is certainly a colorful one.) Homeworld introduces new technology and units at a manageable rate, so while there are challenges to face, you're always equipped with the knowledge you need to triumph."", ' ', ""The action isn't exactly as you remembered, as it happens. Perhaps the biggest change is the loss of fuel as a strategic consideration. If your memories of the original game's specifics have dissipated, this may not be a bothersome loss, but infinite fuel means fewer nails bitten when the action heats up. It also makes the presence of Kadeshi fuel pods less sensible: why does the enemy still need to be concerned with refueling, when you do not? Formations don't work as you remember either, with the biggest loss lying with the sphere formation, which now no longer allows you to embed larger ships within an orb of death. Repair ships, meanwhile, must be micromanaged, as they cannot be trusted to provide services of their own accord. This is the original Homeworld viewed through the filter of Homeworld 2, which implemented changes to pathing and projectile damage that don't always feel logical in the earlier game."", ""Moving from Homeworld 1 to Homeworld 2 is a smooth transition, in any case. There are differences, of course: Homeworld 2 was a full-fledged sequel, as opposed to the Cataclysm add-on, which supplemented the first Homeworld, and is sadly missing from this collection. You do not build individual fighters, for instance, but multi-fighter squadrons, and there are more upgrade branches to consider when determining how to spend accumulated credits. Some changes are for the better: You can target individual ship systems, for example, shutting down the opposition's fighter facilities so that they can no longer produce strike craft, or slowing their roll by demolishing the engines."", ""This is the original Homeworld viewed through the filter of Homeworld 2, which implemented changes to pathing and projectile damage that don't always feel logical in the earlier game."", ""Homeworld 2 cuts the original game's post-game resource collection as well, slurping resource units up automatically when the mission ends. The remastered Homeworld allows you to do this as well, granting you nearby resources when you auto-dock and get on your way, though it doesn't always collect everything from the map, so you may still be inclined to send out your collectors to reap. This process isn't exciting, but I find it soothing to relax in this way after a tight series of battles, and then to watch my fighters and ion frigates make their way back to the mothership for manual docking. It emphasizes the melancholy nature of the Hiigaran quest for identity, much of which plays out in poignant black-and-white cinematics. There are scenes of great loss that earn even greater power when the even-voiced narrator breaks his monotone ever so slightly. The Homeworld story is sorrowful at heart, making the coldness of surrounding space a surreal contrast."", ""You can compare the originals with their remasters in this collection, and if you have the gumption to sign up for yet another unnecessary online service, you can also play the multiplayer beta, which, because it is officially still in testing phase, falls outside of the scope of this review. The Homeworld series' legacy, however, has always lain within its story-focused campaigns, whose excellent action and inherent beauty endure and excel, even in light of the 16 years that have passed since the original's arrival. It is a huge universe out there, but Homeworld Remastered Collection makes a great case for asserting your presence within it."", ' ']"Josiah Renaudin,9-Mar-15,Dragon Ball: Xenoverse Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-ball-xenoverse-review/1900-6416054/,6,PS4,"[""You can only tell the same story so many times, and Dragon Ball games are well past their allotment. I've seen Raditz perforated by the Special Beam Cannon more than 100 times by now, and while I love the series' grandiose narrative and iconic moments, it has long needed a spark. Dragon Ball Xenoverse, in spite of its pronounced deficiencies, puts the beloved series back on track. What it lacks in mechanical depth it makes up for in scope and fresh story arcs, and even if you still see Frieza bring Namek to its knees and Cell crumble before a familial Kamehameha, the addition of a customized character shines a new light on scenes that were growing far too dim."", ""It all starts with your own unique Z Warrior. Instead of reenacting the well-worn script as Goku, Piccolo, or another member of the colorful cast, Xenoverse inserts your own hero into each of the classic scenarios. From his species to the shine of his boots, your character's presentation is entirely up to you, and the depth of the adjustable characteristics allows you to successfully craft your ideal fighter. If you want to make a blue-haired lady-Saiyan with a jet-black outfit, the tools are there to make it happen. While stylish, your protagonist is far from verbose--uttering little more than a grunt and the title of a special attack during battle--but it's hard not to grow attached to this silent soldier as he battles alongside the established heroes. As a child who too often pretended that he could shoot energy from his palms and grow golden hair with a flourish, watching my addition to the roster be acknowledged by Goku and company was an inimitable pleasure."", ""After establishing a persona, you're brought in by Trunks as a member of the Time Patrol, a team that travels from era to era, correcting hiccups in the timeline that could radically alter the course of history. The villains meddling within the different timelines create problematic circumstances, diametrically opposed to the regular flow of this world's history. What if Raditz broke Goku's grip and avoided Piccolo's shot to the gullet? What havoc could Frieza have wrought if he immediately transformed to his final form instead of brandishing each of his less impressive molds? It's up to you to battle major characters possessed by an indomitable power and restore the timeline to its rightful progression."", ""Most of what you see, though distorted, follows the established Dragon Ball Z order of events, and if you're unfamiliar with the show, you'll likely find yourself lost among all the spiky hair and massive explosions. Xenoverse expects you already to have an established relationship with the anime, but the latter story missions have characters and content that are entirely new to the universe. It's not always prime material, with the dialogue ranging from fair to dreadful, but it's still refreshing to do new things in a Dragon Ball game. There's a lot to see, and seeing it all through the eyes of someone outside the well-established crew had me rushing to see how the script would be flipped next."", 'Dragon Ball Xenoverse, in spite of its pronounced deficiencies, puts the beloved series back on track.', ""What I didnt always look forward to were the battles, which, unsurprisingly, are the meat of the experience. The combat isn't broken or unpleasant, but it does feel incomplete. Dragon Ball Xenoverse fails to present you with enough effective offensive outlets to remain captivating from start to finish, and while the over-the-shoulder perspective and cinematic ultimate attacks effectively replicate the visual spirit of the show, they just weren't enough to keep me engaged. Employing basic strikes, special attacks, and earth-shattering finishers between your enemy's combos might be effective, but even efficient strategies tend to result in apathy. The more you play, the less novel fighting becomes."", ""On a basic level, combining heavy and light attacks and topping them off with a burst of energy feels satisfying. The fists, elbows, knees, and feet that do connect result in an authoritative thwack, sending bodies flying into splintering mountains. Even the most devastating ability takes no more than three button presses to unleash, so it's simple to pick up the controller and begin punishing your competition with thunderous, destructive skill. However, there's little substance behind the thick layer of theatrics, and pounding away at buttons as you watch enemy health bars slowly tick away grows more tedious over time. It's easy to pick up and easy to master, which makes for a flat, unchallenging experience overall."", ""It's not always prime material, with the dialogue ranging from fair to dreadful."", ""This problem is only exacerbated by the presence of more bodies, and Xenoverse often presents skirmishes with multiple fighters on each side of the battlefield. It's common to jump into three-on-three competitions where you spend too much time putting fist to face with little substantive support from your allies. The speed of the action already makes one-on-one combat feel loose, with your character sporadically swinging at air as your back's to the enemy, so adding two additional targets can make it difficult to control the chaos. When it all works, it's easy to appreciate the bedlam. But these moments of bliss are too often followed by monotony, made frustrating by a less-than-perfect targeting system."", ""The action disappoints, but the methods of progression are both vast and gratifying. Beyond leveling up and applying points to various statistics, you can purchase and use an assortment of clothing and special techniques to empower your fighter. The deeper you progress within the different sagas, the more options you have. It takes time and even a bit of grinding to become powerful enough to conquer Cell or the best Buu, and going from level 25 to 27 often isn't enough to turn the tide of battle. But that didn't stop me from testing new pieces of armor and altering skill sets to search for the most lethal combat concoction."", ""There's little substance behind the thick layer of theatrics, and pounding away at buttons as you watch enemy health bars slowly tick away grows more tedious over time."", 'Alongside the story missions are offline and online Parallel Quests, which act as supplemental scenes to the main narrative. Here, you might battle next to Frieza and his henchmen instead of the actual good guys or search for the Dragon Balls on planet Namek. Dozens of these mission open up over time, and they can be tackled alongside basic CPUs, recruited NPCs that cost money to employ, or online players that often provide a great deal more assistance than a mindless ally. These quests, coupled with additional jobs handed out by named characters in the overworld, provide longevity and act as a great way to train for the difficult end game.', ""There's local multiplayer as well as an online arena, but the combat just isn't strong enough to stand on its own. It's fun to test your unique characters against the competition, and two-man duels are substantially more entertaining than the dizzying melees found within the story and side missions. But without a narrative backbone, the basic fighting doesn't maintain attention for more than a few rounds. Additionally, I've experienced consistent issues connecting online, at times preventing me from finding opponents and even kicking me out of the overworld itself."", ""Structurally, this is the most interesting and involved Dragon Ball game in years. The new spin on tired stories provides enough intrigue to keep you playing through even the most tiresome moments, and the enhancements you can make to your created character keep you completing missions well after the natural narrative conclusion. It's rich in content, but the shallow battle system and unnecessarily bloated health bars of some foes make this feel more like a hesitant step in the right direction than a true home run for the franchise. Dragon Ball Xenoverse isn't a good fighting game, but it does have enough interesting supplementary features to make it a consideration.""]"Britton Peele,9-Mar-15,OlliOlli2: Welcome to Olliwood Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/olliolli2-review/1900-6416050/,8,PlayStation Vita & PS4,"['You push off to get some extra speed.

Imagine a cross between the Tony Hawk games' tricks and the sidescrolling action of Canabalt, and you'll have some idea of what OlliOlli2 is like in motion. You automatically skate to the right of the screen and are unable to stop or go backward. As soon as you crash, your run is over, meaning that you're always weighing the risk of longer combos with the reward of a higher score."", 'The majority of your actions are performed with the left analog stick. When on the ground, tilting or rotating the stick in any direction essentially ""readies"" a trick. Let go of the stick, and you\'ll leap into the air and perform said trick. Grinding works the same way, with you moving the stick in any direction to perform different grinds on applicable surfaces.', 'Pulling off even complex tricks in OlliOlli isn\'t usually too difficult; it\'s landing that\'s the problem. To land, you have to hit the X button right before you hit the ground, otherwise you\'ll get a ""sloppy"" landing at best, greatly reducing any points you may have been trying to earn. Grinding requires similar timing, and the highest scores will go to those who can chain together jumps and grinds before pulling it all together with a perfect landing.', ""Imagine a cross between the Tony Hawk games' tricks and the sidescrolling action of Canabalt, and you'll have some idea of what OlliOlli is like in motion."", ""The biggest additions to the skateboarding action in OlliOlli2 are manuals, reverts, and revert manuals. Pulling these moves off requires even more concentration when it comes to landing, but doing so allows you to keep a combo going even when there are no grind-able surfaces in reach. This places a bigger emphasis on completing stages in one uninterrupted combo in OlliOlli2 than in the previous game, which is rarely easy but immensely satisfying when you finally pull it off. They're small additions on the surface, but manuals and reverts add a lot of depth to the experience, allowing you to transform a run from a bunch of little combos to one long, fluid performance."", ""OlliOlli2 takes you to more exotic locations than the first game (like the wild west and an Aztec temple), but its structure is exactly the same. Simply completing a level without crashing can be tricky in and of itself, but eventually, you'll want to focus on each stage's challenges. There are five in each level, and while many of them are basic point goals or item collection tasks, others will test your abilities by asking you to chain specific tricks together or forcing you to make every manual, grind, and landing perfect."", 'There\'s a particular headspace, a certain rhythm you have to get in to succeed in OlliOlli. When you\'re there, the action is blissful. When you\'ve nailed the timing and are performing perfect grinds and manuals through even the most complex environments, the chase for higher and higher scores is addictive. Levels are short, making it really easy to say, ""I\'ll just do one more of these,"" over and over again.', ""But there are also frustrations to be had, especially when you're not in that groove. It can be infuriating to struggle with a section at the very end of a level, forcing you to replay the earlier parts over and over again. There are also a few (fortunately not many) instances where level memorization is more useful than quick reflexes, which strikes me as antithetical to the rest of the experience. Being able to restart a level at the tap of a button helps alleviate these problems, but these issues can still hamper the enjoyment."", 'The biggest additions to the skateboarding action in OlliOlli2 are manuals, reverts, and revert manuals.', 'Even with its new tricks, it\'s hard to look at OlliOlli2 as not just ""more OlliOlli."" If you weren\'t into the action the first time around, or if youve already had your fill of it, there is nothing here to win you over. One of the few features that could help differentiate the sequel, local multiplayer, isn\'t in the game at launch (but will be patched in later), and, slight graphical improvements aside, you might be able to watch over someone\'s shoulder and not be sure whether they\'re playing OlliOlli2 or its predecessor.', 'If you missed the first game, though, this is the better of the two, and the tutorial will ease you into what its 2D skateboarding is all about. And if you loved it the first time around, ""more OlliOlli"" shouldn\'t sound like a bad thing.

At its best, Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Tipping Stars understands this, forcing you to create elaborate and dynamic Rube Goldberg machines to achieve victory. Unfortunately, it takes far too long for the most devilish puzzles to rear their heads."", ""Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Tipping Stars is equal parts Lemmings and World of Goo. The main campaign consists of six worlds of eight levels in which the goal is to guide mindless wind-up Marios (and assorted Mario universe crew members) through a gauntlet of spike pits, Shy Guys, Donkey Kongs, and fire-breathing piranha plants by placing player-crafted paths and machinery at the door(s) at the end of each level while also picking up each coin and token for maximum points at the level's end.

One of the key complications of any map is that, barring levels where each figure has its own separate door, all the characters must enter the final door within a short timeframe of each other. Once a character is awakened, it only travels in a single direction--turning around if it hits a wall--and if characters are spaced out around the entire map and facing opposing directions, it's as much of a challenge to get them facing the same way and close to one another as it is to collect all the coins and reach the level's door."", ""Each world introduces a new fundamental mechanic. The first zone is the simplest, and allows you to drag red girder beams to make walls, ramps, and paths. You'll likely get the gold trophy--calculated by how quickly you can finish the level--on your first try for most of the early levels. Each world then brings in something new without abandoning the tricks of earlier worlds, until you're forced to think about how to use this path to most effectively utilize the lift so you can get the highest bounce off the jump pad. It's a shame, then, that it isn't until World 5 that any of the puzzles have the slightest amount of bite."", ""You'll likely get the gold trophy--calculated by how quickly you can finish the level--on your first try for most of the early levels."", ""If you want a game to test your children's spatial logic and reasoning skills, Tipping Stars might be a good choice, though the complex later puzzles can prove frustrating. But in 2015, there are too many, more challenging options for adults looking to have their brains stretched for Tipping Stars to feel like a worthy investment. Once you do reach the more challenging puzzles, they are wicked. The main campaign is short--it takes less than four hours to complete--but there are 24 bonus levels in the game, and, right out of the gate, they not only stretch your problem-solving skills to their limits, they continue to introduce new mechanics to the game, including magnetized walkways. But there's too much of a time investment before the game reveals its real potential. Tipping Stars does offer you the tools to create your own levels so the most dedicated puzzle fans could rise to the challenge and create their own complex worlds for players to explore, although its hard to gauge what that community is going to accomplish at this time."", ""Between its lackluster introductions and almost total lack of context for why you're doing anything in the game, Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Tipping Stars feels more like a particularly robust tech demo than a proper full-release. As a cross-buy title, it can be played on both the Wii U and the 3DS, but since you only use the Wii U Gamepad while playing, there's little reason to play it on anything other than the 3DS if you own both. If you have the patience to stick around for the game's true challenges, Tipping Stars is worth an inspection, but you have to slog through a lot of tedium to get there.""]"Kevin VanOrd,5-Mar-15,Lords of the Fallen Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/lords-of-the-fallen-ancient-labyrinth-review/1900-6416047/,3,Xbox One & PS4 & PC,"[""Lords of the Fallen cannot escape Dark Souls' shadow, but its weighty combat and impossibly chunky art style still give it an identity of its own. Yet the shadow still looms, and in the case of Lords of the Fallen's newest add-on, Ancient Labyrinth, it wholly swallows its imitator. That Ancient Labyrinth is so short is not, in itself, a fundamental flaw. That it is devoid of imagination and betrays the exploratory wonder of the main game, however, is unforgivable. This tiny, throwaway slice of action is a rude return to a world with far better stories to tell."", 'The eight-dollar asking price may sound reasonable, but it is important to understand what you are getting: a skimpy maze that amounts to three hallways, a few levers to pull, some skeletal archers, and a few other cronies to defeat. A difficult boss battle puts the cap on this miniature adventure, which includes about 30 minutes of content and a finale that stretches that half-hour into a masochistic stretch of trial-and-error bashing and blocking that could substantially extend your play time, depending on how quickly you learn The Keeper\'s tricks, and how flawlessly you execute your attacks. The skimpy gameplay leading to that battle is so forgettable as to be barely worth detailing: A secretive stranger--that Lords of the Fallen storytelling staple--sends you into the maze of monsters, hoping that you might defeat The Keeper hidden within and thus free him of his torment. Calling the three, tight, same-ish corridors you traipse through a ""labyrinth"" is laughable, sadly, as would calling the ensuing lever-pulling ""puzzles."" Your greatest challenge within the gothic stone halls is the collection of creatures that patrol them: Ghostly warriors, translucent wizards, and those pesky undead archers pester you on your lever quest, and you apply the same blocking-rolling-swinging-spellcasting techniques to off them as you do elsewhere in Lords of the Fallen.', ""You might have expected a grander journey, not simply because Lords of the Fallen itself provided one, but because the first glimpse of the labyrinth from the staircase leading there is so dramatic. Slabs of rock hover over the menacing maze, and ribbons of flame and lightning warn you of the danger waiting within. Pulling a lever causes the maze's circular walls to rotate and reveal entrances, which produces a satisfying sound of grinding and a conclusive thud. There's little fault to find in the presentation, presuming you take to this particularly exaggerated art style, in which every surface and every piece of armor is covered with sharp edges and intricate carving. Draw too near, and some part of your anatomy would surely be punctured."", ""Alas, the first boss is the only boss, and a troublesome one at that. Like The Worshiper from the main game, The Keeper employs an instakill area-of-effect attack that requires speed and care to avoid. Determining how to survive the explosion is your first task; actually performing the required tactics is the other. If you have built player-character Harkyn for bulk and not for speed, you may have a tough time of it, though there is a magical trick you can pull off to ease your troubles. The boss has four stages, the third of which breaks the rules the battle previously established regarding how and when the explosive attack occurs--a deviation likely to result in a torrent of profane language. The fourth stage, on the other hand, is easily exploited with particular types of magic, like Ram. It's an unrewarding gameplay arc for a boss fight, ending with the easiest form, rather than building the challenge to a proper climax."", 'And then your task is complete. A shield of your choice is the reward, along with a few other odds and ends, and you may then return to the monastery, or wherever else you might have been exploring. ""Is that it?"" you may ask , though not just because the add-on is so short. No--that reaction is born of what a droplet of nothing this long-awaited return to Lords of the Fallen is. It is a miniscule stroll, made to feel longer by gating its ending behind tedious lever-pulling and a trial-and-error boss battle. With Ancient Labyrinth, Lords of the Fallen doesn\'t just fail to take a step forward: It takes a momentous leap backwards.']"Cameron Woolsey,4-Mar-15,Q*bert: Rebooted Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/q-bert-rebooted-review/1900-6416046/,3,PS4,"[""Poor Q*bert deserves a return to glory. One of the first gaming icons born of the 1980s arcade boom, the sprightly (if somewhat profane) orange orb with legs and a comically large nose has spent many years out of the spotlight. Unfortunately, Q*bert: Rebooted will not swing him back toward acclaim. The game would have been merely a shallow, imperfect straight-from-mobile port, but the lousy controls, inconsistent graphics and animation, and exhausting tedium do more to damage Q*bert's reputation than anything the march of time could have possibly achieved."", 'Swapping cubes for hexagonal shapes, Q*bert: Rebooted allows for some variety of movement, made painful thanks to horrid controls. With the hexagons, Q*bert allows you to traverse beyond the classic diagonal steps for both horizontal and vertical progression across a 3D board. But the controls are incredibly slippery, which makes it difficult to judge if holding right on the analogue stick will move you right or right-up or even right-down.', ' ', 'That is, if you\'re able to move in the attempted direction at all. In far too many cases, the game moved in the complete opposite direction to which I held the analogue stick. This issue, combined with the already squirrely controls, resulted in many needless deaths as Q*bert leapt onto nearby enemies or off into the surrounding abyss. The controls also make it impossible to move using the DualShock\'s directional pad, as you must press the required directional buttons at exactly the same time or the game will only read the first input. It is feasible to get somewhat used to moving with the analogue stick over time. But even after hours of play, I still found myself accidently sending old Q*bert off into the void, eating lives, and causing me to shout far more colorful things than ""@!#?@!""', ""Q*bert: Rebooted still follows the classic formula with some changes, though the design shows its age, even more so now that it is blended with tired mobile-game trappings. Completing levels is just the same as ever. As Q*bert, you start from the top of a small handful of boards ranging from a large pyramid to a rectangle. Hopping on the hexagons changes their color, and completion comes once every platform's color has been altered. Levels are broken up into three stages (which changes up enemy placement) and capped off by a bonus round where you collect gems. The premise, however, while nostalgic, hasn't matured all too well. It's fairly straightforward, and after spending several hours hopping around the same stages and dodging the same enemies, things begin to taper off into boredom. It also doesn't help that the game requires you to complete objectives and earn stars in order to unlock a gate barring off the next group of levels, not unlike in mobile games such as Candy Crush Saga. Completing a level awards you with one star, but to earn two of the available three you must also finish a time trial and play it once more to collect a fixed amount of points. There are only five stage designs dispersed among 40 levels. And to complete the game, you will need to replay the same stages dozens of times to unlock more levels that also look the same. There is no attempt at variety; it just gets so tiring."", ""Lousy controls, inconsistent graphics and animation, and exhausting tedium do more to damage Q*bert's reputation than anything the march of time could have possibly achieved."", ""Q*bert: Rebooted comes with some extra content, but not a whole lot. The game includes Q*bert classic, if you're pining for a trip down memory lane, or if you're curious to gaze upon the 30-plus-year-old relic. But again, those controls, those awful controls, swiftly prevent you from enjoying the game for long. It's especially bad since Q*bert classic only allows for diagonal controls, and it's usually up in the air whether or not the game will read the correct inputs--in fact, it's even worse in some ways. Gems collected in the Rebooted portion of the game can be exchanged for skins. These are strictly aesthetic changes, so don't expect the Q*zard skin to bring any needed magic to the fold. You can also unlock Q*nicorn, who leaves a trailing rainbow in his wake, or the Terminator-inspired Q*1000. Just note that some of the skins come with their own special audio, so you may want to choose your skin with care. The Q*1000, for example, sounds like slapping pieces of metal at every hop, while Q*knight is more akin to the sound of someone kicking a metal trashcan down a long flight of tall stairs."", ""Not surprisingly, the game has other issues. Most levels are not all that challenging to complete, yet there is the occasional difficulty spike that pops up from nowhere just to make sure you're still paying attention. Some graphics, such as words, are heavily pixelated, and there is one starry background that doesn't quite stretch all the way across a wide screen. All of the above stand as constant reminders to Rebooted's origin as a mobile game. The animation for Q*bert is surprisingly smooth, however, but that degree of care isn't shared among his enemies. Coily the snake is easily the worst, as his barely passable animation makes it hard to tell if he's getting ready to jump or just wiggle a bit. Levels near the end of the game also get incredibly difficult, especially thanks to one new enemy, Uppercut, a giant boxing glove that bops you away if you get too close. The problem was that I could never figure out what direction it would send me, though most of the time it just knocked me out of the level. One such level finally took too much, and after nearly 20 attempts, I gave up. I was done. Oh, have I mentioned the music? It's bad. And it loops. I ended up muting the game after a few hours."", 'Not every great video game icon should get a reboot, but I feel that Q*bert is one of few who has earned a second chance. So a game like Q*bert: Rebooted, which takes a tepid approach to the need to take risks in order to refresh a classic formula, saddens me. Even if the game featured stable controls, the overall package is still mediocre at best. But with the bad controls, compounded by lackadaisical graphics and boring gameplay, Q*bert: Rebooted never had the potential to shine anyway. Q*bert, old friend, you deserve better.', ' ']"Justin Clark,3-Mar-15,Oreshika: Tainted Bloodlines Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/oreshika-tainted-bloodlines-review/1900-6416045/,8,PlayStation Vita,"[""We're currently in a place with the Playstation Vita where every great game that arrives brings an air of sadness equal to its joys. Each artistic success is a reminder of how much of a portable paradise the system can be with even the most basic amount of love and attention. In the case of Oreshika: Tainted Bloodlines, we get to see the traditional turn-based role-playing game get a serious injection of innovation that fewer and fewer developers are attempting to bring in favor of desolate open worlds and unworthy side missions."", ""The core of Oreshika is a traditional one. Four characters wait their turn to attack a horde of enemies by unleashing simple attacks, performing magic, or defending. A summon mechanic opens up later on. Much of your time is spent grinding through a relatively small number of dungeons, fighting many of the same enemies over and over, and bringing the spoils back home to divvy among your playable characters but offering bonuses based on certain conditions. In combat, it's a fine example of its genre, all things considered. But Oreshika brings a new mechanic to the table that makes the game its own compelling beast."", ""The story is this: It's medieval Japan in the time when the gods controlled every aspect of life. When six holy artifacts go missing, the gods' powers go a little haywire, and natural disasters start tearing the country apart. The emperor, under the advisement of his right hand, a sorcerer named Seimei, decides that the only way to appease the gods into sparing Japan is a massive human sacrifice: the complete decimation of a clan. Your clan. It mostly works, aside from the occasional wild storm or plague, but the gods most certainly don't approve of Seimei's methods, so they decide to pull themselves together and intervene. The gods resurrect your clan and set them on the course to gain enough power to exact some good old-fashioned revenge on Seimei."", ""There's one major problem, however: Seimei's human sacrifice left the clan stricken with the Curse of Broken Lineage, which means that the newly resurrected clan members can only live for two years, and they cannot reproduce with other full-blooded humans. The gods are at least willing to help there. In exchange for enough of their devotion (earned by slaying demons), members of the clan are allowed to mate with a god/goddess of their choosing to produce offspring who grow at an accelerated rate. It doesn't rid the clan of the curse--the offspring have two years to live, as well--but it allows your family to carry on your work, as well as bringing a whole host of supernatural powers and traits into the bloodline."", ""And so your clan's quest for revenge begins. After going through an extensive character creator, in which you make a family name, select a few common hereditary physical features, and pick classes for an initial generation of three siblings (fencer, martial artist, or gunner), you spend most of your early time with Oreshika running your clan every month through beautifully rendered labyrinths based on Japanese art, myths, and legends. In addition, you slaughter the demons who live therein, leveling up clan members as much as possible, grabbing as much loot as you can, and making them powerful enough to kill the labyrinth's bosses for massive amounts of power and glory. Once a year, in every area, an event called the Feast of All Demons takes place. During this event, the demon world is accessible from a portal deep in a specific labyrinth, and you have a shot at taking out Seimei, though he's always too strong and often just sends a giant monster to play with you while he laughs the laugh of the criminally insane."", ""Beating the beast allows you to grab one of the lost artifacts. Losing, or not being able to find the demon portal before a member of your family gets too old/sick to fight, means waiting and training another year to make another attempt. And unfortunately, time is quite literally of the essence, especially in the labyrinths, where it moves on Inception rules (one month = around 10 minutes, with the clock slowing but not stopping while you're in fights). Thankfully, the gods grant you a helper, a weasel who can morph into a bouncy, happy, anime girl at will, who makes up for her grating anime-ness by being a ridiculously useful personal assistant who keeps you on task for the month. She automatically buys new armor and weapons if you let her, organizing your items, telling you everything that happened last month/will be happening in the next, and essentially operating as a quick reference guide for any of the game's mechanics you still don't grasp. There are at least a bakers dozen of games that could use such a character, just minus the weasel outfit."", ""If the game was just this, it'd be a fine, fun, slightly more self-serious twist on the Half-Minute Hero formula with the most striking use of the traditional ukiyo-e art style since Okami, and we'd leave it at that. The combat is a little on the easy side if you spend the time to level up early enough. Furthermore, most of the time it doesn't take much to start steamrolling the majority of what you'll encounter, but the gimmick of extensive battles taking time and effort that you may not be able to afford is a strong one to base a game around. There's even a unique set of difficulty options that can either make it so that leveling up is much slower, meaning that enemies are more difficult for a longer time, or, for folks who dont have time to kill or want to perform dungeon speed runs, can make every encounter worth several times as much XP, but you only get five minutes inside the dungeon. From the pure-blooded RPG side, you can customize just how much of a time suck you want the game to be."", ""In addition, the game's loot system is a risk/reward proposition, in which you get more experience if you kill everyone on the field, but only killing the enemy leader gives you the loot, and the leader can take off at any time. Getting the game's best items versus leveling your characters is a constant conundrum, and it keeps things interesting throughout. The most egregious issue is that while you get a mini-map in the lower right corner, there's no full-on map to pull up of each labyrinth. This means that there is a lot of wandering around, particularly in twisty dungeons, and that you will be wasting time you don't have because you can't remember what room the portal to the Feast was. Luckily, combat is fun enough where the aimlessness is only an issue when you're trying to reach the Feast, and by then, hopefully, you've been in that labyrinth often enough to take notes and directions."", ""But Oreshika has deeper ambitions in mind than just being a slick dungeon crawler. More than anything, Oreshika is a better-than-advertised family simulator. The survival of your family's collective knowledge and power is dependent on your ability to breed carefully, to select heads of the family who will command respect, to make sure that each family member is treated fairly and feels useful (e.g., listening to their suggested actions in battle), and to keep everyone healthy and alive as long as humanly possible. There's an almost overwhelming number of stats to watch, measuring everything from a family member's vigor (i.e., how much of their stats they actually have access to, which lowers the older/more frail they get) to their loyalty, and all of them carry elemental/emotional values that affect that family member's actions. Family members that carry higher earth or water affinity in their stats tend to follow orders, fight smarter, and pick up on skills a lot more easily. Fire and air affinities tend to be powerful, but their loyalty stat tends to drop a lot more quickly, they demand attention much more, and they are most often the ones who run away from home when they hit maturity--taking a bunch of your family's wealth with them--if they feel they're not being used properly, listened to in battle, or respected. The game's primary focus isn't just to make yourself a higher level than the bosses; instead, the focus is to raise children who valiantly carry on their parents' work if they're not."", ""Ensuring the continuation of the bloodline means choosing a god to mate with from the pantheon. There are dozens and dozens of elaborately designed gods to choose from, all with their own genetic makeup, physical traits, elemental affinities, and personalities. Again, the sheer amount of information to take into account is daunting, and it is not really laid out in a way that's easy to read. With practice, however, it gets easier to breed the changes you want into your family, even if you don't ultimately like every consequence. Just like in real life, traits can skip generations, and a mom's or dad's genes could become more dominant or recessive than the other. The son of an expert archer might sometimes end up with terrible aim. Marrying a demure-looking dancer to a fierce warrior god could result in a high-stat badass daughter. Sometimes, well, you just plain end up with ugly kids, but even then, a dumb, clumsy child who's not learning the family trade fast enough can be trained by his or her parent (rendering her unusable in dungeons that month) for a massive jump in stats. There's a staggering number of stats, affinities, and personalities to be found, and so far, I've yet to run into a combination, even among siblings and direct descendants, that cloned someone I'd seen before, even while keeping so much other info from their ancestors."", ""Perhaps the most fun, useful, and contextually powerful mechanic in the game, however, is the heirloom system. Putting enough money into a weapons shop allows you to invite a craftsman to your town who can make heirloom weapons and armor made that can be passed down generation to generation as long as the family member carries on the name of the one who commissioned it. The initial piece is typically one of the lowest-stat items in the game. However, every time it's held by a descendant and the descendant levels up, the item's stats go up with it. After being passed down a few generations, in the case of, say, a sword, the owner may learn a new skill. Even more surprising, any time that descendant is up against a much stronger enemy or your party is outnumbered, the spirit of one of his or her ancestors may show up on the field to imbue the weapon's next action with a spectacular new power--just when you need it most. Even when the list of available classes opens up even further, the game rewards keeping the family business alive, and it inspires loyalty in the player--if not to specific people, then to the name and the item he or she passes on."", ""Throughout Oreshika, that quote from Kill Bill about revenge not being a straight line but a forest you get lost in came to mind. After a few generations, my family in Oreshika had already become as large and diverse as any real family I'd ever witnessed. Kids would run off and start families in other areas; daughters of other clans would marry into mine. Dark-skinned cousins would become invaluable experts in guncraft who worshipped a stern-faced, strong-willed, fiery bull god and strictly come to destroy bosses. The sudden passing of the head of the family ahead of their 24-month expectancy would feel like a genuine loss, and the family's status in other lands would suffer for it."", ""Though Oreshika isn't the first to try and make an old-school RPG feel new or to make customizable characters feel like a family affair--Fire Emblem: Awakening tried something similar on a smaller scale, for example--it does feel like the first to completely bet the farm on that idea and succeed. You're compelled to take inexperienced children through an old dungeon to get them learning new skills. You're compelled to spite disloyal teenagers by letting them leave, casting them out, or marrying them off. You're compelled to have a dying mother train her child before the curse takes its toll. And when you're strong enough, you're compelled to take a family into the fray and lay waste to your enemies like no generation had prior. The Vita isn't dead yet. Turn-based RPGs aren't dead yet. Oreshika makes the strongest argument in a long time that developers should be taking advantage of those two facts.""]"Peter Brown,3-Mar-15,Resident Evil: Revelations 2 Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-revelations-2-episode-two-review/1900-6416043/,6,Xbox One,"[""Resident Evil: Revelations 2 sets you down the same path at two different points in time, playing as iconic characters Barry Burton and Claire Redfield. In the first episode, Claire is stuck on an island that's under the control of a devious overseer, who subjected her and her companion, Barry's daughter Moira, to a veritable gauntlet of violent and deformed monstrosities as they tried to make their escape. Barry arrived six months later, hoping to rescue his daughter, and when he landed ashore, he befriended a mysterious girl named Natalia who can see enemies through walls, making her a very useful companion indeed. Even though you ran through the same locations twice, once as each party, different weapons, enemy types and companion abilities were enough to stave off repetitiveness, even if the latter wasn't always used creatively at all times."", ""Episode One ended with a compelling cliffhanger that introduced a pivotal plot point, and while it's not surprising that it doesn't come full circle by the time Episode 2 ends, it would have been nice to have a little more narrative to chew on as you near the halfway mark in the overall story. In total, there's very little new information revealed until Episode 2's own cliffhanger, which reinvigorates your interest in the events at hand, but also leaves you in the dark, with unanswered questions luring you back for Episode Three."", ""At least the action picks up some of the slack. Claire and Moira kick off the latest episode in a rundown village, where they encounter a pair of other people from TerraSave, Claire and Moira's employer. Unfortunately, the new characters you meet offer more poorly-written and -acted dialogue, much like Moira did in Episode One, but at least she's less abrasive this time around. With their help, you attempt to eradicate the once-active logging village of its afflicted vermin, an act that ends with you in a cabin as enemies burst through windows on every side. It's one of two peaks during Claire and Moira's chapter that gets your adrenaline flowing."", ""After escaping the village, you emerge in a rundown city, with derelict busses and violent dogs patrolling rusty playgrounds. In the middle, a tower stands tall. It juts from the city's foundation, dominating the skyline, and on top, a pulsing, ominous red light beckons you to enter. The number of stories between the ground level and the top inspires fear; you're a long way from the top, and it can only get worse as you close in on the den of your manipulator."", ""Revelations' puzzles, if you can really call them that, are standard fare. The challenge is often survival during the act of resolving the roadblock, rather than the process of coming up with the solution."", ""As you move through its halls, puzzles with switches and doors stand in your way, per usual, but after Episode One, you know the drill at this point. Revelations' puzzles, if you can really call them that, are standard fare. The challenge is often survival during the act of resolving the roadblock, rather than the process of coming up with the solution."", ""This is most evident when playing as Barry and Natalia, when the game introduces invisible monsters that only Natalia can see. They appear to her as orange or red clouds, depending on how close they are, but Barry sees nothing except screen-wide waves of luminance and color that disrupt his, and your, vision. Simply skirting past these enemies isn't an option; you die the moment you make physical contact with one. To overcome them, you have to use Natalia to figure out the general location of the enemy, and you have to switch to Barry to kill them, which is easier said than done when you're firing blind. The interplay of their two skills is valuable here, but it also comes across as forced, standing between you and the rest of the game."", ""Natalia and Barry must separate in order to make it past a door that stays open for a limited amount of time, for instance, with one person manning the switch while the other physically prevents the door from closing. You initially clear the area while fighting side by side, going through the motions of looking through Natalia's eyes and then Barry's to take down invisible monsters. Once the coast is clear, you both go your separate ways for a moment, but you ultimately need to reunite when another invisible monster appears between Barry and Natalia. Natalia can't sneak past it or defeat it; she can only see it. Barry must come to the rescue, but with each character on a different side of the monster, you practically have to triangulate its position as you fire blindly. The fact that it's invisible and will always kill you in one hit makes the experience frustrating, as you have to redo the previous steps of killing the other invisible monsters and fixing the door before you get to try that part again."", ""Where Barry and Natalia stole the show during the last episode, the best moments of Episode Two come from Claire's side of the story, because Barry and Natalia don't really accomplish a lot this time around. Other than the aforementioned cabin scene, the boss that Claire and Moira fight after entering the tower is one of episode two's other highlights. He's a large, cannon-wielding foe, and he's also got a team watching his back. Go big or go home: this battle is easiest won by fighting fire with fire. Fire bombs and other expendables may or may not have been useful to you in tense situations before, but you better pray that you have enough left here, because without them, it's going to be a long and arduous fight. Part of what makes this exciting is that you are probably fighting on your last legs, ammo-wise, but the boss itself is also smarter and more threatening than other enemies you've fought so far, and you have to be proactive rather than reactive to come out on top. It's a great conclusion to Claire's time in the spotlight, but it leaves a lot for Barry's story to live up to."", ""Sadly, it doesn't, and it's disappointing to see that, once again, only one half of this week's episode is praise-worthy. Claire and Moira face tense situations, and when you come upon a new environment, you're seeing it for the first time, but once you take control of Barry, you're essentially going through the motions in the same environments that Claire did until you encounter the invisible enemies, which are more frustrating than anything else. The concept of an invisible enemy is interesting, but the fact that it also kills you in one hit makes its purpose so transparent that you loathe it, rather than appreciate the opportunity it presents. Were it not for Claire's chapter, it wouldn't be hard to sit out the rest of Resident Evil: Revelations 2, but the memory of the good times, and the latest cliffhanger, ultimately stick with you when the credits roll.""]"Cameron Woolsey,3-Mar-15,Helldivers Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/helldivers-review/1900-6416044/,8,PS4,"['Helldivers won\'t be remembered for its narrative, nor will it be praised for intriguing mission design. No, these elements of the game are merely average pieces of a backdrop in a theater enacting thrilling performances destined to be endlessly retold among friends and fellow helldivers--and many of those tales are the kind that begin with ""Hey, do you remember that one time?"" Among these stories, the best ones told by veteran helldivers are of the edge-of-your-seat moments that culminate in cries of jubilance and relief as you and your allies watch your space-faring drop ship fly to safety just in the nick of time. But just as indelible are the tales that end with howls of disappointment (or, sometimes, laughter) as the last remaining member of the team crumbles against the odds and is finally overtaken. There are undoubtedly some blemishes in Helldivers\' armor, but inside that armor you\'ll find a story creator, helping you craft fond memories to be retold for years to come.', 'Indeed, the stories you create will be ones that will stick with you long after you hang up your uniform, as the plot in Helldivers is one quickly lost to the recesses of space.

You fight an interstellar war against three other races: the grotesque bugs; the technologically advanced illuminate, and the cyborgs, humans who grafted flesh to metal after separating from the regime--all of whom the government has decreed the enemies of freedom for some reason or other.', 'The game draws its theme from current history and popular fiction such as Starship Troopers, with the latter inspiring the game\'s light-hearted, corny propaganda. There are also some thinly veiled references to real-world issues. The Super Earth government labels cyborgs, who reportedly attack with suicide bombers, as terrorists, all the while justifying war in the name of protecting democracy and ""our way of life,"" as well as collecting necessary resources such as, you guessed it, oil deposits (sometimes the veil is so thin as to be nonexistent). But Helldivers isn\'t attempting to be the next Spec Ops: The Line. It uses tongue-in-cheek humor throughout, and a delicate touch with its weighty themes.', ""Helldivers is tug of war on a cosmic scale. You and your fellow helldivers fight together against the three computer-controlled species, who reciprocate by pushing toward Super Earth. It's a persistent online universe, in which battles are won and lost even if you don't partake in them. The war theater, viewed from a console on the deck of your ship, is split into three large sections that are then broken into smaller sectors, any of which are claimable after you gather enough community points. These points are earned by completing missions on the many procedurally created planets nestled within. Once all the smaller sectors are claimed, you can begin the real battle, on the alien homeworld. During my time with the game, we were able to take the fight to the bug planet, which invoked some fond memories of a certain sci-fi adventure romp. Hopes were high, but to say the planet was a tough nut to crack would be an understatement--we got completely whupped. The desert world was too much for our handful of helldivers, but perhaps the story will be different post launch. Ultimately, complete conquest of the three planets is the goal, and once achieved, the game starts anew. The home world fights are not the only special events, however. On occasion, helldivers are called to safeguard a city under siege, and cleansing the infestation results in a double dose of experience points. Also, if an enemy species manages to breach Super Earth's defenses, all players rally to its defense."", ""The humdrum missions, sadly, do put a damper on the engaging design of Helldivers' war front. Planets are won by completing objectives, which don't stretch far beyond the typical, such as capturing and holding an area, activating some device or another, or the always popular escort mission. Odds are you will be too occupied dealing with oncoming waves of enemies to notice boredom seeping in, but after hours of slowly dragging a briefcase or yet another hapless group of stranded civilians across a stretch of terrain, it's difficult not to feel a sense of slowly mounting frustration at the tedium. Completing missions offers a variety of awards, at least. Experience points, in an amount that varies depending on your performance, are showered upon you at the end of each stage. Leveling up unlocks new weapons and gear to be used in your campaign, though I would have preferred for the game to denote which piece of equipment unlocks at what level, rather than being occasionally surprised."", ""Helldivers' one-two punch of deep strategy complementing intense cooperative combat, however, is fantastic. It is so good, in fact, that it often overshadows much of the dreariness arising from the dull missions. It is incredibly satisfying to play on a team of up to four helldivers, all relying on each other to survive while executing carefully planned strategies involving perks and equipment. Playing the game solo is possible and provides its own set of challenges, but it just doesn't offer the same experience. Choosing a planet, the squad leader picks where the group of guerilla fighters will make its landing. On the ground, the team then decides what pieces of equipment, called stratagems, to call down, and what objectives to tackle first. Equipment varies, and includes options ranging from a UAV, which pinpoints threats on the map, to gun turrets, ammunition boxes, heavy guns, and much more. New stratagems are unlocked when battles on certain planets are completed, with more equipment being offered as a reward. The enemies you face also affect your game plan: Bugs are plated in thick carapace, and charge at you brandishing massive claws; cyborgs are often strapped in bullet-deflecting armor, forcing you to carefully line your shots up with any exposed fleshy bits; and the illuminate attack with high-tech war machines, mind control, and snipers that can kill with one hit."", 'The stories you create will be ones that will stick with you long after you hang up your uniform, as the plot in Helldivers is one quickly lost to the recesses of space.', ""The combat itself unfolds organically as you make your way from objective to objective. If your landing is free of immediate hostiles, you can attempt to move through the area with stealth and haste, quickly eliminating any scouting party before scouts manage to raise an alarm. It's entirely possible to complete a mission leaving only the corpses of unwitting foes in your wake, but more often than not, you will end up hammering down your trigger as enraged forces rush to meet you. The weapons, which include a disparate array of rifles, shotguns, and beam cannons, dish out white-hot metal or plasma in gratifying thunder. Bullets rip through flesh, leaving smatterings of blood and piles of viscera in their wake. Effortlessly smooth controls make the gunplay feel terrific throughout every fight."", ""Helldivers is easy to jump into, depending on your familiarity with twin-stick shooters, but even if you're used to the style, you will find that the game has many factors for you to keep in mind the moment your boots touch terra firma. Chief among them is the immense difficulty, which requires all players to be at the height of their game, as one mistake can spell immediate disaster. As you travel around, research samples that dot maps must be collected in order to earn points to use to upgrade weapons and stratagems. Friendly fire is another item of concern, as it is always on and cannot be disabled, so practice keen trigger discipline. Ammo conservation is an equally high priority, as reloading will discard any unused rounds in a clip."", ""Death is no stranger in Helldivers, and despite your glorious, flowing cape, you are not superhuman. The game demands a sharp eye and a clever wit; otherwise, you will go down fast. And, take it from someone who knows, if your fallback procedure keeps circling back to running away as quickly as possible, then maybe it's time to rethink the battle plan. Falling in combat is hardly the end of the game, however, as you can call down a reinforcement stratagem to bring a lost comrade back onto the battlefield. But do keep an eye on where the pod (actually, any stratagem, come to think of it) is about to land. Far too many helldivers have lost their lives being crushed beneath incoming ordnance, which doesn't solve any problems whatsoever."", ""Beyond mission design and story, Helldivers has other issues, though some are negligible. For example, you can customize the look of your helldiver, as well as unlock new clothing designs as you go along, but the options only change from dark to not-so-dark. Since the camera floats off at a distance, it's easy to confuse one dark-armored soldier with another, often resulting in someone foolishly falling off a ledge or firing a weapon into an unrecognized ally. A friend I was playing with also mentioned that the game wasn't tracking his progress when he was playing in my lobby. This is a minor issue; one that I've been informed may be patched by the time the game releases. On the more nitpicky side: What is with the wind on some planets? More than once, during rare moments of silence, I watched as shadows of clouds moved northwest, while dust on the ground flowed to the west, and a small handful of particles lazily floated east. All the while my cape drooped, apathetic to the elements. But on the subject of capes, it's oddly amusing to spin in place and watch your cape flow in response to the motion. And I know I'm not the only one to feel this way. Before nearly every mission, I watched as so-called hardened fighters twirled on the deck of a battleship; joining the impromptu dances is almost irresistible."", ""The game draws its theme from current history and popular fiction such as Starship Troopers, with the latter inspiring the game's light-hearted, corny propaganda."", ""Helldivers is a hugely entertaining space romp, despite bearing a few battle scars. It is truly a game designed for precious water cooler moments, when you can tell stories of fights barely won, and anecdotes detailing white-knuckle flights from insatiable hordes. The deafening cheers heard through my microphone as the last living member of the team squashed a bug tank with three reinforcement pods, turning the tide back toward victory, is forever etched in my mind. Imperfect as it may be, Helldivers' focus on the cooperation of a small team looking out for each other against oppressive waves of enemies elevates it from what would have been a fun and challenging shooter, to a game that now sits at the top of my list of how I plan to spend many future evenings: with a gun in hand, my allies at my back, and a broad smile on my face.""]"Kevin VanOrd,2-Mar-15,ScreamRide Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/screamride-review/1900-6416042/,7,Xbox One,"[""As fun as it is, there's something rather...disturbing...about Screamride. A game about racing rollercoaster cars down rails at tremendous speeds and smashing them into concrete skyscrapers isn't to be taken seriously, of course, and I'm not terribly concerned about the riders, who seem beyond thrilled for the chance to sacrifice their well-being for the chance to fling themselves into solid objects. My worry lies with the pedestrians walking around out there. There are promenades to stroll on among the office buildings and laboratories. What right-minded individual would think to hang out there--or to work there?"", ""Well. This isn't the kind of thing you're supposed to be thinking when you play Screamride, which sets itself apart from the developer's own Rollercoaster Tycoon series in this regard. In the RCT series, a crash was always a tragedy; Screamride's thrill-seekers hoot and holler on their way towards collisions like the Duke boys sliding across the hood of the General Lee, and the rocktronica soundtrack doesn't miss a beat, even when the riders' ragdoll bodies thump against asphalt. They must enjoy it. So do I, actually, though your enjoyment depends on your willingness to cast aside memories of Rollercoaster Tycoon and its freedoms in favor of Screamride's hyper-happy attitude and unique mix of construction and destruction."", ' ', ""Add racing to that mix, too, if you want a fuller picture. Screamride is split into four discrete chunks: racing, demolition, engineering, and sandbox creation, locking creation tools behind gates that can only be opened by participating in career events. That's not the worst thing in the world--Little Big Planet manages to make the idea work, after all--but if coaster creation is your primary draw, busywork is mandatory. There are other limits that also stifle creative minds bursting with ideas, but forget about them for a moment. Instead, picture a roller coaster that gives its riders a modicum of control over speed and balance--coaster cars with brakes and accelerators, and with limited boosting capabilities, that let you lean into curves so you don't go flying from the tracks as you whip around corners."", 'Experiencing a coaster this way is called screamriding, and it closely resembles traditional racing, apart from the obvious limitation of being glued to the track, with the exception of jumps, or in circumstances when the race purposefully ends with a coaster train launching from the track and into a high-rise. You are an active participant, earning boost by pressing a button just as you near the end of a blue stretch of track, and using an analog stick to nudge the car left or right, either to keep the car on the track, or to navigate the twists the game throws in, such as monorails that require you to lean on two wheels. Of course, most of the twists are in the coaster design themselves. No real-life coaster would risk such barf-inducing curlicues, but in the Screamride fantasy, why not throw caution to the wind? The rider-view camera angles might inspire some waves of nausea for you, but I never felt like upchucking. Then again, I seem to be immune from coaster sickness in real life, too.', ""Your enjoyment depends on your willingness to cast aside memories of Rollercoaster Tycoon and its freedoms in favor of Screamride's aggressive xtreme attitude and unique mix of construction and destruction."", 'Real life coasters rarely allow you to reach speeds of 150 miles per hour, unless you\'re a regular at Ferrari World in Abu Dhabi. Early on, when navigation isn\'t so tricky, it\'s easy to enjoy the thrills; as the campaign progresses, you\'re more concerned with spotting where blue tracks ends so you can earn a spot of boost, and with avoiding spills that could cost you time. At advanced stages, Screamride isn\'t about the joys of riding roller coasters: It\'s about gaining as many points as you can and showing off your skills on the game\'s online leaderboards. The game\'s insistence on turning everything into a competition is its defining negative feature, actually. ""Sorry if you want to just ride the coaster and enjoy it!"" says Screamride. ""Roller coasters aren\'t fun enough on their own."" Screamriding comes with its own kind of thrills, at least; finishing the Sky-Scraping Serpent challenge without a derailment rewards you not just with points, but by allowing you to sigh with relief after several minutes of white-knuckle track navigation.', ""Screamride's biggest gameplay triumph is only tangentially related to coasters. The game is big on destruction. It wants you to see colossal buildings collapse into voxelized heaps, and even showcases a few debacles outside of demolition levels. (You can even fly your car into towers should you launch from the track during a race.) Being a demolition expert is the game's strongest allure. On a fundamental level, demolition challenges are akin to a 3D version of Angry Birds: You launch a cabin from a rotating arm into arrangements of structures in the hope of causing a cavalcade of destruction and gaining points for it. (2007's Pain for the PlayStation 3 also springs to mind as an apt comparison.) Explosive barrels are tucked away in strategic places, and spires are placed to maximize damage if you bump them in just the right way."", ""Demolition is based on physics, so even a seemingly perfect launch may not have the effect you desired. Luckily, Screamride avoids Angry Birds' aggravations, focusing more on the demolition than on unreasonable challenges. Later levels add all sorts of accoutrements to the mix: cabins that divide or bounce, trampolines and magnets that extend your cabin's usefulness, and so forth. Other levels launch coaster cars off of a track and let you steer them directly into structures. Whatever the specific wrecking ball you use, razing a level is wholly satisfying. Monoliths topple onto other monoliths like a set of massive dominoes, and firing a cabin into the spindly legs of a colossal robot causes it to collapse upon itself in a glorious implosion of rubble. You can always restart the level with the press of a button should you miss your target; doing so causes demolished structures to be rebuilt as you watch, a process that might have been almost as amusing as the demolition if it didn't cause the frame rate to hit rock bottom. (Generally, the frame rate is not Screamride's strong suit.)"", 'You get your build on in Screamride\'s engineering challenges. The sandbox aside, these levels best hark to the spirit of Frontier\'s previous creations, plopping a coaster down on some terrain, and asking you to complete it using a specific set of standards. ""Complete the coaster with a minimum drop height of 100 meters, a minimum travel length of 950 meters, a top speed of 93 mph minimum, and using at least three special pieces"" is one such goal, though others are much simpler (""Launch a rider""). There are some engineering control quirks to contend with, mostly to do with navigating between disconnected tracks, but the interface is otherwise commendable, and it\'s easy to test your coaster as you progress, and then return to construction, where you can add and twist tracks to your heart\'s content.', ""The interface's usability is at its most apparent when you delve into Screamride's sandbox, which is overflowing with ways to build coasters and environments, whether you intend for those environments to provide atmosphere, or whether you intend to annihilate them. Make your own structures using cubes of concrete, glass, iron, and stone. Craft the island that your challenge rests upon with tiles of grass and metal. Delve into blueprints, where you can find pre-fashioned constructs that help automate the parts you aren't interested and focus on the parts you care about. Screamride asks a lot of a controller, given all the baubles and doodads, but clear tooltips make the process as simple as you could ask for."", ""There are complications that arise: all of this creation is in the service of a screamriding, demolition, or engineering challenge, so if you want to share your accomplishment, you must adjust vital parameters. That means setting goals, establishing any limits on coaster parts like loops and corkscrews, bonus challenges, and so forth. If you apply yourself, however, the results can be marvelous. As I write this, Screamride has not been released to the public, but press members and Frontier's developers have crafted some excellent stuff, like my favorite of the screamriding challenges, The Vaporizer, which flies along at speeds surpassing 170 miles per hour, and offers no hope of figuring which way is up and which is down until the challenge had ended. Thanks, SirTokeAlot85! Too bad I can't see how I fared against other racers on your level--or on any user-created levels."", 'The game is big on destruction. It wants you to see colossal buildings collapse into voxelized heaps.', 'The sandbox\'s downfall is not in the breadth of its toolset, but in the limitations on how you use it. Screamride suffers from a pressing need to give everything you do the same structure as its career challenges. You cannot simply build a coaster, ride it, and share it for others to do the same--not directly. Well, you can build an engineering challenge and ride your creation by testing it during and after construction, and then remove a couple of pieces of track and create a lame challenge out of it for others to complete and test. Or, you can save your coaster as a blueprint, which other players can use in their own level, which requires building a level, placing your coaster, and testing it. Or, others can download your challenge and then edit and test the coaster. But these are convoluted ways of circumventing Screamride\'s ""Roller coasters aren\'t fun enough on their own!"" outlook. It\'s frustrating to have so many tools, and so few ways of putting them to use, like an overwhelming pile of Legos that you can only use for making a boat, a car, or a house. Future downloadable content allowing for straightforward sharing, riding (not screamriding), and viewing coasters in action would be as surprising as a pile of vomit at Busch Gardens Tampa\'s Montu exit.', 'I don\'t wish to further belabor the issue of ""what Screamride doesn\'t do,"" however, because ""what Screamride does do"" is a more interesting subject. It turns roller coaster riding into a self-destructive blood sport in which you demolish buildings and ruin little computer people\'s lives for the inherent joy of it. Building up and tearing down is an age-old pleasure, and seeing sky-high structures fall like dominoes with a flick of a stick is Screamride\'s primary delight. I sometimes think of all those digital men and women that went plummeting to their dooms, but at least they died doing what they loved.']"Leif Johnson,27-Feb-15,Oblitus Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/oblitus-review/1900-6416040/,8,PC,"['Parvus, from the Latin for ""little,"" is such an apt name for the hero of Oblitus. He spends his waking hours tossing sticks at beasties the size of small buildings, and his jaunts take him among household items such as pots and jars that are so comically oversized he might as well be walking through a Claes Oldenburg exhibit. It\'s possible, too, to read a bit of self-deprecation on the part of one-man development team Connor Ullmann, who\'s been saying for two years now that his little 2D sidescrolling rogue owes heavy debts to Dark Souls. Parvus\' journey is fraught with failures, restarts, and seemingly insurmountable challenges. Thus, his journey echoes the creative trials of a developer who knows he has massive boots to fill.', 'Generally, Oblitus succeeds, in spirit if not in presentation. The influence of Dark Souls doesn\'t beat you over the head as it did in last year\'s Lords of the Fallen; instead, it reveals itself in subtler ways, such as how the reason behind our masked hero\'s existence reveals itself chiefly through gameplay rather than storytelling. You see it when poor Parvus can\'t sustain more than a few blows before the words ""You Have Died"" fill the screen and reset your progress, or how darkness and shadows cover so much of Parvus\' world. It\'s a beautiful world, and while Oblitus opts for an attractive hand-painted aesthetic that evokes a gritty reboot of Castle Crashers, it\'s possible to catch echoes of Blighttown and Darkroot Garden reverberating throughout its interiors and forested paths.', ""The nods to Souls carry over to the combat, with the key difference that this is a fast-paced game that better resembles Mega Man or more contemporary platformers like Outland. It's intuitive stuff, for the most part, and a quick prompt when the game first boots up bidding you to mirror the action keys for either a gamepad or keyboard serves as all the tutorial you need. There's a sense, though, that Ullmann tried too zealously to Souls-ify his game. Parvus can parry and block with his shield by activating the left bumper and trigger of a gamepad, for instance, but the option never feels anywhere as useful as his ability to roll through most adversaries, swatting them with his trusty wooden spear before rolling swiftly to the other side."", ""Small collision issues complicate the matter because it's not always clear if our little warrior can block an attack at a particular angle or even if his jabs will hit. Parvus is thus much more effective when fighting on the move, jumping Mario-style over lumbering bog monsters and lizard men rather than staring them down behind a shield or using the option to throw Parvus' spear across the map (and suffering a slight respawn delay for the privilege). Oblitus' very design tends to confirm this bias, as the combat upgrades Parvus picks up focus far more on options such as gaining invincibility while rolling and jumping higher than on employing our little hero's rickety shield."", ""In less capable hands, such challenges might be overcome by simply memorizing where Oblitus' monsters enter and exit, and recalling precisely when to make various jumps. But this is Oblitus, a name that means forgotten. Ullmann's game escapes such predictability through the roguelike elements of its gameplay, which shakes up the locations and types of upgrades, health renewal boosts, and even a few of the enemies after each death to ensure that each playthrough differs from another. Even the map itself isn't entirely safe, as elements such as corridors and platforms sometimes subtly extend to make room for more foes. The upshot is that each of Parvus' forays into his strange world is fraught with an exciting urgency that's absent in 2D games relying on extra lives and self-sacrifice for the sake of experimentation. When you risk losing everything, Oblitus says, everything starts to count."", ""That's a lot of abuse to hurl at players, particularly when it also means that some playthroughs will inevitably be easier than others. However, Oblitus keeps it manageable with zones that feel just large enough to deliver a satisfying sense of exploration while remaining compact enough to keep replays worthwhile. (There's even an achievement for beating the game within 25 minutes.) Elsewhere, enemies deaths reward you with a near-imperceptible bit of replenished health. The handful of bosses, while massive enough to take up huge chunks of the screen, usually require simple (although sometimes not immediately obvious) strategies that assuage the pain of repetition in the case of almost certain failure. It's like the kid on the playground who's just mean enough to start scuffles with you but is never quite unbearable enough to drive you away. Indeed, my main complaint throughout had little to do with the moment-to-moment gameplay but rather with the way the world is filled with too many surfaces that look like they should be walkable but aren't."", ' ', ""Ullmann does his game a bit of a disservice by so vocally trumpeting the influence of Dark Souls; this is something different and attractively brutal, although its component elements are familiar enough to make it accessible to almost everyone. (And if the considerable appeal of Volgarr the Viking proves anything, it's that publisher Adult Swim has a soft spot for punishing platformers.)"", ""But there's plenty of pleasure in this pain, and it reveals itself in not only the richly imagined bosses and enemies but also Josh Whelchel's haunting soundtrack, which fares just as well off the screen as it does when Parvus is busy stabbing creatures of the dark. If you're up for some pretty punishment, Oblitus provides an experience that you won't soon forget.""]"Justin Clark,27-Feb-15,Republique Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/republique-review/1900-6416041/,8,PC,"['It begins with a plea for help, a closeup of a teenage girl\'s panicked face, clandestinely whispering about being ""erased."" Her name is Hope. You don\'t know why she\'s called you. You can\'t quite tell where she is. But you know she\'s frightened, and everything is horribly wrong.', 'We know this not because some omniscient narrator fills us in on the world in Republique\'s opening in-engine scene but in the same way you get all your information in Republique, a way that few games offer: you observe. You explore. The truth about Hope\'s new surroundings is out there, on the walls, in the newspapers, in the voicemails scattered around the game. Either the future or we\'re at least in a place with the future\'s technology. A foreboding ""headmaster"" sees all, assuring an unseen populace that all is still right with the world. Except clearly it isn\'t since you\'re surrounded by guards, people are smacking our girl around, blathering on about manifestos, the dangers of information, and the poisonous influence of a dead rebel named Daniel Zager, who sets the tone at the game\'s outset during the developer logos even more succinctly and ominously with a single quote: ""I used to be angry at my government because I thought they weren\'t listening. Now I\'m angry because I know they are."" We are in a world of lavish accommodations, a place that resembles Xavier\'s School for the Gifted more than any sort of prison, and yet all the other telltale signs of a stone-cold prison are inescapable and in full view.', ""And so begins Republique, with a sense of supreme disquiet and a constant, ongoing bewilderment. It's that bewilderment that drives the game onward and keeps you guessing episode after episode through a mystery that's all too reluctant to hand out easy answers."", ""The dystopian nightmare is a compelling veneer for a rather simple stealth game when it comes down to brass tacks, though. Once you break Hope out of her initial confinement cell, your task is simply to keep her out of the hands of the Prizrak, the private security stooges milling about, keeping Pre-Cals--that is, the children of Republique--in their place, locked up, and under control. You do this by hijacking the thousands of surveillance devices scattered around the place, Watch Dogs style, and guide Hope from hiding place to hiding place, just beyond the sight of the Prizrak, hacking every piece of electronic equipment you can find, occasionally managing to improve your door access in the process. Republique's lineage shows here. Developer Camouflaj has a few Metal Gear Solid veterans working under its roof, and that game's stealth pedigree shows in the patrol patterns, Hope's hiding spots, and the more advanced reactions when the Prizrak spot Hope and give chase. The difference is that Hope doesn't have Snake's arsenal--or anything much at all, really. Hope can pick up pepper spray, tasers, and a landmine that puts the Prizrak to sleep. She can even pickpocket them from the Prisrak if she's clever. But for every item Hope picks up to just barely fend off being caught, the Prizrak get taser-proof armor and nerve gas. It's in character for the game at least since Hope is definitely shown to be a naive character who wouldn't know anything about the subtle arts of murder and persuasion. But it means often feeling like Hope is hideously outnumbered and outgunned."", ""I used to be angry at my government because I thought they weren't listening. Now I'm angry because I know they are."", ""Or at least it would if getting caught meant death or punishment or higher security. Instead, losing means being marched, hands up, to the nearest confinement cell (these are, essentially, the game's save rooms), waiting for the guard to leave so you can bust Hope out. For a place that seemingly wants Hope dead and has no problem putting the boots to anyone who disobeys, they seem to handle Hope the way you would a bratty four-year-old, and it works every time. It doesn't make the stealthing around any less fun, and arguably, the infinite retries are often a blessing, considering the amount of Metroid-ish backtracking that you already have to do, but it does mess with the game's immersion."", 'Indeed, breaking the hypnotic, curious spell that the game can cast when its doling out more of the mystery is its biggest problem. When jumping from camera to camera, you have the ability to read detailed files on each of the guards, which would be a nifty touch, one that pays off in spades in the third episode, if not for the fact that most of the guards\' files have a giant ""Kickstarter backer"" stamp under their country\'s flag and often reference their gamer identities. Early on, you start getting additional assistance from another Prizrak guard who calls and offers advice and information in emojis and a Stephen Hawking voice. He\'s a strong character, whose role in the facility is pieced together bit by bit and who just so happens to have floppy disks referencing fellow indie developers scattered all around the place as collectables. The game certainly has supporters in high places who deserve tips of the hat, but placing those smirking nods so shortly after Hope sees her first dead body or after watching Republique\'s media branch destroy a man\'s reputation feels wholly out of place.', ""It's only a stumbling block considering how great a job the game does of world-building for such extended periods. For most of Republique, our eyes and ears are just as innocent as Hope's, and every new room is ripe with opportunities to learn something new, to find a new piece of the puzzle of what we know about the Headmaster's plans and ambitions, the rampant, terrifying censorship and moralizing, the journalism-turned-propaganda-machine, the failed, or the hostile attempts by the Republique brass to engage the leaders of the free world. The stellar voice cast keeps us engaged from minute one, with every hackable device giving us brief, audio-only glimpses of the outside world and Republique's black-hat inner workings."", ""At the center of it all, literally and metaphorically, there's just Hope, a frightened girl who just wants to see the world outside Republique, and we can already tell that she is in for some hard times if she ever does. Episode 3 drops a few major bombs as to who and what Hope might be, and it's worrisome stuff that threatens to absolutely ruin a girl we're already forced to tread lightly with. One of the only moral choices in the game involves that very idea of how much of the world's worst lies on her shoulders. Where Republique's gameplay is satisfyingly simple, the plot driving it on is anything but."", 'The dystopian nightmare is a compelling veneer for a rather simple stealth game.', ""Needless to say, despite its mobile game roots, the world of Republique is meant to immerse, to beckon the your curiosity, and to involve you enough in the city-state's ins and outs to get Hope, our frightened girl, out of danger. The good news is that, in transitioning to PC, the game remains largely successful. All that remains is for the game's two remaining episodes to stick what is undoubtedly going to be a rough landing for everyone involved.""]"Kevin VanOrd,26-Feb-15,Hand of Fate Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hand-of-fate-review/1900-6416038/,7,Xbox One,"[""Hand of Fate may not be a Dungeons & Dragons game, but it captures the imagination in a similar way: by abstracting exploration and encouraging your mind to create exactly what the forests, dungeons, and villages you encounter might look like. The game's mysterious and melodramatic card dealer takes the role of dungeon master, uncovering cards that represent star-crossed lovers looking for a friendly face, or raging riverbeds that must be crossed. Meanwhile, you sit across from the enigma holding the cards, choosing whether to help the lovers, or to alert their parents; you navigate that river, hoping to traverse it unscathed, rather than to draw the ire of nearby lizardpeople. You never see these lovers: they exist only as a few words and a card. Hand of Fate invites you to look beyond its abstractions and picture such moments with your mind's eye. When the game tells you of a surreal circus that dissipates on the wind once you make your exit, the writing is just clear enough to let you paint within the outlines drawn for you."", ""It's tempting to call Hand of Fate a cross between a collectible card game and an action role-playing game, and while you can customize your deck, that comparison doesn't seem quite right. A typical CCG is competitive, having players attack and counter using cards that represent creatures, heroes, statistics, and so forth. In Hand of Fate, those cards act in tandem as a tabletop game board in which you move your token one square at a time, uncovering events with each turn. The enigmatic dealer places his cards face down in a linear or non-linear arrangement, and with each move, you lose a single ration of food, which is one of three primary resources--along with gold and health--that you must track. That card might represent a simple bandit ambush, a bard asking for coin in return for a song, or a magic portal that takes you to the next adventuring area--which means navigating a new arrangement of cards."", 'Drawing a card often leads to more choices, many of which are determined solely by luck. You are running from a giant tentacled behemoth, and your destiny belongs to the whims of four cards, only one of which represents success, while the others represent various degrees of failure. The four cards are shuffled, and with a shaky hand, you choose the one you hope leads to safety. Some events are stacked in your favor--the hand may consist of three success cards and one failure card, for example--while others punish you with several randomized draws in a row, each of which possesses only a single chance of success. Victory often means drawing from a stack of equipment cards from your own deck (Ooh, look: a flaming sword!). Failure, on the other hand, usually means drawing loss cards that diminish your maximum health, or even curse you with negative effects that last until the game is over--unless, that is, you draw a card for a mage that sells curse removals, and you actually have the 75 gold necessary to buy his services.', 'Encounter cards lead you into battles that are not left to your imagination, but occur in real time. Combat ushers you into a small map within a forest, or within a ruined temple, and you swing your axe or sword at rats and mages until they fall--or until you do. Skirmishes have a Batman: Arkham vibe, in the sense that prompts appear over your head, and you must press the proper button to counter a melee attack, or to deflect an incoming projectile. Early battles are easy enough to survive, but as the story mode wears on, you face difficult situations made even more challenging by bear traps hidden in bushes, and giant golems that pound the ground, forcing you to tumble away lest you lose a giant chunk of health.', ""Hand of Fate's brilliance lies in how its abstract components inform very real battles. Should you run out of food, for instance, each turn slashes ten health points away from your total supply. If you are nearing death when the next battle begins, you are all that more anxious about timing your swings perfectly, and avoiding traps at all costs, knowing that being hit by a single dart is enough to change the tide of battle. Back and forth you move, from battle arenas to the cards in front of you. When you draw near death during battle, you return to the cards hoping the next move might bring you nearer a priest who might heal you, rather than draw a curse that siphons away your last remaining spirit. When you leave the cards for battle, you wish you hadn't sold shield for the food you were so desperate for. Tensions rise as the pendulum swings back and forth, and all you can do is pray the hand of fate provides cards that favor and bless you. It's a satisfying tug of war, unusual in the way it marries the conceptual with the physical."", ""It is in the details that Hand of Fate suffers, occasionally allowing the frustrations to outweigh the fun. On the battlefield, the small maps and fixed camera don't play nice, too often limiting your point of view when you most need situational awareness. I often longed for breathing room, such as when close to a dozen rats swarmed me on a sea vessel so small that neither I nor my enemies could properly move about. And I often wished for a better camera, particularly during the occasional trap mazes, when I couldn't quite tell if a map square was trapped because a wall was in my way, and the camera had yet to pull closer. Off the battlefield, the element of chance also proves vexing. What is an adventurer to do when a series of curses has reduced your maximum health pool to one point of health before you have ever entered battle? You might play several story matches over and over again, pining for triumph, only to throw the controller and move on to something less cruel, like Spelunky or Dark Souls."", 'Technical troubles hinder the game in and out of combat. The frame rate in particular is habitually unstable; the single-digit jitters that typically occur when the dealer performs his mystical shuffles may not affect gameplay, but it certainly diminishes the magic of the moment. I also encountered numerous bugs; there was a period during which I had to start up the game multiple times before it would run, and another stretch during which the lava golem would immediately die when he performed his first attack, as if he was taking damage from his own wallops. (Note that I have only played on the Xbox One; these problems may or may not occur on PlayStation 4 or PC.)', 'Yet Hand of Fate has a way of drawing you back into its fold, even after you have completed its story and have taken to Endless Mode, which challenges you to stay alive as long as you can before your luck runs out. The game absorbs you in three ways at once, by invoking both the loot-gathering vibe of an action RPG, the deck-fiddling fun of a CCG, and the ""I\'m feeling lucky this time!"" aspirations of games of chance. It\'s a powerful one-two-three punch, though you need to be prepared: sometimes those punches land with unexpected pain.', ' ']"Peter Brown,24-Feb-15,Resident Evil: Revelations 2 Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-revelations-2-episode-one-review/1900-6416037/,7,Xbox One,"[""The premiere episode of Resident Evil: Revelations 2 kicks things off in a decent way, but it's also an inconsistent experience that's plagued by issues during the first half of the game. Dialogue is poorly written, and you feel like a chump when you tackle yet another fetch quest disguised as a puzzle. However, there are moments that leave you on edge, and the mysteries keep piling up until the very end, stoking your curiosity to want to know more. If you tend to loathe action sequences in Resident Evil games, you may be put off to know there are a few in Revelations 2, but rest assured they're delivered with tact this time, sandwiched between foreboding moments of tension that set your pulse racing before you're thrown into the fray."", ""Though Revelations 2 starts with a whimper, at least it doesn't waste any time getting you into the game. Right as they were starting to enjoy a swanky company party, Resident Evil hall-of-famer Claire Redfield, and her co-worker, young Moira Burton, are kidnapped at gunpoint and shipped off to a wretched penal colony on a remote island. The game begins when Claire awakens in a damp cell, and the mystery kicks off when the door opens moments later, seemingly on its own. Their imprisonment is clearly the work of someone who fancies control as they're taunted over the PA system by a mysterious overseer. She speaks in very vague terms, introducing more questions than answers. By and large, Revelations 2 likes to keep you guessing."", ""Moira's father, the ever memorable Barry Burton from the original Resident Evil, attempts to come to Moira and Claire's rescue. With the help of a young companion, the mysterious Natalia, he searches the same prison, but the enemies he faces are quite different, acting more like classic zombies as they shuffle along, rather than the speedy juggernauts that hunt Claire and Moira. This setup affords you two points of view within the same nightmare, and slightly different gameplay experiences, but not all things are created equal. Barry's act is far stronger than Claire's, not only because it offers the best moments of tension, but because his companion is a far better compliment than Moira ever is to Claire."", ""Working in tandem is at the heart of everything you do in Revelations 2, for better and for worse. You can switch between your two characters on the fly, and sometimes you must in order to solve simple environmental puzzles. Moira's flashlight may uncover a hidden item that you need to proceed, and Natalia can go places that Barry can't thanks to her small stature."", ""Unfortunately for Claire, Moira's not much use outside of a few strict scenarios that call upon her unique abilities. She looks capable of manning a gun, but a tragic event from her past conveniently prevents her from doing so here. She comes in handy when she pries open a rare door or blinds an occasional enemy, but she's otherwise dead weight and a near constant source of bad dialog as she spouts vulgarity after vulgarity. It's not hard to take in because it's offensive; it's obvious that she's meant to sound young and brash. However, she comes off as an exaggerated caricature that sticks out like a sore thumb."", ""Outside of a few important plot points, the only helpful thing Moira brings to the table is a flashlight, but Natalia has a subtle personality that comes across as a breath of fresh air and she's far more useful during tense situations. She can sneak by enemies undetected and crawl into tight spaces. If Barry is low on health, Natalia is a solid backup, trading head-on action for simple but effective stealth. Though she lacks the firepower, Natalia proves to be even more useful than her caretaker at times, so long as she remains undetected by the bad guys."", ""Natalia and Barry's stint is the best source of tension in the game by a long shot. For the most part, Claire and Moira are stuck inside their prison, which is predictable and boring. On the contrary, Barry and Natalia spend a lot of time outside, and in the middle of the night, with only a few light sources off in the distance, a sense of dread creeps in when you wander into the unknown. Natalia is the best candidate for the job given her ability to spot enemies from a distance, but you always know in the back of your mind that she's practically incapable of defending herself apart from throwing a brick at an enemy, yet there you are, meters deep into a dark forest teeming with horrific abominations that want nothing more than to eat you alive. When an enemy takes multiple rounds from a gun to stagger, a brick offers little solace."", ""You can tackle the campaign via local co-op with a friend if you're so inclined, but your teammate has to come to terms with the fact that they're playing second fiddle. Teaming up is an effective means of getting through the campaign quickly because you aren't reliant on AI to watch your back, and you have the ability to multitask, but the split screen view and real world chatter can dilute the tension. If you're looking to get scared, playing solo is the only way to go."", ""There are a few puzzles to solve during each scenario that are reminiscent of classic Resident Evil moments, but instead of having to consider all of your options and search for a solution, it's given to you in the form of a simple task. Ultimately, these moments feel like chores rather than puzzle solving opportunities. Moira's asked to point a flashlight around a room to find a key, for example, testing your patience rather than your intellect. If anything, these quandaries feel like justifications for having a sidekick. Perhaps it's good that it's not as obtuse as some games in the series' past, but the formula has been simplified too much for its own good."", ""If you find your trigger finger itching after beating the first episode, you can hop into the optional and oddly enjoyable raid mode. This arcade-like experience pits you against small armies of enemies in various environments from this and future episodes, and you're encouraged to take advantage of your firepower. The more enemies you kill and the more efficient you are at doing so, the better rewards you receive, often in the form of additional weapons. It's a very different experience than the main game, especially with it's initially jarring dance soundtrack, but it's a fun diversion that gives you plenty to do once the rather short campaign comes to an end."", 'Though you have to wade through mediocre puzzles and endure cringe-worthy dialogue and references to past games, episode one successfully entices you to look forward to the next episode. Just before you feel like its antics are wearing you down, it commands your attention by redeeming itself during the second half, just before sealing the deal with an impactful cliffhanger. With tastes of both classic and modern Resident Evil, Revelations 2 has something for everyone, but it would be served better if it was a little more focused and had a little less Moira.', ' ']"Kevin VanOrd,23-Feb-15,Aaru's Awakening Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/aaru-s-awakening-review/1900-6416036/,4,PC,"[""Some say that there is no such thing as love at first sight--that initial attraction and infatuation appeal only to our aesthetic pleasures, and that true love only rises when passion no longer clouds our judgment. Romantics and idealists may dismiss the notion, but the deep-rooted frustrations of Aaru's Awakening may drive them to reconsider their sentiment. This unusual game craves your affection, each of its radiant hand-drawn environments singing love songs until you're entranced. You may initially fall for this superficial beauty, but the game soon reveals its true form as a vindictive suitor, grossly untrustworthy in its controls and devoid of the fundamental assets of any good platformer. I am sorry, Aaru's Awakening, but I must cut this relationship short, and I am afraid it's not me: it's you."", ""I offer no insight into Aaru Awakening's actual development process, but it's easy to assume that visuals were prized over all other elements. Even the hub from which you access the game's levels is ravishing. It exquisitely represents the passage of time from dawn to night, each quadrant of a central orb depicting an abstract landscape that looks drawn by colored pencil. Within the side-scrolling stages, cross-hatching and asymmetrical markings provide texture and depth, while moving elements like lava floes and falling rocks are drawn frame by frame. It is through these techniques that Aaru's world comes to life underneath its unnatural magenta skies."", ' ', ""The playable hero is Dawn's champion Aaru, a bearlike creature with a mane that stretches from head to tail, and he, too, moves with a charming hand-drawn inelegance that befits his illustrated world. Alas, the gracelessness of movement that makes Aaru initially joyous to watch in action becomes the game's most prominent failing. When a platformer requires finesse and quick response, as Aaru's Awakening frequently does, fluid animations and controls are vital. Aaru is anything but fluid, however, changing positions mid-air with all the precision of a sloth that has been dropped from a fourth-floor window. Aaru would be a delightful hero in a meandering adventure, but Super Meat Boy he is most certainly not."", ""As if to make up for his lack of leaping prowess, Aaru can rush ahead in a single whoosh, and can also propel an orb from his body that he can teleport to--and it is around these two mechanics that most of Aaru's Awakening's maddening puzzles are formulated. Navigating the game's spaces is a trial in and of itself, due to a wholesale absence of genre basics--the kind of basics we take for granted in the best platformers because of their ubiquity and necessity. We expect to be able to quickly identify what objects are collidable and which are background art, for instance, particularly when we need to make snap mid-air decisions. Here, the foreground and background blend with the gameplay layer. Is that branch sticking outwards a platform, or just a visual detail? Will I pass in front of that barrier, or will I collide? That Aaru's Awakening requires you to even ask such a question rather than for you to immediately know is a colossal problem."", ""Without the fundamentals in place, any cleverness apparent in Aaru's Awakening's platforming challenges dissipate. What the challenges may even be is often a secret until you are dropping from a great height when the platform beneath you crumbles, or when a ramp has propelled you forward. You may not be able to tell whether you will fall to safety, or impale yourself on a bed of spiked rocks, until gravity makes the decision for you and the spikes rise into view, too late for you to do anything but succumb to death. Now you know for the next time--but when you bear the burden of this game's inconsistent movement and clumsy animations, it's difficult to build enthusiasm for a next time. And that's an issue: Aaru's Awakening is, by design, a trial-and-error platformer in which you shave off as many seconds from your completion time as possible. Your reward for success is the chance to show off your skill on the game's online leaderboards. I might have enjoyed chasing the competition had the challenge been to overcome tricky puzzles and perform perilous leaps, rather than to wrestle with my controller."", ""Putting down the controller is an option, though it's natural to reach for a gamepad when playing a platformer. Aaru's Awakening's controller support is not ideal, however, assigning the default jump move to an analog stick rather than a button. You must also activate the controller in the menus before you can use it, and should you unplug it during play, the game may stop responding to any input, even if you plug the controller back in. Regardless of your control method, the maddening levels may drive you to smash your hardware. The Dusk boss fight, for instance, requires that you rush across a series of platforms, some of which crumble, and some of which drop and then rise towards the spiked ceiling. You must teleport into the globes that float in this stage as well as avoid the poisonous river that waits for you at the bottom of the screen. Aaru's awkwardness turns what might have been an exciting sequence into a mess, during which you must perfectly execute your dashes and perfectly aim your teleport orbs at the proper angle within unimaginably narrow time gaps. There's no fun in the trying, and thus no fun in the succeeding."", ""Yet Aaru's Awakening hints at fun. You fire your teleport orb past a beam of scorching light, teleport again by angling your orb into a thin, winding passage, and an arcing ramp flings you into the sky. What a rush this moment is--a rush then halted when you land in the pool of lava that didn't appear until you were six inches above it. You destroy a hideous colossal housefly by teleporting inside of it--what a fantastic idea!--only to drown moments later because you must blindly teleport, not knowing what you might find until you've closed the deal. Aaru's Awakening is a dreamy display of artistic imagination that yanks you back to waking life with every awkward leap and every ill-conceived level."", ' ']"Austin Walker,19-Feb-15,Grow Home Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/grow-home-review/1900-6416034/,8,PC,"['Grow Home took me by surprise--not least because it was announced only a few weeks ago. Grow Home, that announcement said, started as an internal experiment, and stars a charming little robot named BUD, who has to wobble and climb his way up a giant beanstalk and across a series of floating islands. With only this scrap of information, I went into Grow Home not knowing what to think. I came out with several distinctly different, hard to synthesize impressions.', 'To assess Grow Home in a vacuum is to trip over the compliments that spill forth. The game\'s colorful island, cute creatures, and the planet\'s ambient sounds are immediately charming. You explore this world as BUD, a robot on a quest to retrieve seeds for a plant that can re-oxygenate his home world. To do this, BUD climbs the giant ""Star Plant"" stalk, occasionally taking control of its quick-growing branches and driving them head first into the glowing islands in the sky. The Star Plant sucks out the green glow, and then grows a little bigger. It\'s all very cute (and a little, uh, phallic).', 'Grow Home is a strikingly beautiful game, especially in motion. Everything hums with bright, colorful life. Through its use of cel-shading, low-polygon models, and subtle environmental animation, Grow Home builds a gorgeous, minimalistic style. And then, as the stalk and its branches sprout up through the sky, Grow Home sets that minimalism against overwhelming scale. Beauty is everywhere: You can let your sight linger on the butterflies, or you can look upwards, to the towering Star Plant reaching into the upper atmosphere. ', ""While the environments shine, BUD is the real star attraction. His bobbing head, wide smile, and eager chirps make him lovable, but it's the way he moves through the world that makes controlling him such a joy. BUD's animation is procedural: instead of having the frames of his movement handcrafted by an animator, the developers programmed a system for BUD's limbs to animate according to the player's input. You direct BUD around the world with the left analog stick, using the left and right triggers to control his hands, which can grip anything they touch."", 'As you try to deal with the quirks of BUD\'s unpredictable movement, the result, at first, is a sort of comedic flailing. This was never frustrating for me, but I can see how it might be for others. Maybe you misjudge the amount of momentum BUD will have as he lands on one of the ""branches"" of the massive stalk, and wind up flinging him thousands of feet down to his demise. Or you might think you\'ve got a firm grip on the cliff face, only to find that you\'ve actually grabbed onto a loose boulder. Whoops. You can supplement your control of BUD with some environmental tools: springy plants give you a way to boost BUD\'s jumping power, while flowers and leaves work as parachutes and hang gliders. But these often lead to other stumbles. Pro tip: if you crash into anything while floating around with that leaf, you lose hold of it and go into a headfirst dive. Whoops, again.', ""This is all reminiscent of games like Octodad and Sumotori Dreams, both of which leverage uncontrollable bodies for the sake of humor. But unlike these games, there comes a point in Grow Home where you attain a sense of control that feels both elegant and exuberant. BUD's body never becomes Ezio Auditore's--it always bounces and leans in unpredictable ways. But Grow Home isn't a game about laughing at atypical bodies. Instead, it's a game that lets you become familiar with limbs that don't quite work like your own do, and it teaches you to take joy in using tools to augment your natural abilities."", 'I invoked the name of Ezio because the second way I experienced Grow Home was in the context of Ubisoft\'s recent offerings. For Ubisoft, 2014 was a year of too safe (and often too broken) output. Watch Dogs and Assassin\'s Creed: Unity were technical disappointments, and, worse, failed to mix up the increasingly tired open-world formula common to Ubi\'s tent-pole releases. The Crew tried to apply that formula to a whole new genre, and in doing so missed a chance to do something really special. And while Far Cry 4 was well received, the common refrain was ""It\'s more Far Cry 3."" It\'s easy to imagine how Grow Home\'s vision of climbing-and-collecting might fit into the familiar open-world Ubisoft blueprint. In fact, I wouldn\'t be surprised if a version of this new climbing model eventually finds its way into an Assassin\'s Creed sequel. But Grow Home never falls into the design traps that show up in other recent Ubisoft titles. Yes, you do search for collectible crystals, but these aren\'t carelessly scattered by the hundreds across the environment. They\'re placed carefully, to encourage exploration and to challenge you to understand how BUD moves. And yes, these crystals unlock new abilities (such as a jetpack!), but these upgrades aren\'t doled out along a carefully scheduled arc to maximize your attachment to the game.', 'If you prefer the sensory overload of those aforementioned games, you might find yourself disappointed with Grow Home\'s lack of density. Sometimes you spend a few minutes plotting a course across the sky to a hovering island in the distance, only to find it empty but for a hidden crystal and a small collection of plants. Grow Home does not provide you a screen filled with side objectives and a constant stream of narrative reinforcement: It is happy to let you take your time, to meander, to move at your own pace for the few hours it takes to finish it. And while you might see its ""short"" length as a negative, it\'s Grow Home\'s brevity that lets it shine.', ""No game exists in a vacuum, and sometimes it's hard to confront the contexts that color our experiences, especially when they make us second guess ourselves. Is Grow Home a charming game that's worth your time? Yes. Do I believe this because Grow Home contrasts so sharply with Ubisoft's recent output? Also yes. Yet no matter how prone to cynicism you may be, you shouldnt let this surprising gem go unnoticed.""]"Kevin VanOrd,19-Feb-15,The Order: 1886 Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-order-1886-review/1900-6416033/,5,PS4,"['The Order: 1886 is a torturer and a tease. It promises you a circuitous story populated with near-immortal knights, it promises you exciting encounters with snarling werewolves, it promises you clever weaponry the likes of which you rarely see in video games. It dangles these hopes in front of you and then yanks them away, reneging on one promise after another, letting you hold that precious toy in your hand and then denying you the chance to maintain the thrill. The Order is cruel in the way it plays with your expectations, taking a promising premise and then sucking out much of the energy with boring cutscenes, an ending wholly devoid of closure, and shooting-gallery action sequences.', '""Boring"" is the best word to describe The Order in general, actually. That this third-person action game turns a parade of steampunk imagery and Arthurian legends into a dull stew of modern games\' most tiresome cliches is quite a feat, though hardly one worth celebrating. It is (as you probably guessed) 1886, and you are Grayson, otherwise known as Galahad, one of the Knights of the Round Table. It is a time of trouble: common citizens have begun to rebel against the gentry, possibly allying with a race of werewolves the game alternately refers to as lycans and half-breeds. It\'s a brilliant setup, ripe with possibilities. You look to the sky and see zeppelins hovering overhead; you look to the armory, and you find a young Nikola Tesla ready to introduce you to clever armaments. That such a world could be so lifeless is unfathomable.', ""Yet The Order turns the mystical into the mundane. You face lycans early on, leaping out of the way and shooting them down before killing them off for good by plunging a knife into them. And then they are cast aside for hours until the half-breeds are barely a memory. The Order pulls them out of hiding a few more times, though the circumstances are highly controlled, and conclude with the kind of anticlimax that becomes the game's calling card. The most dramatic of these few battles end with quick-time focused snoozes that betray the very idea of confronting such beasts. As for the nature of the lycans--where they come from, what their presence has meant for humanity, how humans could ally with such creatures--most of that is left to your imagination. Developer Ready at Dawn doesn't address the most interesting aspects of its own ideas."", ""Instead, the story focuses on its stale protagonists, who sit and argue at the round table every so often while getting to the bottom of the rebel plot. What a shame that interesting supernatural and social elements would be sidelined in favor of boardroom shenanigans, particularly given the light character development. I applaud the cast: the voice acting is brilliant, far better than the material deserved, and it is the acting talent alone that invested me in the characters' fates. The soundtrack, thick with cellos and violas, also rises above the blandness, but by the time the finale and its predictable quick-time events arrive, it is too late to squeeze emotion from this dry turnip. The credits roll after the button press that serves as an ending, and vital story threads are left dangling in the wind. Perhaps the Order: 1886 means to hint at a sequel, but whether or not that was Ready at Dawn's intention, it's a disrespectful end to a plodding story. This may have been a fine close to the second act of a three-act story, but it's a rude sendoff to anyone hoping for explanation or reason."", 'How bizarre, then, that The Order is so focused on its narrative. During the initial sequences, you may assume that it is more Heavy Rain than Uncharted: you respond to threats by pressing the right buttons when prompted. As it happens, The Order is divided more or less equally into four disparate pieces: cutscenes, QTEs, walking around, and shooting. In time, the game strings these features into poorly-paced sequences that have no sense of rhythm. It is the modern action game personified: This is the part where I walk for three minutes, and now comes the short bit where I have to pick a bunch of things up and look at them, and then comes the brief shooting part that practically ends before it begins.', ""Walking, looking, and shooting aren't bad on their own, of course. What makes such basic mechanics so predictable and rote in The Order is how they are used. When the game forces you to holster your weapon and walk at a snail's pace, you may expect it to build tension or to develop its characters. Instead, The Order becomes an exposition machine, dropping basic plot points until you either open the door that leads to the next ultra-linear stage of the ultra-linear level, or another character does it for you."", ""The sequences in which you examine your surroundings looking for clues are even more tedious. You trudge about a room, picking up objects and looking at them, perhaps even turning them over in your hands before setting them down. In a few instances, the game might identify a detail of interest, and you have to press a button to continue, though the overall goal is typically to pick up everything in the vicinity until you trigger the next event--and in at least one case, you aren't even the one to discover the pertinent information, making all of that monotonous strolling aggravatingly pointless. A few weapons aside, you're rarely looking at anything of interest: old photographs of characters you barely know (if at all), letters that provide the tiniest morsel of backstory, and so forth. That The Order is so in love with its own object models is almost laughable: You pick up minor knick-knacks and lovingly rotate them as if you have discovered the Holy Grail. Yes, this model ship is lovely, but was the self-congratulatory time-padder necessary?"", ""I presume that The Order: 1886 wishes to build its world by demanding you admire the details, but Ready at Dawn needn't have tried so hard to point out how pretty their art is: it is simply pretty, full stop. The game has a few of the standard tricks up its sleeve to gloss over the occasional flaws: motion blur, a subtle film grain effect, overzealous depth-of-field effects, and the such. It's difficult to overlook The Order's tonally consistent aesthetics, however: It is fully committed to its style. From a bridge's vantage point, you wield an electrically charged cannon while gazing upon a smoky Victorian London. The bridge is dotted with iron carriages, some still sturdy, and some ravaged by the ongoing firefight. Rococo flourishes adorn the Knights' chamber: walls decorated with gold leaf, floors embellished with Latin script, flickering candles embedded within serpentine sconces. The Knights' weathered faces aren't quite beautiful, but they are remarkably human; Each of the Lord Chancellor's grimaces and squints betray a soul-crushing history you wish you could have partaken in."", ""The action is almost an afterthought, given all the talking, the walking, and the quick-time events, few of which complement onscreen motion in the manner of Telltale Games' best QTEs. It's a shame that The Order evokes Heavy Rain so early in its six-hour play time, because the comparison does not work in this game's favor. The Order clearly has cinematic aspirations, regardless: The loose camera hews close behind you, to the point where you can not often see much of the battlefield once you have taken cover. The game is at its best when it allows itself to be a shooter, which is what makes its failings all the more disheartening. The thermite rifle is one of the most interesting weapons in recent memory, letting you fire a round of magnesium ammo and then ignite it with a rush of air. What a blast it is to mess with such a unique firearm--and what a heartbreaker to have such grossly limited use of it. The same is true of the previously mentioned cannon: It is ripped from your hands all too quickly and replaced with less-interesting pistols and carbine rifles."", ""Those weapons function just fine, at least. The level design is functional, too, but uninspired. You know a turkey shoot is about to begin as you enter an area and see all the obvious cover spots--and then the turkeys appear, right on schedule, ready to die at your hands. Expectedly, such predictability breeds apathy. Grenade-lobbing supersoldiers aside, it's all too easy to mow down the opposition, making the blacksight mechanic, which allows you to temporarily slow down time and pelt foes with bullets, all but unnecessary on medium difficulty. There's a system in place for recovering if you are downed in combat, but it, too, is superfluous: should you fall, a rebel soldier almost always lands a killing shot."", ""All of these gameplay tropes are then shoved together into herky-jerky levels that end just when you think they might gain momentum. The only individual sequence lengthy enough to find a rhythm is a later stealth level, though it's far too simple to inspire wishes for more sneaky sections. What, then, to make of The Order: 1886? It is, at best, perfectly playable, and lovely to look at and listen to. But it is also the face of mediocrity and missed opportunities. A bad game can make a case for itself. A boring one is harder to forgive.""]"Brett Todd,18-Feb-15,The Legend of Candlewind: Nights & Candles Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-legend-of-candlewind-nights-candles-review/1900-6416035/,2,PC,"['The Legend of Candlewind: Nights and Candles had me at ""Eye of the Beholder""--and lost me about five minutes after I finished the install process. You may be willing to try any role-playing game promising to evoke the feel of the classic D&D first-person adventures, but developer Atmosphere Entertainment Studios\' dismal and pointless exercise in nostalgia is unlikely to win your admiration. Mindless action, stupid difficulty, a needlessly convoluted interface, and filmstrip production values combine to turn off even the most forgiving player looking for a blast from the past.', 'In many ways, Legend of Candlewind is even more primitive than games like Eye of the Beholder and other late 1980s and early 1990s dungeon crawls like Dungeon Master, which sold a whole lot of Atari STs in their day. The game opens with a lengthy text blurb about the fantasy realm around the town of Candlewind and the need to venture off to ominous Blackwood Forest to deal with some rogues. So, no cutscenes or animations here, though the font looks kind of nice and Tolkien-esque, at least. From there, you get dumped right into a dungeon labyrinth (uh, what happened to that forest?) with four adventurers ready to go. This gang consists of the standard tanks up front and mages in the back. There are no options to create your own characters or do any sort of customizing.', 'I generally don\'t mind being stuck with pre-rolled heroes. Nevertheless, I have to admit to being annoyed here, if only because of ridiculous names like Garrison Hiffs and Shailee Frostflower. Even worse, all the character profile pics are of the same scraggly haired guy who looks like he might have been hauling gear for Deep Purple circa 1973. All are given minor alterations with the less-than-creative application of facial hair and a helmet, although the attempt to make the members of this gang of four look different from one another is so half-hearted that it\'s laughable. And yes, even poor Shailee gets this treatment, which leaves her looking more like a third-rate groupie hanging out with the roadies backstage than ""the daughter of a forest witch.""', ""Game mechanics are even more irritating. There are no frills here--absolutely none. The game doesn't have keyboard shortcuts, which leaves you doing everything with the mouse. There are no proper tool-tips, even for the usual items, like spells. The developers also seem to have gone out of their way to create the most cumbersome interface possible. You need to hold down the left mouse button and open up a menu just to select and move objects in your inventory. The whole system is ridiculously obtuse. It took me 10 minutes to figure out how to shoot an arrow, because you have to actually pick arrows, divide them, and then manually load one onto a bow."", 'Adventuring is boring and repetitive. All you do is trudge through the stone-walled chambers of a labyrinth, stopping only to kill the same handful of unconvincing monsters in exhausting turn-based battles. Creatures like goblins, rogues, and, uh, goblins and rogues are static models that simply blink their way closer and closer to your position. Actual combat is depicted by these models leaping up in the air, in an effect akin to somebody waving a paper cutout at you. Only single creatures are shown. Attacks by groups of goons happen, but their numbers are depicted via icons at the bottom of the screen, as they line up and go at you single file.', ""Successful attacks in Legend of Candlewind aren't shown by any sort of swinging sword, but by the enemy in question flashing red and occasionally spitting out a few drops of blood. Spells come with rudimentary pyrotechnics: I've thrown cherry bombs more impressive than the game's Fireball. The only sort-of presentation plus is the musical score, which features enough flute to sound like Jethro Tull on a bad day. That said, this score is a single looping song, and it vanishes completely after just a couple of minutes of play, never to return. Oh, and the sound effects consist of thuds and louder thuds."", 'All you do is trudge through the stone-walled chambers of a labyrinth, stopping only to kill the same handful of unconvincing monsters in exhausting turn-based battles.', ""As for combat strategizing, there isn't any. Once an enemy appears, everything gets locked down. You can't access your inventory during scraps at all, so forget about swapping weapons, taking a potion, or using some sort of magical gizmo. The lack of access to cool gear doesn't mean much, though, because the dungeon isn't exactly rich with treasure. Vanquished monsters don't leave behind loot drops. You're about as likely to walk out your front door right now and spot Bigfoot as you are to find a treasure chest in this game. Even when you do spot one, it's always stuffed with useless items like apples, loaves of bread, arrows, a rare gold coin or two, and the odd potion of healing or magic. Weapons and armor are virtually impossible to find. I spent most of the game with the same pathetic gear (the lead fighter is equipped with nothing but torches and a shield) that I received at the start of the game. These clowns come off more like wandering vagrants than the usual RPG heroes swinging swords and rocking plate mail."", 'Difficulty almost immediately soars off the charts. If you push ahead into the labyrinth, you quickly run into murderous opponents who simply cannot be slain. You can\'t rest, either. Your only option when it comes to restoring health or mana is to quaff potions or cast spells, although the former is in short supply and mana points can be quickly exhausted by throwing around just a few incantations. The only way to get anywhere is by grinding out levels, courtesy of the game\'s handy ""Wait for Monster"" button that summons up random encounters. This is as exciting as it sounds. And very slow. Just a handful of experience points are earned in each battle. Arriving at last at the second level is cause to pop some corks.', ""Doors with obvious locks are scattered throughout the dungeon. Click on them, and you get a message about the door being opened with a key. Only there aren't any keys, and most of the doors are actually unlocked. It took me an hour to figure this out, and that was only because I accidentally clicked to move forward one too many times and wound up going right through a door. Even without these fake-out doors, nothing about the dungeon seems real. Encounters with friendly characters are not shown on-screen. Wandering traders, folks who need a hand, and other characters are shown solely with text descriptions and boxes you click to select actions."", 'No matter how starved you might be for old-timey role-playing, give The Legend of Candlewind a wide berth.

In Canvas Curse, you control Kirby with only the stylus, tapping to make him roll along and drawing rainbow lines to move him up, down, over enemies, and into the path of collectibles. Kirby could also copy enemies' skills and use them to his own advantage, making for an interesting and versatile mix of abilities to guide the beloved pink character through a handful of worlds packed with environmental puzzles."", ""Canvas Curse innovated a new way to move Kirby around, but Rainbow Curse has squandered most of its charm. Despite the beautiful claymation art style and eye-candy coloring, the game is dull. Kirby's movement and abilities have been oversimplified to the point that getting Kirby actually to do what you want is a gamble. This, coupled with a watery story mode and unexciting bonus modes, makes Rainbow Curse feel soulless, disconnected from a franchise that has made some strong decisions in past iterations."", ""Movement in Rainbow Curse is minimalistic. Gameplay takes place entirely on the GamePad. To move Kirby forward, you tap him with the stylus, and he rolls. To switch directions, you draw a rainbow line in front of him, which he bumps into and then rolls the opposite way. Rolling him into certain types of blocks breaks them, and rolling onto an enemy's head kills it. To move Kirby up and through the air, you draw rainbow lines for him to roll along. Scattered through the environments are gold stars, and if Kirby collects 100, holding the stylus to the screen will charge him up for a more powerful attack that breaks metal and stone and damages larger enemies. He follows his lines dutifully, so draw them carefully."", ""Early levels are a breeze, but in later stages, Kirby's Jello-y physics makes them more difficult to complete. Stages are all slightly-different variants on each other, offering the same obstacles, just in different places. Sand and water you have to manipulate using lines, boxes you have to ram into, keys you have to collect to unlock the next area--some form of this was in every puzzle in every level, making things monotonous. I could expect at least one door to unlock in every first or second stage level. I knew Kirby would be a plane or tank come the last level before the boss fight. This pattern became familiar by the third stage, so I always knew what to expect and how to get around the pile of boxes in the room or collect the key. There isn't much variety to Rainbow Curse's stages of puzzle-solving."", ""Some puzzles and boss battles require quick reflexes, calling for a fast flick of the brush to paint a path to safety or change directions to bump a projectile back into an enemy's face. Guiding Kirby out of harm's way can prove difficult; he's a little slippery. Rainbow lines must be drawn quickly and strategically to roll him away, and sometimes even then, it's not enough to get the bugger. Kirby will roll along the top or bottom of a line depending on which side he touches, and if you're rolling on a line's underside and hit a wall, you're stuck, even if the line arcs over it and away. With this method, it's easy to back Kirby into corners, especially when the level includes a screen-moving component that means instant death if Kirby falls out of frame. More than once I drew lines hoping to bounce Kirby to safety but instead painted him into a corner. Kirby himself has also been granted some floaty physics this time around, making it feel like you're batting a bouncy cotton ball around the screen."", ""Every action besides drawing lines relies on tapping the GamePad--you never use the face buttons or triggers--and with everything mapped to a tap, navigation gets sticky quickly. In some levels, Kirby is transformed into a tiny plane, tiny tank, or tiny submarine. As the former, Kirby relies absolutely on the player to draw rainbow lines to guide him. When he's a tank or submarine, you tap to both move Kirby and shoot projectiles at the same time. Submarine missiles, however, need those rainbow lines to guide them to targets; otherwise, they will shoot straight ahead. It's monotonous and deeply frustrating to have both moves mapped to the one command. If Kirby is in the middle of the screen and you want to shoot enemies below you and move to the left to collect a star, you need to tap to Kirby's left and also draw rainbow lines to guide the missiles towards the bad guys. The submarine-Kirby and tank-Kirby levels are also constantly, slowly scrolling along, meaning you need to keep in frame to stay alive."", ""The game has an infuriating learning curve. Being bound to a one-directional line is limiting, and the game demands early mastery without giving you time to adapt. When Kirby is forced to become a plane or tank, it limits movement even further. Fine control is difficult in many instances, especially when Kirby is in these vehicle forms. Plane Kirby is particularly unwieldy, and many times I went to draw a line only to accidentally tap on Kirby and have him speed away from the desired direction. And in one late-game boss battle, Kirby spent most of the time hovering on the screen's edges, where I couldn't reach him with the stylus and where the rainbow lines refused to appear to guide him. He was in a corner I couldn't get him out of. The general line-drawing takes some getting used to, but even after becoming moderately comfortable, after seven whole words and 28 stages, I still never felt like I had proper control of Kirby due to his flighty nature."", ""Also, those rainbow lines? Your paint can run out, and you'll need to wait for a quick two- or three-second recharge before you can use it again. This adds a bit of resource management when crossing wide chasms and dealing with loads of projectile-shooting enemies, forcing you to keep an eye on your reserves. The challenge in Rainbow Curse lies in mastering drawing these lines, but frustration can reach an all-time high depending on how committed you are to getting it right."", ""Kirby typically feels floaty, because you inflate him to fly over obstacles and earn new powers by inhaling enemies. But you do neither of these things in Rainbow Curse. But Kirby feels useless here because the delicate physics don't quite sync with the mechanics. He can only roll into enemies or power up and roll into enemies, and if you roll into the enemy from the wrong angle--such as from the side or on top of its giant spiky head--you lose life. Some enemies jump or throw spears, and it's difficult to time how long it will take you to roll along a line and slam down on their heads before they sneak a hit in. Your only option is roll into them, though, so it's all you can do."", 'One way to get through the game is by literally babysitting Kirby, adding one to three other local players as his companion Waddle Dee to cover him to the finish line. Each Waddle Dee can jump, hover for a few moments, and slash enemies, totally free of the exasperating rainbow lines. I played with a friend as Waddle Dee, and he was able to do nearly everything without me; Kirby is needed to draw rainbow lines over un-jumpable spaces, and Waddle Dee took care of everything else solo. I played through several levels with my colleagues and nearly all of them preferred to grab Waddle Dee. It feels odd that the co-op character should be more powerful than the main hero.', ""There are a few more bells and whistles in Rainbow Curse that add content, but nothing incredibly interesting. Completing levels can unlock an additional stage that is accessible in Challenge mode. Each stage includes four small rooms packed with obstacles you've seen before; there's nothing here that isn't already offered somewhere in story mode. You must maneuver Kirby through each small room to a treasure chest. You only have 15 seconds to succeed in each room, and if you fail, you lose the challenge. These tiny contained challenges have no incentive to them, since they repeat ideas from the main campaign that have already been repeated umpteen times."", ""You can also use Amiibo with Rainbow Curse with some restrictions. Tapping a Kirby, Dedede, or MetaKnight Amiibo to the GamePad will grant you a power-up; Kirby lets you use his dash ability whenever you want, Dedede gives you two extra health bars, and MetaKnight makes Kirby more powerful. But you can only use one Amiibo once a day, and if you die just once, you lose the power-up and have to wait a day to use it again. Since losing life is an inevitability in Rainbow Curse, it's disappointing that the Amiibo bonus is something you can't hold on to for your entire playtime."", ""Kirby and the Rainbow Curse is a tiring game. It's taxing without being rewarding, like doing a mile on a stationary bike and discovering that you only burned away calories from one bite of your lunch burrito. The game gets frustrating quickly due to repetitive obstacles and there's not much incentive to dig into a game that won't give you that agency. It's a mediocre romp through a gorgeously detailed world that doesn't give you the control you need as a player, which ultimately dulls its shine.""]"Brett Todd,17-Feb-15,Heroes of Might and Magic III Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/heroes-of-might-magic-iii-hd-edition-review/1900-6416032/,6,PC,"[""Even if you don't remember the specifics, you may remember greatly enjoying the original Heroes of Might & Magic III--and perhaps getting lost in it for hours, days, weeks at a time. The new HD edition of the game is also likely to sink its claws into you, so great is its power to absorb your time and your thoughts. That said, I have more than a few significant misgivings about the re-release's cost and content, especially when compared with the more complete versions of the original game on sale elsewhere online."", 'Set aside the aforementioned caveats for a moment, though, and note that this revamped HOMM III is mostly like the fantastic original game. As the title indicates, Heroes of Might & Magic III HD is the same 16-year-old game with a facelift to satisfy modern tastes for high-resolution graphics. The gameplay is fundamentally identical: You take on the role of fantasy heroes in campaign scenarios, some 50 individual scenarios (most with stories and settings that make them play like mini-campaigns), and a number of local and online multiplayer modes of play. ', ""Activities are split between the three components of play: exploring, building cities, and engaging in combat. Exploring the world maps representing regions of the fantasy realm of Erathia is probably the most enjoyable part of HOMM III HD. There are an incredible number of goodies to be discovered, including resource pits, treasure piles, magical artifacts, wandering monsters, and even goofy treats like leprechauns with pots of gold. The intricate nature of these maps has long been a hallmark of the HOMM franchise. It's all a little ridiculous--you can't go five feet into the wilderness without tripping over a bunch of gems or running into a murderous pack of halberdiers--but the style perfectly brings to life a colorful, much-missed fantasy atmosphere that went out of vogue about the same time that Erol Otus stopped drawing the covers of D&D modules."", ""Combat runs a close second. Armies are fronted by heroes who level up and gain skills with might and magic as in any traditional Gygaxian RPG, but their ranks are filled with warriors, wizards, monsters, and more drawn from factions based on D&D archetypes. Castle comes with knights and angels, Inferno features imps and demons, Necropolis boasts wights and liches, Rampart is home to elves and unicorns, and so forth. Battles themselves are turn-based affairs taking place on hex maps, either out in the open or in sieges before city walls. The great variety of the units gives these scraps some real tactical texture. Armies need to be built smartly, with a real balance between melee and ranged units, or you'll inevitably get chewed up and spit out. Magic is also crucial. Your hero needs a reasonably thick spell book to be able to deal with larger battles, as the assistance of a well-timed fireball can mean the difference between victory and being vanquished."", ""Finally, you have to spend time conquering and then building up towns specific to each faction. Conquest is a big part of every scenario, as you need access to new cities on the maps to increase production levels, vary the types of troops you can create, and just generally creep your way to victory. This can get a little grind-happy after a while. The selection of buildings and upgrades is fairly limited. You max out buildings fairly quickly with your first city, then do it again, then do it again. There are also few meaningful differences between the cities of the factions. So basically, there is a lot of rinse, lather, and repeat going on here while you're cranking out streams of troops."", ""Even after the passage of going on two decades, HOMM III remains one a sprawling, immersive experience that can take over your life. Time hasn't had much impact on one of the biggest (you could easily play the game for hundreds of hours between the campaign scenarios, the skirmish maps, and online multiplayer) and best titles from the golden age of PC gaming. It actually is a bit shocking today by comparison with modern games. The sheer size and intricacy of the maps, the diversity of the units, and the challenge presented by the AI even on the easy difficulty setting is like stepping into an ice-cold shower first thing in the morning."", 'Your hero needs a reasonably thick spell book to be able to deal with larger battles.', ""I am particularly taken aback by how tough the game is in the beginning. I had to restart my opening campaign four times before I got back into the groove and figured out the proper pace. HOMM III always forced you to maintain a tricky balancing act. Hole up in your cities to build up sizable numbers of troops, and you give away the goodies on the map to adventurous opponents. Expand too soon, and your troops wind up spread too thin, opening the way for enemy armies to sneak behind you and capture your cities without a struggle. It's still impressive just how thin a line you have to walk in order to succeed. In addition, the artificial intelligence is formidable when playing solo. It cheats a little, as enemy forces always know your weaknesses and notice when you make dumb moves like leaving a city wide open. Suffice it to say, the bad guys here are never pushovers."", ""So HOMM III is just where you left it. That's good. And that's also bad, because publisher Ubisoft could have been more generous. First of all, HOMM III HD doesn't include the two expansion packs released for the original game, apparently due to the loss of the source code. Regardless of the reason, this HD edition is not the entire HOMM III package. That causes some concerns about pricing, as $14.99 for this game via Steam arguably gets you less than the HOMM III Complete version with both expansions selling for $9.99 at GOG.com. Granted, this cheaper edition is the unadorned original game in all of its pixelated glory. But seeing as you can apply a free--and quite good--high-definition mod to that original game, the differences suddenly become a lot less significant."", ' ', ""And the HD aspects of this re-release don't really amount to much. Yes, the game looks better, particularly in the combat screens, thanks to support for higher modern resolutions and widescreen monitors. Unit art has been dramatically upscaled, to the point where creatures look like little cartoons instead of the old-school colored blobs where you had to squint to make out a dragon's tail. But the animations are still rudimentary. Units just shrug when they rip off spells or swing swords. There are no frills whatsoever, so don't expect any snazzy cutscenes showing an ice bolt spell taking down a horde of skeletons. And some miscues spoil the presentation a little bit, mainly the way that map features like castle walls and other units in close combat frequently block key information like the number of units in a stack."", 'The main adventure map has some problems. While it is clearer than it was before, it still isn\'t actually clear--not even close. I had to constantly peer at the screen like an old man checking labels at the grocery store. Is that a gang of demons? Or is that an artifact? Is that odd-looking lump of grass just an odd-looking lump of grass, or is it something I can activate to grab some goodies? This map is also finicky when it comes to clicking, often demanding three and four tries to choose points of interest due to the game demanding that you select very precise spots before activating encounters. All in all, the ""Huh?"" factor is strong with this one, which can be frustrating in a turn-based game where wasting even the slightest bit of unit movement can kill you.', 'The sheer size and intricacy of the maps, the diversity of the units, and the challenge presented by the AI even on the easy difficulty setting is like stepping into an ice-cold shower first thing in the morning.', ""Even given the greatness at the heart of HOMM III, it is impossible to fully recommend the HD edition. Making such a legendary game accessible to a modern audience is always a good thing, but Ubisoft just didn't do enough here to set this refurbished version apart from the original and its free high-definition mod. More effort could have--and should have--been made to ensure that this would be the definitive and complete HOMM III that all fans of the series would have to have. As much as I loved this trip back in time, I would recommend that anyone else interested in the same sort of journey book it with a different and cheaper travel agent.""]"Josiah Renaudin,13-Feb-15,Criminal Girls: Invite Only Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/criminal-girls-invite-only-review/1900-6416030/,4,PlayStation Vita,"['Criminal Girls: Invite Only is a perverted, uncomfortable crack at a role-playing game. You find the trappings of a standard turn-based adventure here, from the incessant random battles to the monumental bosses with seemingly endless hit points. The multi-floored dungeons and rich progression system can last you dozens of hours, but with whipping the sinful desires of young girls acting as one of the core hooks, its difficult to take Criminal Girls seriously. What could have been a basic, if uninspired, JRPG is ultimately little more than a sleazy grab at an audience pining to watch bloated bosoms bounce at the touch of the Vitas front and back screens. The overall package isnt wholly without merit, but Criminal Girls is far too focused on satiating raw desire in lieu of promoting its few interesting features.', 'The peculiar narrative does little to contextualize the near-nudity and hyper-sexualized moments. You find yourself deep in the bowels of Hell as the game opens, greeted by an officious warden who tasks you with taking care of a medley of sinful souls. These female delinquents have been damned to a life in Hades, but if they can pass the Redemption Program and overcome the challenges ahead, their sins will be forgiven. Of course, each of the seven unique characters has been banished and disregarded for a reason, so it takes time to gain their trust and convince them to actually earn the right to be redeemed.', 'Relationships among the girls are built and then tested as you climb out of Hell, but one of the keys to unlocking special skills and stat boosts is through individual motivation. After gaining the universal currency through battles and treasure chests, you can choose the Motivate option at any save point to whip, drip liquids on, or tickle any of the delinquents. During these sequences--which become more involved as your character progresses--your girl of choice either sheepishly or aggressively questions your intentions as she dons an outfit that ranges from risque to borderline pornographic. If you want your party to reach its full potential, your participation in these shameless sequences is necessary.', 'And surprisingly, these scenes were even more explicit in Japan. This is a touched-up edition of a PSP game released in 2010, with the motivation scenes being edited so that pink steam obfuscates portions of the screen before eventually dissipating at your touch. Moans and groans have also been removed, but somehow, the silence is even more unsettling.', 'The whole process is vulgar and unnecessary. The basic dialogue that litters your journey can be crude, drawing attention to one of the characters breasts or bottom. But going from cheap sexual jokes to rubbing a stripped-down teenager on your Vita screen is a thematic leap thats not only jarring but repellent. The story isnt stellar by any means, but any emotional connection you build with these characters from dungeon to dungeon is immediately snapped once you throw them into such compromising positions.', 'Itd be easy just to disregard Criminal Girls: Invite Only if the surrounding elements were just as tasteless. However, the actual video game part, where you battle monsters and raise levels, is fun, and pretty novelbesides. Instead of controlling the action of all four party members in a given turn, you pick just one of four options. One girl might feel bold and want to do a solo attack, while another decides that an elemental ability is the best course of action. As your characters grow closer and learn new abilities, new provisional avenues appear. By the end, its common to see all four girls working together to dole out damage as a team or maybe even combine for a special duo ability dealing triple damage.', 'These combat quirks add a healthy dose of diversity to the moment-to-moment action. You have to scroll through your options and pick the proper technique for the given situation rather than simply hammer away at the X button until youve earned a victory jingle. The many useful offensive and defensive skills that become available make each of the seven characters useful, meaning that you likely wont pigeonhole yourself to a specific combination of characters.', 'Surprisingly, the combat stays mostly fresh even in the face of innumerable random battles. Theres a medley of monsters waiting to greet you after every few feet, and the story often asks you to retrace your steps over and over again. If the environments were interesting, this wouldnt be a major problem. Unfortunately, trudging up and down a featureless bend isnt fun or exciting, and doing so just to make the bustiest member of your crew sweat through her top to grab the attention of a carnal boss isnt a good enough excuse. Its just a poor way to pad out an already lengthy experience.', 'You can escape from battles, but its not a wise decision if you hope to progress. Each floor of this dungeon crawler presents stronger enemies, so youll have to grind early and often to pass the later trials. I spent hours strengthening my party before attempting major battles but still found myself struggling because most of the late-game bosses use frequent healing techniques to make most of your offensive efforts toothless.', 'The turn-based action might be fun, but every other element of Criminal Girls: Invite Only does its best to stamp out its only saving grace. When its not pushing discomforting images of barely dressed teens in your face, Criminal Girls is leading you back and forth across a lifeless dungeon just so you can thumb through lines of dull dialogue. Theres enjoyment to be found within the games combat, but its just not worth stomaching the tedious design and perverse activities to find the pearl inside.']"Nick Capozzoli,12-Feb-15,Total War: Attila Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/total-war-attila-review/1900-6416029/,7,PC,"['In his travelogue A Time of Gifts, Patrick Leigh Fermor describes a stopover at an inn along the Danube, en route to Istanbul in the winter of 1933. He falls into conversation there--as Paddy is wont to do--about regional history with a local polymath. For Fermor\'s benefit, the older man sketches ancient civilization out on the back of his copy of the Neue Freie Presse--the Marcomanni tribe here, the Quadi there--little circles of semi-permanent existence alongside the Danube\'s sinuous line. ""And suddenly, at last something happens,"" exclaims the polymath, invoking Attila and his horde with a slash of graphite through the Viennese classifieds. ""Everything starts changing place at full speed! Chaos!""', 'The sudden flurry of activity is a welcome change of pace to Fermor, a 20th-century student with wanderlust. Probably less so to the Quadi and the Marcomanni. But someone playing Total War: Attila has more in common with the former--there\'s no fun in watching civilizations, to hear Paddy put it, ""float about as lonely as clouds, expanding across the map as imperceptibly as damp or mildew."" And so in that limited sense, the Huns are a welcome arrival to Total War\'s late antiquity. Finally, something to upend the dreary peace!', ""Total War: Attila is centered on its turn-based Grand Campaign, a broad representation of the military situation Europe found itself in around 400 A.D. The Roman Empire is in its death throes, bloated and harried even after being cleaved into Eastern and Western halves. To the north and northeast, perennial all-barbarian first-teamers the Vandals and Visigoths flee from the Huns' onslaught--straight into Roman territory. To the east, the comparatively recumbent Sassanians lie within striking distance of Constantinopolis. A litany of small but active tribes occupy the interstitial spaces, cannibalizing each other and nipping impishly at the heels of the larger factions. All eyes are drawn to the eastern steppes, however, when Attila enters the world stage, providing a not-so-subtle cue to start getting your affairs in order."", ""Lest there be any confusion about the stakes, Total War: Attila's cutscenes and campaign descriptions regularly invoke the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. But Death himself can be slow coming, depending on your chosen faction--Attila still has to grow up before the gears of the Hunnic war machine really start to turn, so it can be some time before he makes his presence known to those in the far corners of the map. In the meantime, Famine proves to be a more immediate concern, as does Disease, both of which need to be mitigated through the construction of relevant buildings in one's home cities. A waterworks system, for example, confers sanitation +2, public order +1, while a sheep pen does as much for statistics like food surplus and wealth."", ""War, for his part, is an old hand by now. The series' battle engine is set in its ways; save a few new wrinkles in the siege system or the way fire spreads, it's mostly content to demonstrate mastery of those skills it already possessed. As opposed to the turn-by-turn politicizing, battles take place in real time, across fields or along castle ramparts, between collected armies that are, if not a one-to-one representation of the thousands of soldiers present, close enough in abstraction to dissuade you from counting. Your units engage the enemy's automatically when the two collide, leaving you to concern yourself with formations."", 'Lest there be any confusion about the stakes, Total War: Attila regularly analogizes the Horde to the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.', ""If that sounds simplistic, it's because you haven't seen how many formations there are to choose from--to say nothing of the stances and abilities that can be toggled on each individual unit, or the passive qualities like morale or fatigue that themselves hinge on dozens of other factors. If there were any doubts, let it be known that Total War: Attila retains the series' depth of strategic offerings. But for the uninitiated and leery, it's entirely possible to play par golf on normal difficulty armed only with an understanding of the series' now-familiar unit rock-paper-scissors. Swords beat spears, spears beat cavalry, cavalry beat swords. And generally speaking, everyone hates having arrows lobbed at their heads. Once armies clash, you never concern yourself with any individual soldier. Instead, you command armies as the Sorcerer's Apprentice commanded waves and lighting, pointing out what you want done and watching a wave of spearmen break off in that direction like a tributary branching from a roaring river."", ""Most of the quirks of Total War's artificial intelligence have been ironed out by now: it properly diverts forces to prevent dead runs at the main capture point of its bases, and those old instances of units spinning aimlessly have yet to rear their heads. But Attila is not without its idiosyncrasies. Battles can occur at sea, but naval skirmishes remain a mess of sails and hulls, a paltry imitation of their counterparts on land. Back on terra firma, units occasionally show their displeasure with your commands by sprinting headlong in the wrong direction, particularly when you try to send them up a siege ladder. Then there's the curious case of the Vandal general at Ad Decimum, who will refuse to break his tidy formation to chase off a single unit of horse archers sent out to pester him."", ""You don't need a field manual to beat an enemy like that, but for what it's worth, Total War: Attila's tutorial prologue is comprehensive, and a good precursor to the Grand Campaign. It has its limitations, though--perhaps inevitable when you've got an interface that's as complex as Photoshop and half as intuitive. Information like, say, the cost of unit upkeep, is lost among the icons and numbers that are tucked into each of the screen's corners."", ""Speaking of too much information: every member of your chosen faction's royal family has a set of qualities that affect his or her statistics, and let's just note that flaccid is one of them and continue on. There are wives that affect stats, companions who affect stats, even random little trinkets like necklaces and scrolls that affect stats. Imagine, if the scales of rebellion truly tipped on some statesman getting a particularly shiny bracelet! Absent that hyperspecificity, the returning familial power system is welcome. Family members and statesmen accrue influence, which can be leveraged into political actions. Influence needs to be wielded to avoid losing control of your faction, so running low can mean ceding a percentage of your control every time the game springs a political event on you, like a power play from a rival or an inopportune marriage. Neglect your influence, and each time it'll be another -2% control, -2% control...death by thrown shade."", 'That granularity flows into all of Total War: Attila\'s historical representations--here, it\'s not Istanbul, it\'s Constantinopolis. This a game that\'s got its Latin roots in mind when it suggests that you might need to ""decimate"" your troops to deal with failing integrity. It certainly seems to put a tax on the in-game encyclopedia, which regularly fails to load properly (though it should be noted that the review copy\'s encyclopedia is online-only). The whole game regularly seems to struggle under the weight of its own persnickety attention to detail, stuttering when the map is panned even when graphical settings are tuned down. It\'s uncanny to watch the seabirds that float above the game world\'s coasts sputter out and stall whenever you click ""end turn.""', ""Each of those turns represents quite a bit of data: each one a season, each season a time to specify constructions or appointments, or expend a unit's action points towards movement, raids, or out-and-out battle. Scale translates well on the world map, generally speaking: forests allow concealment, and distinctive masses like the great Arabian Desert represent near-impassable natural barriers. Total War does stoop to representing armies on the world map with single avatars, a rare moment of generalization."", ""It's a beautiful map, really. Its deciduous trees have a lovely, fungal sort of grunginess to them, like anything viewed through an electron microscope (though they do turn a bit fractal when viewed from directly overhead). Sand looks like it was cascaded over real rock and dirt. Select a settlement, and its illuminated by god rays. Waves sound along the coast, sometimes pierced by a shout from a unit that's been set to raid a nearby trade route. This never fails to sound like a bunch of people pranked their fellow soldier with the old let's tell Maximus that we're all going to yell HRUAGGGH at the count of three then totally not do anything gag."", 'Raiding isn\'t considered an act of war, strangely enough. So you can sue for peace with a neighbor, then promptly start pillaging your way across their country. They\'re unable to retaliate lest they suffer the betrayal penalty for all other factions. There are a few other tics of note here, too. Sometimes messages need to be clicked twice to confirm them. The ""show/hide deceased"" toggle in the family tree menu doesn\'t appear to work. More egregiously, if you assign a statesman to a provincial governing slot, the decision appears to immediately and irrevocably transport him across the thousands of miles to his destination--try to recall him, and you\'ll be told that he needs to travel back. It\'s the one time when I wish the game would ask me to click twice to confirm.', ""On the world map, the opponent empire AI seems cautious by nature, rarely pressing an offensive. Enemies are not sleepwalking, though--if they catch you trying to send an ambush force deep into their empire they'll crush it with overpowering force. Other than that, though, they seem mostly content to maintain their border wherever it lies at the time. Newly introduced puppet states hold up their end of the bargain, though: on more than one occasion they've chased separatist fighters away from my besieged cities, and they regularly seem to harry enemy forces. They're a little too eager to use the new ability to raze cities, though, so its probably best to step in before they go and annihilate a city you'd been eying."", 'Unless you\'re playing as the Huns, that is. Then you\'ll probably want to do the razing yourself. They\'re fast, dangerous with bows, and packing a fear-inducing bonus against Christian factions. They--and the Vandals and Goths--eschew stationary living for slightly different pick-up-and-go versions of the same structures the other factions build. Don\'t expect to be the dominant force right out of the gate, however: the nomads and migrating tribes of Total War: Attila face the steepest initial difficulty. You might begin not with a city to rest in, but only with your nomadic units themselves, playing mouse to other factions\' cats until you come to terms with the wandering life and learn to make a home wherever the heart and Horde are. These factions are fun to play as, highly mobile and free from some of the fussier portions of the game\'s political realm, carrying their culture in their saddlebags, driving the ""civilized"" world before them like a flock of sheep.', 'As the Huns, you upend the status quo, even if Total War: Attila itself doesn\'t represent a major disruption. Austere writing, along with campaigns that come to a close rather quickly compared to many games of this ilk, come as a surprise given battles of such enormous scale, and given systems that allow you to poke and prod at so many fine details. At least the production values fulfill the promise of historical grandiosity, including a militant musical score that brilliantly anchors the game\'s atmosphere. ""Everything starts changing place at full speed!"" it calls out. ""Chaos!"" it cries, echoing the mighty Huns as they raze the landscape. Attila is more of the same and a little bit extra, then, not as convincingly realized as the best Total Wars, but strong enough to keep you clicking until the inevitable patches and expansions trickle in.']"Cameron Woolsey,10-Feb-15,The Escapists Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-escapists-review/1900-6416028/,8,Xbox One & PC,"[""I must have counted those 12 paces a dozen times, but once more I rattle them off in my head: one, two, three, four, five, six.... From the hole I dug in my cell, covered from sight the majority of the time by my storage desk, to under the prison wall and, at last--one, two, three, four, five, six, a dozen more times--to the fresh air, the singing birds. One, two, three, four...I can't afford to this screw up, not again. That night, as the guards patrolled the darkened corridors, I reached the end of an underground tunnel I spent the last two weeks digging. I reached that twelfth step, just beyond that accursed concrete barrier, readied a shovel crafted from a sheet of metal and duct tape, looked up, and began to dig--one month to walk 12 steps, but it was worth the wait."", 'I am a prisoner no longer; I am an escapist.', ""If history and Hollywood have taught us anything, it's that breaking out of prison isn't exactly a cakewalk. And though it won't take you 19 years of tunneling through a wall with a rock hammer, The Escapists, a game about escaping prison, doesn't make the monumental task all that easy, either. Much like the bygone era of video games from which it derives its colorful, pixelated aesthetic, The Escapists is tough and refuses to hold your hand, leading to many hours of trial-and-error experiments as you test the walls of your confines. But like a beam of hope shining through the damp dirt of an escape tunnel, the tribulation is worth it in the end. The Escapists is challenging and tense, but also engaging and deeply enjoyable. It will take you hours to figure out how to escape your first prison, but if you're tough enough and clever enough to breach the walls, the feeling of triumph accompanying your newfound freedom will completely wash away all the blood, sweat, and tears that paved the way."", 'In The Escapists, your task as an inmate is to plot an escape route, all while under the watchful eyes of ever-suspicious prison guards. You enter a life ruled by routine. From the moment the early morning sun touches the prison walls, until it leaves the sky, you are shuffled into your daily stations: roll call, breakfast, work, exercise block, shower, evening meal--all of which, save for roll calls and meals, vary between the game\'s six prisons. Deviating from your rigid schedule, getting into fights, or getting caught snooping around another inmate\'s cell quickly earns the ire of the guards. ""Get to it, Cam!"" they shouted at me the moment I was caught meandering through the halls. ""Stations, Cam!"" The more you push their buttons, the higher the on-screen heat meter rises. If it reaches 90 percent or more, guards rush you at first sight, batons swinging, rewarding your tangential behavior with some bruises and a swift visit to the infirmary. But investigate you must, as every historic breakout needs to start with a plan and a keen understanding of your new home.', 'Escaping requires cunning, strategy, and proper equipment, and staying at least five steps ahead of your pursuers is essential to securing your freedom. The beauty of The Escapists, however, is that there is no wrong way to go about it. You could swipe plastic spoons and forks from the canteen and use them to dig a tunnel out of your cell. Or perhaps, as you walk the grounds during your work station as a gardener, you notice that if you take the job of the tailor (another inmate), you will gain access to a room that shares a wall with an enclosed, empty space. Disrupting him on his way to work gets him fired, allowing you to take the job, bust down the wall, and replace it with a poster. And just like that, you have an area to store tools and other materials, or even to start a tunnel, safe and secure from prying eyes. Completing favors for inmates earns you some extra dough to line your pockets with, and--along with handing out gifts or cashalso raises their opinion of you. If they like you enough, you can recruit them and create your very own chain gang to terrorize both prisoners and guards alike. Gain enough followers, and its possible to take over a prison. I haven\'t done it yet myself, but it can be accomplished, as the developer notes, with ""a lot of rope.""', ""And there are so many other possibilities. You can knock out guards and use a putty mold to copy a key, shimmy down walls with a grappling hook, or even impersonate a guard. Whatever steps you choose to take feel personal and never scripted. It's a surprisingly deep and complex system that I didn't expect but quickly fell in love with. It's highly malleable and widely varied, allowing you to make every trip to the Big House a different experience, while staving off dull repetition."", ""Along the way you spend time developing the game's light RPG attributes: strength, speed, and intellect. The former two go toward your proficiency in fights, with strength pulling double duty by adding to your overall health. Intellect, however, is the most paramount of the bunch, as it requires a level of smarts to craft certain items. In other words, you can be weak and slow, but it's nigh unto improbable for a dumb criminal to manage a breakout. Skill progression requires that you spend some extra time sweating in an exercise area for strength and speed, while you gather more intellect by popping open a book in the library or browsing the Internet on a computer, though you will need to take a break during these activities to decrease your mounting fatigue. Points added to your abilities slowly decrease over time, making it necessary to boost them back up every so often."", ""At times, fellow inmates--indicated by a flashing gold bag above their head--will offer items to purchase. What goods are available is completely random, and their usefulness to you pivots on what you need to make your escape. Sometimes you'll find hot items such as duct tape, (which is worth its weight in gold), a screwdriver, or nail files; but on other occasions, only soap or a packet of mints. The suppliers, as well as the items being sold, change randomly throughout a given day, so you need to stay on top of who is selling, and what. Rifling through the desks of other inmates, as well as the pockets of unconscious prisoners following one of the many prison fights, may also yield materials. But again, what you find is random."", 'Materials purchased or ""borrowed"" from your fellow inmates are used to craft tools and other items. Throughout the game, you gather an eclectic mishmash of components such as wires, a bottle of bleach, a piece of timber, a bar of chocolate, a plastic comb, and much more. All of which, believe it or not, can be vital pieces in your escape--yes, even the chocolate, but you\'ll need to find a lighter and a small blue cup first. You can throw up to three items into the crafting menu and hope that you will create something of use, but you\'re probably better off finding or purchasing crafting recipes as you go along. The best tools are those fit for the job, so if you\'re keen on digging your way to freedom, creating a shovel is your best bet. Or, if you\'re feeling sneaky, you can fashion a makeshift guard uniform using a tub of bleach, prison clothes, and some blue ink. There are dozens of craftable items, including a pickaxe, wire cutters, zip lines, and more, all of which play a role in many escape plans.', ""It is, however, equally important to remember that these items are contraband. Distinguishable by a red name, contraband is confiscated if you're caught. Mistakes are costly, and one slip-up leaves you with nothing to show for your troubles other than bruised pride and a trip to solitary confinement. Failure in The Escapists can be downright heartbreaking. An error can be simple, such as forgetting to replace a vent cover or carelessly leaving tunnel dirt in a place where it can be discovered and traced back to you. Once, a tunnel filled with tools I had built and collected was discovered, and I lost everything, putting my progress back about six hours. More difficult prisons are dotted with contraband detectors, and if you pass through one with something prohibited in your pocket, the heat meter rises to 99 percent, causing any nearby guard to make a beeline straight to you."", ""Beyond getting caught, there are other things that can go wrong, but theyre mostly on a technical level. The game has bugs, the most innocent of which are times when you can see the name of an item hidden in a tunnel below by hovering your mouse pointer over an item one floor above. Worse, however, are issues that can hinder an escape, such as a bug that turned a fake fence I installed into a real one, and I didn't notice the error until it was too late--this happened more than once. And then were the several times I couldn't break through the dirt in order to leave a tunnel. Other problems are merely irritating, such as overlapping text when completing the same favor for two different people. At times, items disappear from the pockets of unconscious prisoners. I could never tell if it was the guards that found and took them, but I do recall moments when items would vanish into the ether without anyone else being close enough to touch the body. Also, I can't understand the logic behind the heat meter refusing to decrease after I fall asleep. And I'm not a fan of the fact that the first thing I eat in the morning is a club sandwich (well, more like a baton, but the joke doesn't work that way)."", ""Despite its foibles, The Escapists is a gratifying game that provides dozens of hours of entertainment. Planning an escape and watching it unfold is endlessly satisfying, and a successful breakout leaves you feeling jubilant. Even after you master the game's six prisons, there are three extras waiting to be challenged. The Escapists will have even more to show as time goes on, according to the developer, which is currently working on a free standalone application that will allow you to create and share your own prisons. You might not want to live in one of The Escapists' prisons, but you will definitely enjoy the visit."", ' ']"Sean Bell,10-Feb-15,Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/monster-hunter-4-ultimate-review/1900-6416021/,9,3DS,"[""Rejoice, for Capcom has seen fit to release a new Monster Hunter game in the West. It doesn't always bother, see--that's why we've skipped straight to Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate without stopping to try Monster Hunter 4 first. You can hardly blame Capcom, though. Over here, the series has never enjoyed the same popularity as it has closer to home, and even among its fans it has a reputation for being difficult to get into, thanks to its frankly ludicrous array of deep combat and resource management systems."", ""Sure enough, Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate isn't without its challenges, but there's a fantastically compelling game at the heart of it all, if you can see past its steep learning curve. For those who don't know, the Monster Hunter games are action-RPGs, where you do battle against dozens of giant monsters, take their body parts, and use them to fashion new weapons and armour with which to do battle against more giant monsters--except it is much more complicated than it sounds, which is why its such a brilliant series is so brilliant, and also why so many people struggle with it."", ""Clearly, this is something Capcom's concerned with, too. Some of the previous games in the series threw you in at the deep end, but gave you separate, optional tutorials to play through, which was a little clumsy. Now the approach is more elegant; tutorials are extended and disguised as part of the main campaign. It's an approach that might irritate veterans (though they are given the option to skip some of the tutorial text early on), but it makes things far easier for newcomers."", ""That said, you still have to do some research outside of the game if you want to master its intricacies. Short tutorials for each of the game's 14 weapon types are present and correct, but a full tutorial for any one of them could run to the same length as this entire review. Each weapon type not only features its own array of attacks, but also its own unique mechanics, giving you numerous options in how you approach combat. The new Insect Glaive, for example, is a bladed staff paired with a giant insect that lives on your arm. You throw the insect at monsters in order to extract juice from them. The insect then feeds the juice into the staff to improve your abilities in various ways, depending on the type of extract. Then there's the Hunting Horn, a giant musical instrument that requires you to learn specific three-note sequences in order to provide your hunting party with status buffs."", 'Monsters are far from your typical video-game fodder. Each one is an incredibly intricate set of abilities, behaviours, and quirks that need to be observed and understood before you can reliably take them down.', ""It's well worth studying up on your weapons, though. Enter a fight unprepared and what could have been an exciting yet efficient hunt quickly turns into a multi-hour showdown, with a very high chance of failure at the end. These monsters are far from your typical video-game fodder. Each one is an incredibly intricate set of abilities, behaviours, and quirks that need to be observed and understood before you can reliably take them down."", ""With each deftly placed dodge, and with each eager swipe of your sword, you get a little wiser and a little closer to taking down the most imposing of beasts. These battles are Monster Hunter's bread and butter, and they remain as enthralling as ever. Sure, everything the monsters do is predictable once you learn to spot the various hints that give away their next move--and you might well face off against the same monsters dozens of times--but it's a testament to the game's depth that this rarely gets stale. Until you're deftly avoiding every single attack, there's still something to learn."", ""New players often complain that the combat feels stiff, and it's not hard to see why. Certain attacks lock your character in place while he swishes his sword around in thin-air, making it all too easy for an adversary to come at you from the side and take a third of your health off. It's a perfectly understandable frustration--every Monster Hunter player, from amateur to pro, will have been through the exact same thing at one point--but with some experience you begin to learn that the game simply wants you to take your movement and positioning seriously."", ""Every single button press has a real weight to it, because if you dont know how your next attack will make you move, where it will make you stand, and how long it'll be before you can do something else, you're likely to get your face torn off. The moment-to-moment thought processes and constant split-second decisions youre forced to make will be more familiar to anyone well versed in beat-'em-ups than your typical action-RPG, perhaps--and that's a wonderful thing indeed in a game that demands so much of your time in battle. That said, those who've previously struggled with this aspect of the series will find little to convert them here."", ""In addition to the two new weapon types, there are monsters you can mount in order to deal significant damage, or sometimes to break off rare parts. However, you can't actually jump, but instead must rely on using the terrain to position yourself above the monster and then hop down onto it from above. It's tricky to pull off--and certainly easier in multiplayer, where you can coordinate your aerial attack with your chums--but its satisfying as hell when it works. If you're having trouble, there's always the Insect Glaive's ability to pole-vault around at will. Expect to see plenty of people using that online."", ""That said, the mounting is a little disappointing when stacked up against the likes of Capcom stablemate Dragon's Dogma, which allowed you to grab an enemy from any given point and climb around on it, Shadow of the Colossus-style. Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate, on the other hand, simply triggers a cutscene where you land on the monster's back and then play a short minigame where you alternate between hacking it to death and holding on for dear life. It's fun, but Capcom can clearly do better."", ""There's been some noise about Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate being released alongside the New 3DS, because it features sharper textures, faster loading times and, of course, proper camera control with the C-stick on the new handheld. But if you're on a crusty old regular 3DS and don't feel like upgrading, I wouldn't worry--the game looks, runs, and plays well without any of these benefits. Even the camera control is less of an issue than it was in the past, thanks to the complete removal of Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate's frustrating underwater combat. The standard lock-on camera is much more sufficient now that you dont have do any scuba-diving, and the old 'claw hand' technique that many players adopted to play the game on PSP and 3DS mostly isn't necessary here."", ""An interesting addition is Expedition mode, a superb feature for players who feel a bit directionless and just want to get into a ruck with some prehistoric beasts. Upon starting an expedition, you're left to explore a randomly picked series of pre-built areas, populated with random monsters that you've met elsewhere. You don't have to kill them, but acquiring the proof that you've tussled with one of them (by cutting off its tail, for example) and bringing it to the end of the expedition yields rewards. It's a really neat idea if you just fancy throwing yourself into a fight without the preparation that a typical hunt entails."", ""The campaign itself is structured slightly differently from previous entries in the series. Rather than being one village's designated hunter, instead you travel around with a caravan, solving the problems of the various towns you find yourself in. This gives the game a very welcome boost in pace compared with previous entries in the series. Another nice touch is that you now get quests by actually having conversations with people, rather than simply by picking them from a list, which gives the game's brilliantly localised and genuinely funny dialogue more chance to shine."", ""Those quests aren't all terrifying battles with giant monsters, either. As a way of maintaining your supply of items, you spend a fair amount of time going on harvest tours--wandering around hunting grounds, picking flowers, or going fishing. Every consumable item, from healing items to poo-bombs that you throw at monsters to make them go away (not a joke), is made from stuff you can find lying around in the world. Sometimes it's really nice to hunt a few defenceless herbivores, take their meaty flanks to the nearest scenic cliff, whip out a barbecue, and cook up a few stamina-replenishing steaks like some kind of genuine sociopath."", ""That said, it's likely you'll spend most of your time playing online, this time without first having to link your 3DS to a Wii U. As great as the single-player experience is, taking your skills and knowledge and using them when youre part of a team is something else entirely. Progression through the multiplayer missions runs entirely separately from the single-player campaign, despite following a similar tier system where later missions are closed off until a certain number of earlier ones are cleared, and you use the same character throughout. However, the difficulty of multiplayer missions scales considerably to take extra players into account. Just because you've taken down a Great Jaggi in single-player without breaking a sweat doesn't mean you can slack off when hunting one as a team."", ""Previous entries in the series also did this, but scaled the difficulty up for a full team of four at all times, making it incredibly difficult to hunt with just one or two friends. MH4 Ultimate, on the other hand, seems to scale depending on the number of players in the group. I've spent a good few evenings hunting with just one other player, and the difficulty level was spot-on. Finding your friends is also a breeze, because the game seamlessly hooks into your 3DS friends list and allows you to instantly join any of your contacts who are currently playing online. The drama of a good hunt is definitely best shared with friends, and hearing everyone roar in unison upon taking down a particularly ferocious beast is one of the finest experiences videogames have to offer. Unfortunately, to hear those roars you have to use a third-party service like Skype, due to the curious omission of voice chat."", ""Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate manages to expand upon the things that people love about the series, while simultaneously making concessions to those getting involved for the first time. It's an absolutely astonishing time-sink, but it rarely feels like a grind; when the game gets its hooks into you, you can expect to find yourself engrossed for at least 80 hours. Those who become truly invested can expect to find their in-game clock running into the hundreds of hours. Sure, Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate isn't without some of the series' time-honoured idiosyncrasies, but it's the most streamlined and accessible game yet, and one that's hard not to truly obsess over.""]"Don Saas,9-Feb-15,Raven's Cry Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/raven-s-cry-review/1900-6416027/,1,PC,"[""Gather 'round, ye sons and daughters of landlubbers. Draw up a pint, and listen to a tale. A tale of single-digit frame-rates and computer crashes that will make you want to shove yer hook through yer monitor. It's a tale of deeply unsettling gendered violence and racist slaughter played for casual drama. The tale's written in the language of cheap misogyny and homophobia, and if yer willing to see this story through to its conclusion, ye've more patience than I (and a magical copy of the game free of the bug that makes completion literally impossible at the time of this writing)."", ""That stylistic introduction is honestly more than Raven's Cry, the pirate-themed adventure role-playing game from Two Worlds developer Reality Pumps Studio, could ever deserve. In an age where shaky launches have become a sad norm, Raven's Cry makes most buggy games seem as polished as the floors of Versailles. The game is playable in the barest sense of the word in those moments where it's not hard-crashing your computer, and the game's writing is so tone-deaf and offensive and mean-spirited that playing the game for more than a couple of hours at a time can begin to take an emotional toll. It's the type of game where the only moments that you don't hate yourself for continuing to play it are those where it's merely tedious instead of utterly broken."", ' ', ""In Raven's Cry, you take the reins of Christopher Raven, a sneering and loathsome pirate in the 1700s. Christopher's story begins when a job turns sour, and the Spanish navy nearly burns down an entire Caribbean town to get to him. Christopher sets out to get revenge against the Spaniard who betrayed him, but it isn't long in your adventure before you come across the wreckage of a ship left by Christopher's arch-nemesis, a man who raped and murdered Christopher's mother when he was a boy. And, thus, Christopher begins to sail across the breadth of the Caribbean in search of that man's former crew so he can murder one of the few people in this game's universe who is more horrible than he is."", 'If that story seems like the traditional revenge fare that has become increasingly popular in recent years, ""stale"" is an adjective that Raven\'s Cry wishes could be used to describe itself. Out of the gates, Raven\'s Cry gives the impression that large chunks of story and writing were left on the cutting-room floor. Characters, motivations, and places appear without context or explanation but with a strange assumption that the player can follow who these figures are. And bland incomprehensibility is the game\'s strong suit.', 'When Raven\'s Cry writing is memorable, it becomes so for all the wrong reasons. Though it has seemingly been patched out since launch, the ""barks"" of your ship\'s crew mostly consist of gendered and homophobic slurs. I haven\'t heard the male iteration of the ""c"" word this often since Deadwood (and with none of David Milch\'s redemptive style). And don\'t worry. The female ""c"" word pops up just as often as well. Christopher openly insults black people in the face of his black first mate--who disappears for seemingly no reason early in the game. And, also early in the game, Christopher physically assaults a sex worker to gain information for a quest. Villains casually joke about rape. Tribal natives are treated as mindless cannibal savages that you slaughter in high numbers. The game has the cultural sensitivity of Birth of a Nation, and I needed a bath to wash away the grime of this game\'s world every time I stopped playing.', '""Stale"" is an adjective that Raven\'s Cry wishes could be used to describe itself.', ""The actual gameplay is broken into two primary segments: ship-to-ship combat and on-foot exploration/combat. Neither works well, although the ship combat is the least broken of the two. Ship combat plays out similarly to that of Assassin's Creed III (specifically before Black Flag updated those systems), where you line up broadside to systematically take out enemy ship hulls and sails (and the crew if you wish to board). Precision is relegated to set increments for the height of your shots, so if a ship is in a frustrating grey area between two shot levels, you're out of luck."", ""At the beginning of Raven's Cry, it's not uncommon to think that ship combat is simply impossible. Raven's Cry opens up the entire world map almost right out of the gates, it gives you little information about which combat engagements you have any hope of surviving, and it never informs you that fleeing from a ship battle is a potential option--and a necessity at the beginning of the game. The world of Raven's Cry's is enormous, and you may find yourself wanting to sail off--through an entirely abstracted menu experience--to the farthest isles of the Caribbean only to find your puny schooner up against frigates, galleons, and men of war. It took me literally hours to get even the most basic feel for the ship combat, and even then, one-on-one battles with another schooner mostly come down to luck and patience until you get your first couple of upgrades. Ship warfare becomes much more bearable after you get the second ship, but it's never enjoyable."", 'Ground combat is swordplay without much play. The game offers you ways to block and dodge and a meter that you can fill up to perform one-hit kills, but attempting to get fancy with your rapier is both a waste of time and a surefire way to end up dead. Raven\'s Cry suffers from awful input delay when it isn\'t just ignoring your button presses altogether. The simple act of opening a door requires multiple presses of the ""X"" button if you\'re playing on a gamepad, and trying to block with that system will get you cut to shreds. It\'s much more efficient to mindlessly mash the attack button until everyone around you is dead and--if necessary--open the menu to use a health potion. The game\'s collision detection is impressively variable, failing to recognize some clear and direct hits while also occasionally letting you kill enemies when your blade is meters away from anything.', ""Land exploration is as frustrating as land combat. Christopher can barely walk in a straight line because the camera swings around worse than a drunken sailor. That isn't always a pain, but on the rare occasions when the game requires you to navigate a tight path without rails or sides, it's too easy and too common to fall over the edge to your death or to water. Christopher can't even walk over ankle-high obstacles that aren't explicitly stairs--and occasionally he can't even walk over those--without having to rely on his awkward and uncontrollable jumping skill. The towns and islands in the game offer an impressive scale and sense of verticality, but Christopher can jump about as well as the Monstars from Space Jam before they steal Charles Barkley's powers, so don't hold out any hope of climbing around these sometimes huge spaces."", ""The presentation of Raven's Cry is as shoddy as its writing and mechanics. You may have to turn every single graphical option to its lowest setting or off to get the frame rate of Raven's Cry to a playable state. The frame rate still stuttered and chugged during sea battles or any time there was rain (which is often in this game), but it was usable. It did leave the environments in Raven's Cry looking like something out of a late-period PlayStation 2 game, though, with character models that were only slightly better."", ""There are elements of the presentation that aren't broken simply because they aren't finished. Large chunks of the dialogue in Raven's Cry are missing. Characters will be having a voiced conversation when suddenly a character's lips will keep moving but no sounds come out and subtitles appear at the bottom of the screen when they weren't there before. The first time it happened, I was sure it was a strange glitch, but it happened again and again and again. Honestly, the game should have abandoned voice acting altogether because the performances that do exist consist of stilted and soporific line readings that make off-Broadway theater feel like Laurence Olivier doing Shakespeare at the Globe. There's a pirate you meet early in the game that I'm still convinced recorded his lines while hung over or half asleep. Audio glitches abound in regular play, too, with sounds fading in and out of existence seemingly at random, giving Raven's Cry the unintentional sound design of a nightmarish Lynch-ian fever dream."", ""All of the other complaints that can be levied against Raven's Cry are legion, but you can force yourself to soldier through them if you really want to, although I pity anyone who voluntarily spends any time with this game. What truly puts Raven's Cry in the pantheon of the worst games of all time is that story progression can easily become totally impossible. After slugging through 17 hours of the game, a bug in a story portion of the game--where there was only one way back to the overworld out of the labyrinthine temple I'd been exploring--crashed my computer over and over again at the same point. I turned the game off, came back a couple of hours later, and tried again. The game crashed again. And I'd had enough."", ""It's not hard to say whether it's worse that Raven's Cry is so broken or that it's full of so much offensive material; the offensive material is worse. But the fact is that either of these things is more than enough for a rational person to avoid playing it. The game is unfinished, a chore when you can play it, and full of disgusting vitriol aimed at women and people of color. Buy a ticket for a different ship.""]"Kevin VanOrd,8-Feb-15,Evolve Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/evolve-review/1900-6416026/,8,PC & Xbox One & PS4,"['Like many children, I was afraid of the mythical monster under the bed, but in time, this nightmare fodder gained a face and a name. It was the Sasquatch, a creature I came to fear when watching a cheap television film late at night which demonized the fictitious (or is it?!) beast. I refused to go into the woods by myself for years afterwards, for fear a giant hairy fiend might grab me and abscond with my limp body, for Lord knows what reasons. By avoiding the woods, I could avoid the monster lurking there.', 'Evolve doesnt let you hide. This unusual and entertaining team-focused shooter forces you to face a grotesque monster in each and every match, and should you find it, you cannot always flee. Heres the setup: a four-person team of hunters, each touting very specific talents, is on the prowl. The quarry is a single creature with an appetite for flesh. Not just the flesh of the hunters, but indeed, for the flesh of anything that moves. By attacking the wildlife and chomping down on its meat, the monster evolves through three stages of being, each more powerful than the last. Clearly, the hunters would rather tear the monster down with the least resistance possible, and thus finding the creature quickly, and efficiently destroying it, is a good teams opening goal.', 'Would that it were so easy. Should you join a team of hunters, you rely on a particular squadmate to lead you to the beast. That would be the trapper, and while you eventually unlock two other trappers to chose from, Evolve smartly taps Maggie as the initial leader. Maggie makes for a good guide through the ins and outs of pursuit, for she is not a lone ranger. Instead, she relies on her best friend Daisy, an animal called a trapjaw that you might think of as an ugly beagle, or perhaps the result of a hyena and a sharks unholy coupling. In any case, Daisy is truly womans best friend: she follows the monsters tracks, and leads you to its current location, should all the proper pieces fit in place.', ""I describe the trapper first because she is the de facto team leader. Trappers Abe and Griffin have their own tracking tools--a pistol that shoots tracking darts, in Abes case, and sonic spikes that alert you to the monsters whereabouts for Griffin. Yet Maggie and Daisy are crucial in those early learning hours, and if they join your team frequently, your first match without Daisy feels rather lonely, as if youve lost a buddy and have been forced to fend for yourself under duress. With or without her, this phase captures the essence of a true hunt: its tense, simmering with the possibility of a sighting at any moment, and, like a real-life hunting trip (or Sasquatch search, depending on your predilections), there might be stretches of boredom. A sneaky monster crouches to hide its tracks, or doubles back on its own path, thus leaving a befuddling set of paw prints. Even with a veteran crew, Evolve is occasionally the Blair Witch Project of online shooters, replete with creepy noises, signs of a deadly presence, and a whole lot of running around, hoping for something to happen, at least in its central Hunt mode. How long it takes Evolve as a whole to become stale is difficult to gauge, but after close to three dozen hours, I'm not yet ready to leave it behind. If anything, I'm eager to discover more ways to use the landscape as part of my strategy, though I find this world a fascinating enough place that time outside of battle still engages me. If you prefer to run your engine hot, the hunt may not satisfy you."", 'The hunters chat it up from time to time, trying to keep you invested in the chase, but the dialogue repeats quickly and often. Hunting with my grandfather was as much about telling stories as it was about bagging an eight-point buck (we thankfully never encountered the Sasquatch); if only Evolve had taken the opportunity to regale you with tall tales. Nevertheless, Evolve goes out of its way to mitigate any potential tedium, forcing the monster to attack a power generator, and the hunters to defend it, once the monster achieves the final stage of its evolution. In any case, hunts dont usually hit the boredom breaking point. There is wildlife to contend with, for starters, though youll ignore most of the critters when possible. Yet you cant always bypass them, either because killing one rewards you with a temporary (but still long-lasting) buff, or because a not-actually-a-rock comes to life and starts chomping on your tasty bits. The world of Shear isnt hospitable, though humans have certainly tried to tame it, going so far as to build a verdant bird sanctuary on its most chilling map. Theres no story to speak of, but the poisonous creeks and carcasses left by the monsters predations speak volumes. The visual design deserves some credit for the oppressive atmosphere, bringing to life a planet that clearly isnt Earth, but is just enough like it to unsettle you--a biological uncanny valley, if you will. Audio wields the true power in Evolve, however, freaking you out with the chitter-chatter of Lord-knows-what, and the squishes and crunches of what-the-hell-made-that-noise...', 'And then the moment arrives, and the foreshadowed attack occurs. Battles remain fresh and exciting due to an in-game conspiracy devised by Evolves many variables: rising plateaus that provide vantage points and break up the line of sight; the trappers vast dome, which traps the monster within its confines and creates corners and cul de sacs; nearby creatures that might enter the fray; and the hunters own weapons and skills, of course, which damage and limit the monster in various ways. Assault expert Hyde uses toxic grenades that poison the monster and help drive it to different areas; support-class robot Bucket drops floating turrets that pelt the monster with bullets; and tracker Abe slows down the target with stasis grenades.', 'Audio wields the true power in Evolve, however, freaking you out with the chitter-chatter of Lord-knows-what.', 'These battles are invariably intense. There are three monsters in total--the ground-pounding Goliath, the airborne Kraken, and the Wraith, master of the hit-and-run. A Goliath skirmish is the most straightforward, typically: the brute attacks head on, throwing boulders and breathing fire, wreaking havoc on your health bar while dramatically tossing you and your comrades through the air. A fight like this can be beautifully disorienting when you find yourself thrown into the underbrush and your visibility is limited, or fall into a nearby river, wholly impotent until you can crawl out. Should you catch the monster early in its evolution, it might take flight, potentially instigating a game of cat-and-mouse as you attempt to trap it before it escapes--which it most often does. That doesnt mean, however, that Parnells rockets might not land a few good shots as it runs, and perhaps Goliath will frighten a flock of birds as it trudges away, alerting you to its current location.', 'A battle with the Kraken plays out differently, as this peculiar beast rises above you and spits down lightning, a cryptozoological Zeus punishing every hunter with zaps of electricity. The downside of facing the Kraken is that some weapons simply wont do; if Im playing as Hyde, I may never get close enough to the thing for my flamethrower to be effective. (Thank goodness for Hydes minigun, which spews forth an enormous string of ammo before needing to be reloaded.) Well, there are other downsides, of course--the possibility of your medic getting cornered and annihilated, and the Kraken zapping anyone that should mindlessly rush into harms way to revive her. Situational awareness wins and loses matches. As you become more experienced, you learn how to exploit Shears vertical spaces, using a jetpack to float to better locations, and putting obstacles between you and your flesh-eating stalker. The game warns you to stick with your team should you wander off too far, and few warnings in video games are so meaningful. There is no room for a chest-thumping supersoldier: Playing hero means your charred corpse shall become monster food.', 'If youd rather be the feaster than the feast-ee, youd best play as the monster yourself, and I confess there are few greater pleasures in Evolve than gulping down a fallen hunter as you would Shears grazing fauna. You can eat Daisy too, should she die during battle, though I have pangs of guilt when doing so. Shes such an innocent participant in the proceedings, and besides, shes cute in her own disgusting way. On the other hand, she needs to die: not only does she lead the hunters directly to me, but she also revives her teammates by licking them to full health. Might as well fill my belly with some Daisy-meat when the opportunity presents itself.', 'Indeed, playing as the monster is deliciously evil, particularly when choosing the Wraith, which can swoop in, grab a hunter, and rush away, depositing the target somewhere else in the vicinity. Presuming you buy only the basic Evolve release, and avoid collectors editions, season passes, and the like, you need to unlock the Wraith by playing Goliath, and then Kraken, and leveling up your profile appropriately. Fortunately, doing so is not too time-consuming, though given the limited choices of monsters and hunters, these gates seem unnecessary and unfortunate. (And, of course, they remind you that Evolve has plans for downloadable hunters and monsters that will surely cost you some cash.)', 'Monstering it up is just as fulfilling as engaging in the hunt, though the pace is different. You spend the early minutes sniffing out the wildlife and satiating your hunger, which not only reinforces your armor, but also brings you that much closer to evolving. You might be a hulking beast, but youre more vulnerable than you think, particularly at stages one and two. Smart play can yield victory even so, though youre best bet is to avoid confrontation until you are the brawniest bully you always knew you could be. Just as good hunters are constantly in motion, so too is a good monster, and in this way, the tables turn: the hunted becomes the hunter, and it is the four-person squad that has most to fear.', 'The tempo changes considerably when you abandon Hunt mode and experiment with other possibilities. There is Nest mode, for instance, in which the hunters must gun down a half-dozen monster eggs ready to be hatched before the monster annihilates the team. The monster, in turn, can hatch an egg to spawn a minion, which tears through the jungle en route to the pack of hunters. Even at stage one, following a minion into a warzone is incredibly tempting: not only does a duo do more damage, but the addition of another combatant can confuse the team. Rescue mode requires the hunters to revive fallen colonists and protect them while waiting for a dropship to appear and whisk the survivors away to safety, but it has something important in common with Nest mode: it uses specific objectives to keep both the hunters and the monster in motion, and brings them together early and often as a result.', 'A battle with the Kraken plays out differently, as this peculiar beast rises above you and spits down lightning.', 'Defend mode, meanwhile, takes its cues from battle arenas like League of Legends and Dota 2, tasking hunters with shielding generators while minions spawn onto the map at specified intervals and go on the attack. Taking the monsters reigns is rather like playing a Dota 2 hero: your minions are creeps, automatically hammering on targets and distracting the opposition so you might pounce, damage your enemies health and resolve, and steal away in order to grab a snack and replenish your armor. Its Evolves most action-packed mode, and as such, it is an appropriate finale for the games Evacuation mode, which combines five matches of varying modes into a single smorgasbord. The winner of each match gains a boon for the next--monster-targeting turrets might appear in various nooks, for instance, or a beam might occasionally appear from space, frying hunters that get caught within it.', 'Evolve apparently rebalances matches even as it adds these map gimmicks so that winning the first match does not initiate a five-match steamroll. Even so, its hard to tell whether the behind-the-scenes rebalancing properly matches the gimmick. Its profoundly irritating to deal with those turrets as a monster, for instance, because they might gun down wandering wildlife, and thus not only damage you if you creep too near, but overcomplicate the simple act of eating. Not every gameplay variant feels as fair as the last in any case, and while some map ploys usher in welcome diversity, others are mechanica non grata.', 'Its worth noting that Evolve supports bots, an all-too-uncommon feature, and while the AI reveals its imperfections as time goes on, its strong enough to make playing offline matches rewarding on its own terms, and bots will fill in for disconnected teammates, or will leap into action should you not be able to find a friend to take that particular role. As with Turtle Rocks Left 4 Dead, Evolve is best when you play with buddies; getting matched with a novice can lead to ghastly results if your newfound friend constantly seeks out the nonexistent I in team. It doesnt take long to whip a newcomer into shape, at least, meaning you can usually focus on Evolves unique brand of greatness: the suspense of the hunt, the exhilaration of battle, and the drive to dominate Shear. Even Sasquatch would shiver at the dangers.']"Tyler Hicks,6-Feb-15,#IDARB Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/idarb-review/1900-6416024/,8,Xbox One,"['You\'re at a basketball game. The two teams are neck and neck in the fourth quarter. Suddenly, the crowd starts chanting, ""Chum, chum, chum!"" Kevin Garnett steals the ball and makes a breakaway down the court, when suddenly a shark comes from underneath the floor to swallow him whole! While such an event will never happen in real life, it\'s a regular occurrence in the game of #IDARB, the crowd-sourced, minimalist platform arena ball game.', ""In #IDARB, your objective is to get the ball into the opponent's goal. The level is set up as a 2-D platform-based arena, and the only tools at your immediate disposal are the ability to move, jump, double-jump, shoot, and, in the case of playing in teams rather than 1v1, a pass option."", 'That may not sound like much, but it is all that #IDARB needs. The initial rush for the ball sets the pace of the game. You and your opponent dash and drop to get to the central platform. You\'ve grabbed the ball! Do you drop through the platform and try to ascend for an easy shot, or do you play footsie with your foe to try to slip past them as they attempt to swipe the ball from you? Ah, you\'ve managed to evade their attempts to steal! You\'re on a path to an easy lay-up! But there\'s that familiar pulsing sound of your opponent frantically spamming their ""shoot"" button to swat the ball away and deny you your easy points. The ball goes flying across the stage, and the two of you take off to reclaim possession.', ""Every moment of a #IDARB match is filled with energy because, at any second, you or your opponent could get the angle necessary to set yourself up for points. Of course, if the easy lay-ups aren't your style, the more challenging three- and five-point shots are there to fill the void. The level's design is deliberately put together to offer perfect angles for long-range shots so that, once you've learned them and added them to your arsenal, you've gained a new tool for your adversaries to fear."", ""The scoring system further enhances the competitive drama. Your opponent has taken the ball. He stops on the central platform and aims at the platform above him! He shoots. The ball bounces off the ceiling above him, then off a platform below ... and into the goal? Each bounce multiplies the shot's score by another factor. Fifteen points for a single shot! And you thought you were clever with that five-pointer from the bottom of the stage. You won't make that mistake again. As you face off for the ball rush again, you charge and activate your Fizzics, flying across the stage and barreling through the otherwise unpassable white platforms on a collision course with the the opposing goal. You miss, but the opponent foolishly waits below you. You jump downward, smashing his head and leaving him dizzy as you line up a three-pointer at the buzzer and take the round."", ""#IDARB's seemingly simple action is filled with depth and tons of trick shots to discover. The game also features social media integration into both Twitter and Twitch.TV stream channels that allow viewers or random passers-by to interfere with your game through commands called hashbombs. Muscle memory reigns supreme when a viewer drops the #light hashbomb and turns off the lights, leaving the illuminated ball and your player indicator triangle as the only clues to what's going on. Some hashbombs are more benign, such as a visit from Rick Astley or the transformation of the entire stage into a circus, with each player replaced by clowns. Others have drastic effects on the physics of the game, such as flooding the stage (with water OR beer!) or covering the stage in ice."", ""The single-player story mode of #IDARB is simple and does its job of introducing you to the game's features. Each stage is preceded by a short conversation with the AI opposition before you are set loose to play ball. Many of the conversations managed to elicit a chuckle or two from me, whether through silliness or dry humor. Your game escalates from a 1v1 starting point with no extra features to your being joined by a coffee mug and two other players as you take on 4v4s with randomly selected hashbombs interrupting your play. I personally never lost any of the matches, but I also felt like I wasn't the primary contributor to my victories. The coffee mug had several ounces of talent to slow-roast my opponents. Even if you aren't the leading scorer, however, the post-game victory screen allows you to waggle your right thumbstick to raise your victory pedestal and claim Most Valuable Player status."", ' ', ""If you have a gambling itch that needs scratching without bleeding actual money, the game features a fantasy mode where two AI-controlled teams face off against one another, allowing you or any of your Twitch viewers to bet on the teams, as well as drop hashbombs to attempt to influence the game in your favor. I found myself frustrated with this particular feature, but only because Murphy's Law insisted on bankrupting me every time I attempted to bet on a team."", ""Online play allows you to host and invite anyone from your friend list for a 1v1 match-up or hop into matchmaking with one to four players on your console to face off against an equal number of online opponents. Unfortunately, you cannot invite an Xbox Live friend to join your team as you queue up for matchmaking, so you're stuck only with friends you've acquired in person if you wish to play anything other than 1v1 online. The matchmaking process is fast, though no skill differentiation exists to ensure that your opponent will be able to keep up with your mad skills. Additionally, laggy games occur from time to time (especially when matched against opponents overseas or across the continent), and rather than one person being slightly desynchronized and having to compensate for latency, the game ensures that players are synchronized in every frame, causing the game to play in slow motion. These hiccups are mostly minor stumbling blocks and don't regularly interrupt the ability to take the game's good time online across the globe, but they are still worth noting."", 'Every moment of a #IDARB match is filled with energy.', ""The pixilated characters are divided amongst customizable teams, such as the standard Red and Blue teams, as well as the story mode opponents such as the Moustache Cops, Your Moms, the Barbarian Horde, Old McDonalds farm (and their later forms, Breakfast). Other pop culture teams have found their way into the game as well, such as 8-Bit Halo characters, Retro City Rampage, Intellivision, and my personal favorite, the entire roster of Iron Galaxy's Divekick."", ""Players may edit character appearances or even create their own characters, which can then be shared through QR codes--take a picture of the QR code on your phone, and then use the Xbox One's Kinect to scan the code. Beyond just characters, players may make team logos and even team theme songs with up to four layers of a variety of instruments. Occasionally, you encounter player-created characters in matchmaking. Don't be surprised by the Internet, however, as you get matched against literal piles of poo and phallic drawings from time to time. The realm of possibilities is expansive, and anyone who seeks to do so can make a personalized impact on the game through the game's creative tools, leaving a fallback should one ever start to find the gameplay repetitive."", ""For me, the game's thrilling competition is more than enough to earn the stamp of approval. #IDARB doesn't look like much, but it brings a feast to the table. It stands as proof that all it takes to make a fantastic game, even with today's available technology, is a solid set of core gameplay mechanics with inherent depth."", ' ']"Daniel Starkey,6-Feb-15,Apotheon Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/apotheon-review/1900-6416025/,8,PC,"['Playing Apotheon is like being an archaeologist exploring and unearthing the mysteries of an unknown world. You find your hands stretching thousands of years back in time to discover a story you didnt know had unfolded. The art is immediately distinctive. While the same could be said for a fair number of independent games, this time its more than just a pretty background. Like the ochre-stained walls of an Athenian temple circa 500 BC, Apotheons characters are little more than black silhouettes. The environments are elaborate, sprawling, two-dimensional cutaways. They beg you to imagine this wondrous world in its full glory, but they resist conventional beauty.', ""These paintings are all we have left. Beneath that veneer is a run-of-the-mill action platformer. You make a few jumps here, and fight a few baddies there. Throughout, the minute-to-minute play stays simple. You grab weapons and shields lying around, using one button to attack, one to block, one to jump, and the two sticks to move about and aim your strikes with added precision. There's a basic crafting system as well, but it's a straightforward one. Instead, Apotheon expounds on these basic ideas with a string of apropos twists. When venturing into the underworld, for example, you often have to give up the use of a shield to navigate by torchlight, unless you've found a shield kept by the servants of the sun god, Apollo, that can light your path. Each area has something unique to uncover that make some parts of your journey harder, others easier. Such flourishes greatly add to Apotheons character, and support the game's mythological inspirations."", 'Our hero in this neo-Classical myth is Nikandreos. While not a member of the traditional Greek pantheon, his epic sticks to the conventions of Classical tragedy. In the prelude, his hometown, Dion, is out of favor with the gods. The forests have no game, the fields yield no crops, and the sky is stuck in perpetual twilight. Nikandreos, seeking to restore the mantle of humanity, journeys to Mt. Olympus, the realm of the deities. There he learns that Zeus, king of the gods, has grown to hate people and will not rest until they are destroyed.', 'If that sounds cliched, thats because, from a modern lens, it is. Apotheon eschews modern expectations, reflecting a far older brand of storytelling. Greek tragedy, and Greek heroes in particular, are far different from the super-powered defenders of good we see today. Greek heroes were flawed, difficult people who accomplished great things, though were often cruel and awful as well. Classical tragedy is even more unusual. These stories draw on themes such as the conflict between men and gods, and depict arrogant heroes that unravel themselves with acts of great hubris.', 'The ancients were a scared, superstitious people. We frequently forget their struggles, remembering them instead as creators of grand, monolithic civilizations. We forget these people believed not only in divine providence, but also in retribution. We forget the limits of their understanding, and that for these classic civilizations catastrophe was evidence of the wrath of the gods. From that perspective, Apotheon is hauntingly poignant.', 'In his quest for salvation, Nikandreos partners with Hera, queen of the gods. Shes been brewing over her husbands many affairs and now lusts for justice. She guides Nikandreos, pointing out to him the weaknesses of the mighty Olympians. At every turn, figures from Greek myth appear--each with their own grudges, their own motives--to help Nikandreos. As he gathers power, he leaves nothing but death and destruction in his wake. Between each act, he sees that his people are suffering and dying--punished for his own arrogance. However, he, or rather we, never once waver. On we march to claim our prize, and to topple the gods.', 'This drama works because its relatable. At some point, every person who has ever lived has experienced pain. Suffering is a fundamental human experience. When were at our worst, we seek relief, no matter how destructive it may prove to be. The gods arent much different. Hera is driven by her lust for revenge, Zeus by his disappointment in his people. The other gods and goddesses you meet have their own motives, their own goals, and a slew of victims that want you to succeed. You become the vessel for hope, relief, and peace, your only failure being that youre so damned foolhardy that you cant see the consequences of your actions.', 'Apotheon shares many of its narrative threads with God of War, but the differences pile up quickly. Where God of War sticks to video game tropes, Apotheon is content to ground itself in myth. This is a fantastical world where gods and goddesses roam the earth, but beyond that, theres no need for the suspension of disbelief. Where God of War is flashy and bombastic, Apotheon is soft and personal. Every battle is slow and careful. Each hit is quite damaging, so you hold your shield up and bide your time for a perfect strike.', 'Apotheon eschews modern expectations, reflecting a far older brand of storytelling.', 'Your weapons and shields also have limited durability. At best, a spear lasts you a few small battles. There are no flaming chain blades here. Instead, you have a small assortment of conventional blades, axes, and pikes. Shields can cover only a limited part of your body so you also have to predict the direction of incoming strikes. Its similar to a two-dimensional Dark Souls in that respect. Unfortunately, that lack of depth is one of the few knocks against Apotheon. Repeating the block-wait-attack tactic for ten hours gets thin. The only respite is the bouts with the gods themselves.', 'Each deity has an individual domain with its own rules and challenges. Artemis, the goddess of the hunt, for example, transmutes you into a deer and try to lay traps to kill you. To best Athena, goddess of wisdom, you must navigate three concentric, rotating labyrinths. These contests serve two purposes. They reinforce your smallness and their godhood, and add variety to an otherwise monotonous trek.', 'My time with Apotheon reminded me of a conversation from the film Prometheus. David, an android, discusses with Charlie, a human, the relationship of creators and creation. David asks Charlie why people created robots. The response, We made you because we could, upsets David. Can you imagine how disappointing it would be for you to hear the same thing from your creator?', 'Apotheon asks these same kinds of questions. Zeus, consumed with regret for how petty mankind has become, wants to unmake us. Nikandreos, having observed the same pettiness in other Olympian gods, conquers them and creates a new world where he is god. The names Apotheon and Nikandreos both allude to this chain of events, meaning one who is elevated to godhood and victorious man, respectively. Victory, and even deification then, are fated from the beginning. You will win. You are the hero, after all, but I can only wonder if in time his creation will bring him relief or despair.']"Nick Capozzoli,6-Feb-15,Elite: Dangerous Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elite-dangerous-review/1900-6416023/,7,PC,"[""I am skillfully piloting my Zorgon Peterson brand Hauler through the rotating port of one of the eighty bazillion space stations in Elite: Dangerous. I fiddle with system checks on the holographic dashboard, wearing an expression of self-satisfied disinterest. Almost casually, I flip on the landing gear, invert my ship, and reverse thrusters, deftly drifting into landing pad number 44. I'm master and commander at the far side of the galaxy. I'm an ace. I'm the Star Lord. I'm...not docking?"", 'Well. In a Whedonesque bit of bathos, Elite: Dangerous has glitched, and instead of the chirps of the landing guidance system, I\'m being rewarded with the angry, electric snapping sound of my shields grinding on raw space station. No problem--I\'ll just cancel my docking request and resend it. I make the requisite clicks. And that\'s when things go very, very bad. ""TRESPASS WARNING"" flashes in deadly red text, and a timer begins counting down from thirty. ""Loitering is a crime punishable by death,"" a female voice helpfully intones over a loudspeaker, as I\'m perforated by what is, frankly, an irresponsible amount of laser fire from station security. End scene.', ""Lasers, explosions, dystopian public service announcements...that was one of my more dramatic deaths in Elite: Dangerous, but it's actually in the routine of the parts preceding my demise that I experienced the quintessential sci-fi experience. It's the genre's unique thrill: seeing the incredible trappings of futuristic life fade into the background, turn second nature, become mundane. It's Chris Pratt punting alien lizards while dancing along to a cassette, or the way Cowboy Bebop segues from interstellar gateways to bell peppers and beef. The science is still there, of course, doing all the work to keep the cold void of space safely on the other side of the glass. But all the fussy details have been neatly elided, the edges gently worn and rounded from use. That's my kind of sci-fi, and Elite: Dangerous often delivers it, like a spacefaring Euro Truck Simulator."", 'But in Elite, that sort of familiarity is hard-won. Even if you do your due diligence in the game\'s tutorial--tampering with the controls, pitching and rolling until you can parallel park at half the speed of light--the game\'s vision of spaceflight simulation still proves aloof. It\'s quite a thing, to dump a player into a scale representation of the entire Milky Way galaxy with only the vaguest hint of direction. There\'s no expressed goal in Elite: Dangerous; if you\'re looking for signs of progress they might be found in your reputation, a one-word descriptor ranging from ""Harmless"" to ""Elite."" But you could just as easily mark your improvement by the accrual of bigger and better ships, or in cold hard credits. A few intersecting occupations are accounted for: trader or smuggler, pirate or bounty hunter... and miner for those who prefer the company of floating bits of rock.', 'You have the freedom to go where you will and do what you want, but friction and false starts ensure that you won\'t be going there very fast or doing it very efficiently for some time. There\'s the inscrutability of your cockpit dashboard to contend with, loaded for bear with functionality that never gets articulated. That, and the imposing galaxy map, with its disorienting scale and legion of similar-sounding star systems. There are the glitches, like the time I spawned into the game to find a shiny new ""Wanted"" label I\'d earned for no reason, or the aforementioned docking snafu. And there\'s all the missing data that can only be found outside of the game, from critical trade information to a plain-words explanation of how your ship\'s fuel tank actually works.', ""It wasn't until I totalled the shiny new spacecraft I'd been loaned and tried to make a go of it with the chintzy, standard-issue Sidewinder that I came to better grasp Elite's systems. The Sidewinder's rinky-dink frame shift drive forced me to take a more considered look at the galaxy map or risk leaving myself stranded between long system jumps. The absence of a docking computer meant that I'd be guiding the little craft into station on manual instead having the autopilot unceremoniously dump me onto landing pads. Elite is at its best when its forcing this more deliberate level of engagement, and I wish it happened more often. Tellingly, there's a pre-flight systems checklist that you can run through every time you take off, but Elite pulls its punch and lets you opt out. Even as I write this, I'm hurtling through space on a trade run at 16.64c, window minimized. It's perfectly possible, as it turns out, to conduct an intragalactic smuggling operation en passant. All that's necessary is the occasional alt + tab to make sure I'm not about to plow headlong into a star."", 'Once you\'ve gotten your space legs under you and upgraded to something resembling a viable ship, it\'s easy to settle into semi-comfortable routine. Check the station bulletin board for courier missions or a tantalizing bounty payout, or the commodities market for a decent-looking buy-low option. Set a course, leapfrogging from star to nearby star. Arrive at your destination system, drop out of hyperspace and into a slightly slower supercruise, and throttle down so that you don\'t overshoot the beacon for your target station or combat zone. Deliver your supplies, ply your wares, blow up your mark, and repeat. Profits can be reinvested in your ship once you\'re safely docked, towards upgraded cargo holds or, say, advanced lasers. The nuances of kitting out a good ship are as obscure as any of the rest of Elite\'s systems, but generously, anything bought can be sold back for the same price if it turns out you\'ve made a colossal error. Elite is less charitable when it comes to trading outside the garage. The game plays it coy when you look for trade data in other star systems--the best you can hope for is a suggestion that ""maybe"" a given product is ""sometimes"" exported from some station therein. Often times it isn\'t there, however, and let me tell you: there\'s a real novel frustration in traveling eighty light years away to find out they\'re all out of tea this week.', ""You have the freedom to go where you will and do what you want, but friction and false starts ensure that you won't be going there very fast or doing it very efficiently for some time."", ""Its enough to drive a fellow to tea piracy, which happens to be well accommodated for in Elite's laissez-faire frontier. One can buy interdiction systems that forcibly drag an NPC or a player character's ship out of supercruise, opening them up to predation should they fail a minigame of keep the crosshairs aligned. Thus engaged, combat unfolds with straightforward but precise dogfights, where momentum and trajectory are the secret killers, not the missiles or lasers. I confess that Im not particularly good at this sector of Elite, whether it comes to gauging an enemys skill from afar, or sticking to his six in the heat of battle. I even have trouble remembering to keep my speed at the sweet spot that lets you turn quickest. But a more practiced hand can make use of the more advanced tactical offerings, redistributing power to the parts of one's ship in the most need, or pulling the slick-looking maneuvers conferred by a stick and throttle system or Oculus VR headset (the peripherals pair so naturally with Elite that the game almost seems built just to leverage them). That's a wrinkle I've yet to master, but the promise of dramatic, large-scale battles between federal armadas tucked away in distant systems is more than enough incentive to learn the ropes. Would that you could effectively team up with other players to run them--Elites tools for inter-player cooperation are almost nonexistent."", ""The little joys of Elite: Dangerous' solo play suffice, though. Peals of thunder rumble past your ship in supercruise, and I dont care if they're as fake as the pumped-in crowd noise at the Georgia Dome, because they sound great. Ditto for the sudden, 18-wheeler horn that accompanies a drop out of hyperspace into close proximity with a giant, iridescent star. The hottest of these visibly cook your ship if you get too close, which happens to be a requirement if you want to use a fuel scoop to replenish your stores on the fly. They're also functional light emitters in the game's engine, and you can see the shadow of your craft ripple down the side of a station if you get between the two bodies. There are a few curiosities out in the ether, too, though theyre harder to appreciate if youre not an astrophysics hobbyist. For example, the chance discovery of a station orbiting, well, nothing, struck me as odd. Theres a term for this, apparently: a LaGrange Point, but instead of making me contemplate the wonder of the universe, it mostly brought ZZ Top to mind. Still, this a game where light years can be hopped in a moment, and yet the prospect of traveling from one end of Elite's map to the other remains inconceivable. It's hard to overstate how remarkable that is, how the simple act of playing a game can engender such an acute awareness of size and scale."", 'It\'s an accomplishment in its own right, but that breadth doesn\'t come into play elsewhere in the experience. Like most space sims, Elite: Dangerous partitions the universe into discreet ""rooms,"" in this case representing individual star systems. At a glance, it appears that almost a third of these systems purport to be in open rebellion, though you\'d never know it from the pervasive quiet. Slaves are purchasable and tradable commodities, an inclusion that\'s sometimes played for ironic humor in the missions but usually rings as off-putting. The only way to interact with that underbelly of rebellion and slavery is from the comfort of my captain\'s chair, through a market speculation interface or a salvo of missiles. I pick up contracts for the assassination of high-ranking government officials on the same screen that I get my tea delivery requests.', ""The old problem remains: when time and distance are bumped out to these impossible ranges, the only systems capable of following them out there are the most discreet and elastic ones. Trade just happens to scale well, a daisy chain of supply to demand, demand to supply, all the way to the white nothing at the edge of the universe. Perhaps the next true frontier is the search for a procedural generation system that can create something more ostentatious, something that can surprise...something not so visibly derived from an underlying system of ones and zeroes. But then, maybe it's there in Elite: Dangerous, in its way, and the problem is that I need to learn to start being more impressed by LaGrange points.""]"Alexa Ray Corriea,4-Feb-15,The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-legend-of-zelda-majora-s-mask-3d-review/1900-6416013/,9,3DS,"[""It's hard not to compare The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 3D to Nintendo's other foray into handheld Zelda remakes, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D. Ocarina of Time's upgrades for the 3DS significantly improved the experience; artfully placed Sheikah Stones offered visions and showed where and how to solve the next puzzle, and the 3DS's gyroscope added motion controls to certain actions, such as shooting arrows. These additions were designed to make the game accessible to modern audiences and more palatable for short play sessions."", ""For 3DS, Majora's Mask was retooled to be friendlier in shorter player sessions, with great success. A more detailed quest log lets you keep track of every completed, uncompleted, and rumored item on your to-do list. You can set alarms to remind you when certain events will occur. Small tweaks to how songs affect time and the flow of boss battles give you deeper control of time itself, while the rearrangement of collectible items throughout dungeons and the overworld make Majora's Mask feel fresh for those coming back after 15 years."", ""Majora's Mask is inarguably the weirdest Legend of Zelda game. Sometime shortly after the events of Ocarina of Time, our hero Link wanders into a country called Termina. Hyrule it is not: The ominously named region is home to an eerie cast of characters and hosts an inordinate number of strange happenings. An erratic mask salesman hoarding cursed objects? We've got one. Alien abductions? Frequent. Ghost hands in toilets and ghost giants throwing boulders and ghosts doing tai chi on huge mushrooms? More common that you'd like."", ""The strangest happening is the grimacing moon falling out of the sky. Link is given 72 hours to find Skull Kid, an impetuous young creature, and steal back an item of terrible power, the titular Majora's Mask. To do so, Link must liberate four spirits located in four temples scattered throughout the world. These spirits can help save the world, but for now, they have also fallen prey to the bizarre magic clouding Termina. He only has three days to do it, but with the help of his trusty magic ocarina, Link can rewind time for those three days and live them over and over like some Groundhog Day redux."", ""Time management is the name of the game here. Anytime during the 72-hour window, you can play the Song of Time to rewind back to dawn of the first day. Having this limit means you must allot yourself ample time to clear regional quests and complete dungeons. In each area, what you do in the surrounding area directly affects your access to the dungeon and side quests, so you'll need those full 72 hours. In one region the town is iced over, and defeating the dungeon boss is the only way to restore spring. In spring you have access to a handful of smaller missions that in turn reveal more major gains, like upping your sword power and finding your long-lost horse. Once, I completed this dungeon and then immediately rewound back to the first day...only to find it all frozen again. It's this kind of thing you need to be mindful of as you play Majora's Mask, and forces you to forgo leisurely exploration in favoring of beelining between quest points."", 'Like in most Legend of Zelda games, extensive travel across the continent and back is required to collect special items. These items range from a bigger bag to carry your bombs to a bow and arrows and everything in between. The traditional Zelda gear accumulation formula is present: help NPCs to gain helpful combat items, complete dungeons to get useful items like the aforementioned bow and fire arrows, and beat the dungeon boss to collect a key item.', ""But other than mystical weapons and keys to defeating the game's ultimate enemy--the power of Majora's Mask--you're also on the hunt for masks. Masks do many special things, and, more often than not, donning one can solve a difficult problem. A Blast Mask allows you to explode an enemy or rock wall without using bombs. The Great Fairy mask attracts stray fairies to you, making them easier to collect. Another mask teaches people to dance, another charms animals into parading around after you, and yet another lets you run faster and jump longer. Still more transform you into other Termina races. The Deku Mask turns you into a Deku Scrub and lets you utilize cannon-like flowers and glide through the air, while the Goron Mask grants you powerful punching abilities and the race's stony look. Masks grant you situational powers and are the key to navigating most puzzles. The variety and versatility make it hard to resist taking time to collect them all, especially when you know they'll make life in Termina easier."", ""When you're not exploring the overworld, running fetch-quests for various townsfolk and mask hunting, you're in dungeons. Majora's Mask features four main dungeons and a handful of mini-dungeons where you can collect rare items like bigger wallets and mystical Zora eggs. Dungeons are the same as they've always been in Zelda: make your way through a labyrinthine, multi-level temple solving environment puzzles to get to the final boss. Defeating this final boss yields a health upgrade and liberates one of the four spirits that can help stop the moon from falling. Puzzles make up the meat of dungeon content, but you still spend an awful lot of time fighting."", ""Combat in Majora's Mask is simple. You use the left analog stick and face buttons to stab, slash, and parry, while the shoulder buttons help you block with your shield and lock on to enemies. The ability to lock on to enemies is helpful, as some opponents can crawl up onto the ceiling or leap long lengths, and keeping track of them becomes tricky."", ""Boss battles in Majora's Mask 3D have been substantially fixed, and while they feel more manageable than they did in the Nintendo 64 version, they aren't necessarily easier. These fights have been adjusted to prevent you from exploiting the boss's attack pattern, meaning that they won't always do the same thing with the same regularity in the same way. You need to knock bosses over and then attack their weak spots three times before you're victorious, but this time around, it's harder to sneak in cheap hits when they don't follow the same attack, rinse, and repeat formula. It makes these long fights feel new and interesting and makes success more satisfying. For example, the first dungeon boss can summon waves of smaller critters. The first time this happened, it was a handful of beetles. I expected him to go back to attacking me without his minions, but half a minute later, I had beetles and moths to contend with. Then he went back to attacking me solo until the end of the fight."", ""While bosses haven't been made easier, some other areas have been. There are more save points throughout the world, mercifully saving you from long stretches of lost progress in the event you fail. The Song of Soaring allows you to teleport to any save point, and now there are more of them to make navigation easier. Additionally, the Song of Double Time lets you fast forward to whatever hour you choose within a same-day window. In the original game, this song only let you fast-forward to dawn or dusk; in the 3DS version, you can teleport to any hour on the hour, allowing you to more carefully manage how and when you complete tasks. This also comes in handy when you just want to quickly wrap up a few side quests before rewinding to the first day and tackling a dungeon."", ""Even smaller changes make Majora's Mask 3D more digestible in small quantities and make the puzzles feel newer for repeat players. Scattered throughout each dungeon are a dozen or so stray fairies that can be returned to the region's Great Fairy for combat upgrades. These stray fairy locations have been changed up from the original game, so if you think you know where all fairies are going in, you'll likely be hunting a little harder. Some exits put you into areas closer to where you need to go, eliminating running time. For example, after collecting beans underground, I was dumped outside a platform I needed rather than the front of the temple, eliminating a minute of wandering."", ""But by far the best changes to Majora's Mask are the more detailed and comprehensive Bomber's Notebooks. These notebooks serve as your quest log, helping you keep track of where you should go and what you should be on the lookout for. The original Majora's Mask Notebooks were a little more cryptic and made you sweat out finding solutions a little more. Now, for the 3DS version, literally everything you need to know is there with a button press. The Notebooks keep track of rumors you hear from NPCs and gently suggest where you need to be to complete a task. Successful and failed tasks are also recorded, so if you mess something up on day three, you can rewind to day one and keep better track of how to fix it. These tiny tweaks make the game friendly in small doses. By giving players quick, efficient ways to tackle one sidequest or a mini-dungeon, they've ensured that they'll be comfortable playing the game in short bursts. Lunch breaks and morning commutes can now safely yield a fully completed Majora's Mask task."", ""The new Notebooks also keep track of the specific day and time that certain events occur and let you set alarms for them, so wherever you are in Termina, you'll know when you need to be back in Clocktown to catch a ghost or some extra cash. This is an amazing addition that makes housekeeping more manageable and lets you keep track of what items you get and when without having to take written notes yourself. Games with Majora's kind of time-management mechanics would do well to steal this gem of an idea."", ""In Majora's Mask, you have a set number of spaces to equip items and masks, and you're always swapping them around. Having the 3DS bottom screen show your gear and items at all times is an indispensable addition. You can fluidly explode a wall, attract a stray fairy, and then turn into a Deku Scrub and jump into a flower in a hot moment. It's convenient in every way that the original version was tedious. So many different items are needed at any given time, and having them all a tap away saves frustration and, more importantly, in-game time."", ""Majora's Mask 3D runs just fine on older 3DS models, but the experience is much more improved and cozy on the latest version, the New Nintendo 3DS. The additional tiny C-stick on the right side allows you to change the camera angle at will. This helps the most in boss fights, where both you and the boss are in constant motion, and it's often hard to keep track of where you both are. It also makes navigating large spaces while riding Epona much easier. In one quest, I had to ride around a wide expanse of farmland shooting aliens, and being able to shift where I was looking while riding at breakneck speed made fending them off a breeze."", ""If you're playing on the old 3DS, you have to lock Link in place and look around with the circle pad or use the gyroscope feature, which can get clunky. It's also frustrating for tasks that require you to move and look around quickly. Boss fights become equally annoying because lock-on targeting becomes the only way to keep tabs on the opposing monster. So while you can use your older 3DS with Majora's Mask 3D, I would highly recommend giving it a go on the newest handheld model."", ""The overall package for Majora's Mask 3D preserves all the weird delight of the original game while lowering the barrier of entry for new players. There's still a lot that's challenging about the puzzles and fights, but a few minor tweaks make your hard-won heart containers and masks feel that much more satisfying. The changes to how you can control and manage time mean the otherwise dense Majora's Mask is comfortable for shorter play sessions, making it a great fit for the handheld. It's evident that Nintendo put a lot of thought into updating this classic, which takes the game beyond a simple remake to become a new-old classic.""]"Alexa Ray Corriea,2-Feb-15,Game of Thrones: A Telltale Games Series Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/game-of-thrones-episode-two-the-lost-lords-review/1900-6416020/,8,PC,"[""Author George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire opens with a densely packed prologue. He gives you a taste of the world and its simmering dangers, a glimpse of attitudes in Westeros, and just enough information to get you wondering. It's a slow build-up to a dramatic payoff, and it takes a lot of patience and faith that things will get interesting before you get there. Telltale Games has taken this approach with its Game of Thrones video game, in that its second episode is where the story really begins. Having dedicated the entire first episode to setting the stage for the Forrester family's troubles, Telltale gets the ball rolling in Episode Two, The Lost Lords. The Forresters and their companions continue to be the most interesting characters on screen, and their ups and downs echo the flow of Martin's storytelling to great effect."", ""The Lost Lords opens on one of Episode One's more enigmatic lost ones, Asher Forrester, second-eldest son of the house and currently exiled in Yunkai. Yunkai, as you know, is Daenerys Targaryen's current pit-stop on her march to reclaim the Iron Throne. Meanwhile, Mira is still trying to leverage the favors of Margaery Tyrell and Tyrion Lannister in her family's favor, as well as balancing her strained friendship with another handmaiden. Gared Tuttle has just reached the Wall and is preparing to take the Black, joining the ranks of the Watchers that guard Westeros's northern border. And the situation at Ironrath continues to worsen, with the death of one lord and the unexpected arrival of another."", ""The first episode focuses entirely on the Forrester family, while The Lost Lords introduces others connected to them. We see two young women from other Northern houses come to comfort the grieving clan. In King's Landing, Mira's fellow handmaiden, Sera, is revealed as more than just an airheaded girl with dreams of marrying up. And in Yunkai, Asher hunts former slave-lords with his best friend, a female sellsword named Beskha."", ""Beskha is the most vivid of the new original characters, a boisterous, dirty-talking gal clad in leather who easily jokes about whores and who bounties with Asher. She's a strong addition to an already strong cast and is somewhat reminiscent of canon character Brienne of Tarth-- tall, muscular, brave, but with her own pack of secrets. During my time with The Lost Lords I latched onto Beskha, who felt like she had been hiding in dark corners of Westeros all along as we watched Daenerys and her retinue march on Yunkai."", ""Some of Episode Twos best moments take place at the beginning, and it's hard to describe how profoundly they affect the overall plot without giving too much away. If you're familiar with Martin's literary tricks--such as writing deaths of those gone for good, only from another character's perspective--you may have picked up their presence in Episode One, but in this episode they're more pronounced. The events in this episode's first two scenes feel like they were pulled directly out of the books or television show."", ""That's not where the familiarity stops, either. The Lost Lords feels like a piece straight from the source material and more intimately connected to the Game of Thrones universe than Iron from Ice. Granted, Iron from Ice was mostly scene-setting: who's dead, who's alive, whos unaccounted for but still not out of the game. Iron from Ice was the vehicle that got every character where they needed to be. Now, things become interesting. The Lost Lords is your reward for this long set-up, and not only is it well worth the wait, but it's worth several replays if you're the kind of person who needs to know the outcome of all choices on the table."", ""As with the previous episode and other Telltale titles, combat requires the same string of quicktime prompts in order to dodge swords, stab opponents, and duck under flying furniture. The first combat sequence in The Lost Lords one-ups the intro to Iron from Ice, presenting a close-quarters scuffle bloodier and more acrobatic than anything thus far. It's intimate, violent and just so Game of Thrones, it sent a chill down my spine. This episode's action sequences also move a little more quickly, which can cause you to die more quickly. However, the game autosaves every few moves and plunks you into the action with little progress lost, forgiving mistakes more easily and minimizing grievances."", ""There are a few light sequences in which you have Gared training for a spot on the Night's Watch. You have to carry barrels across a yard, perform some basic sword moves against another trainee, and shoot straw dummies with arrows. It's a brief string of moments that bring you into the fold of black cloaks and justify Jon Snow's presence, and, while it's pleasant within Gared's story arc, it feels shoehorned in when you look at the broader scope of things. It's not as dire as choosing whether or not to dispose of a murder weapon or bully someone into marrying you, and creates a bit of a lull in the middle of an otherwise high-energy episode."", 'Telltale\'s games present the possibility of your choosing your own route through a story, with each choice impacting events further out. In Game of Thrones, you don\'t just have one way to steer; there are nearly half a dozen wheels spinning at once that need to be accounted for. And each spinning wheel affects the other without knowing the others\' situation. Playing as the Forresters is a long game of telephone in which no one actually talks and all parties must consider each other at all times. The politics in Game of Thrones is incredibly stressful, and the scenarios produce the same feeling as episodes from the HBO show like ""The Mountain and the Viper"" and ""Blackwater."" Things have also started getting really scummy. The game nails the idea of backstabbing lords and unsuspecting servants in King\'s Landing, capturing the same urgency and dismay we\'ve come to expect from something carrying ""Game of Thrones"" in the title.', ""Normally, having so many things to keep track of in a video game is somewhat irritating, such as having to keep track of too many sidequests and remembering what NPCs need what item and when. Yet, Game of Thrones makes the act of forgetting what you did with one character not frustrating, but agonizing in the most entertaining way. Early on in the episode, I had an opportunity to forge a letter to someone that would greatly affect an outside union with House Forrester. I chose to write the letter, but by an hour later had completely forgotten about it, until someone suddenly brought it up. The letter-receiver and the member of my house they spoke to didn't know I had written the letter, taking the forged signature at face value. My first thought was how clever I had been. The second was that, oh my God, that act will probably destroy me later--both me and my house."", ""In Game of Thrones you're thinking for four people who, in turn, have to consider a dozen others in every decision they make. On a handful of occasions you have to choose whom to trust and whether or not to keep someone's confidence. Banking secrets may help you later, but breaking someone's faith may mean they throw you, literally, to the lions. Navigating conversations with some of the franchise's biggest characters like Tyrion and Jon Snow can be nerve-wracking, as these are the people in power you need to endear yourself to. But they are just the garnish on the proverbial cocktail Telltale has created with Game of Thrones' original characters."", ""The Lost Lords offers no respite from the anguish of Iron from Ice, and keeps the energy and intrigue up in surprising ways. It's evident every choice you make affects members of your far-flung family, and while it's strenuous to keep track of who is doing what so you don't screw over one of your relatives, it's the fact that your entire family's honor is hanging in the balance that really keeps you on your toes. And with very few opportunities to breathe and survey the damage in Episode Two, you often forget just how strongly your choices ripple out to your loved ones. It's genuinely tough trying to decide the best way out. Or the safest way. This is the real Game of Thrones.""]"Justin Clark,2-Feb-15,Citizens of Earth Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/citizens-of-earth-review/1900-6416019/,7,PlayStation Vita & PS4,"[""Stop me if you've heard this one: The vice president, his mom, his brother, and a conspiracy theorist walk into a forest. They get into a random encounter with a deer with a telephone attached to its antlers. The entire group gets hit with roaming charges."", 'Badumtiss.', 'Welcome to most of your time in Citizens of Earth, where state-of-the-art bad puns, visual gags, and Colbert Report-lite political jabs are the glue holding together a fun, accessible, 90s-throwback RPG. This is a delightful game about the newly elected and clueless vice president of Earth finding himself and his random collection of constituents fighting the evil, caffeinated influence of the Moonbucks Corporation all over the streets and underground lairs of Crystal City.', ""Citizens of Earth wears its influences proudly. The obvious joke to make is that the game's title stops just short of calling itself Citizens of Earthbound, which would be appropriate, but also not necessarily an insult, considering that the game shows an enormous amount of respect for its inspiration; and really, Earthbound's a game that doesn't get ripped off enough. The reality, however, is that there are equal parts Suikoden and Pokemon running through the game's DNA as well, spiked with a dose of sharp but good-natured Western snark. The game runs a master class on puns alone (personal favorite being a scene where you face down an enemy called the Puppet President, whos controlled by a literal Seat of Power), but it's not above the well-executed pop-culture reference (e.g., the ersatz Orkin lady who says Exterminate! in a Dalek voice) or taking a few gentle bites at politics in general. Citizens of Earth's commentary isn't exactly as scathing as your average Stewart/Colbert/Oliver diatribe, but it definitely takes its shots carefully and amusingly through its 20-odd hours. This is a game in which the VP, despite being the main character, never fights his own battles: with each fight, he literally hides behind omnipresent bushes, providing commentary and fretting over his perfect hair and teeth while the eponymous citizens do his dirty work. The dialogue is also solid, though the game gets strangely stingy with the voice acting after the first couple of hours, and seeing so many great one-liners float by as text-- as opposed to the great voice acting we get when each citizen is introduced--is a disappointment."", ""The game has far more reverence towards gameplay, however, and as mentioned, its influences are clear. From Suikoden, you get the sense of community, the concept of talking random characters from every corner of town;, and after performing a specific task--which could be anything from defeating a specific number of baddies, to completing some surprisingly frustrating Mario Party-esque minigames--you can invite these random characters to fight the good fight with you. There are about 40 of them to collect along the VP's journey, running the gamut from your own dear, sweet mother, who fights enemies with spankings and stat-lowering guilt trips, to computer programmers whose attacks hit (confusingly) in binary numbers. While some are much more useful than others, virtually any random job you might find in a small town is represented here, along with some sprinkles of pure wacky, like Conspiracy Guy and the local Ninja, and the sheer variety, the fun characterization, and lack of repetition among the wacky menagerie is fantastic, and addictive if only to mine all the new jokes out of the game."", 'Welcome to most of your time in Citizens of Earth, where state-of-the-art bad puns, visual gags, and Colbert Report-lite political jabs are the glue holding together a fun, accessible, 90s-throwback RPG.', ""The Pokemon comparisons come because, after recruitment, each character has to be trained up in order to take full use of their talents, some of which are useful both in and out of combat--like the Pilot, who can fly your party anywhere in the game world in seconds, or the Baker, who can make you delicious items without having to visit a store. As with Pokemon, all training requires is that characters be present during combat and they'll reap the XP benefits. It leads to the typical Pokemon situation of having to feed XP to underleveled characters to get them where they need to be. And afterward, you occasionally have situations like the Yoga Instructor or School Mascot, who provide such insane stat boosts per level that it almost feels like a cheat--but this is simply the double-edged sword that comes with being able to play the game in so many different ways."", ""From Earthbound, we get virtually everything else. CoE's graphics are much higher res and better drawn than Earthbound's 8-bit stylings, but the simplicity of CoE's Crystal City, how each area connects to the other, and the small-town feel of the place are familiar and functional. From merely walking down Main Street, to getting lost on Mount Pom Pom, it's simply a fun place just to wander in. And this is a feeling that doesn't go away the further you go, and the weirder the game gets. If there's a downside here, it's that the game's soundtrack is too nondescript for a game with so much character in every other respect."", ""Earthbound's combat system is almost copy-pasted here, right down to the trippy Hypnotoad backgrounds when fights start. You get a set of attacks--some basic, some costing energy orbs that replenish after a successful attack, and a few basic elemental strengths/weaknesses thrown in for good measure--and wail on enemies till they drop. The game has a nasty habit of making fights go on longer than they have to, because enemies will have transformations or defense moves that take multiple turns to compensate for, like the low-level walking java bean that transforms into a rabid, high-defense plant at the worst possible times. Citizens of Earth is a lot more forgiving, however, in that if your current character configuration isn't doing the trick fast enough, you can restart combat and swap out characters you don't need for that fight. Even if you die, you restart from the same spot on the map."", ' ', ""The game's biggest issue is that while the enemies are at least visible, they are legion, they start fights if they touch any of your characters onscreen, and they respawn the second you leave a room, even for a second. There's a neat trick where you can charge your characters at an enemy on the map who's got their back turned and kill them without even needing to fight, but the game gets finicky as to where some characters' backs are. It's frustrating at times, for sure, but there are so many ways to compensate that it's a wash."", ""Ultimately, the game is such an infinite fountain of charming and funny, that even when you've started rolling your eyes at how often you've had to wait for one of the traffic cone/hermit crab enemies to come out of defense, you end up getting into a conversation with an NPC and forgetting it ever happened. It's a fine slice of the 90s that developer Eden Industries has delivered here, and it's just too good being the Veep to let a few minor issues bring it down."", ' ']"Brett Todd,2-Feb-15,Grey Goo Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/grey-goo-review/1900-6416017/,8,PC,"['Retro in a good way. Modern-looking. And there you have Grey Goo, a back-to-the-future real-time strategy game from the Westwood veterans at Petroglyph. This is an impressive if deeply traditional game that is both a blast to play and a walk down memory lane for old timers who played Dune II and the first Command & Conquer in a time of parachute pants and high-waisted womens jeans. Like every good homage, though, Grey Goo does not feel old or derivative, even while it blatantly draws on the influences of its antique forebears and current genre giants like StarCraft II. Shrewd map and scenario design, beautiful visuals, aggressive artificial intelligence, and more combine to make for a very challenging experience, no matter if youre playing solo or multiplayer.', 'The sci-fi setting is a millennium or so into the future, a time when humanity has traveled into the stars and encountered two (apparently) alien races. The first is the Beta, a bipedal but vaguely insectoid (check out their nifty mandible-hand chest thingies) species that could have been ripped out of any one of a dozen old real-time-strategy affairs. But the second is the Grey Goo faction of the title, self-replicating nanobots that look like, well, piles of grey goo. The name comes from a well-known doomsday scenario wherein such microscopic machines run amok on Earth and consume the entire planet.', 'Unsurprisingly, these three species form the usual RTS triumvirate of factions. This trio is featured in a 15-mission campaign and four-player-max multiplayer/solo skirmishes on eight included maps, with three modes of play in Standard (destroy key enemy facilities), Annihilation (destroy all enemy facilities and units), and Destroy HQ (which should be self-explanatory). The game has been set up so that you must play through the campaign--which rolls out the Beta, then the Humans, then finally the Goo in five missions each--to learn enough about each faction to slide into multiplayer. Each section of the campaign plays out like an extended tutorial. You figure out the basics of the interface and base construction. You open up the whole list of buildings and units. You face varying objectives and a couple of seriously tough fights. Then you do the whole thing all over again with a different faction.', 'The Grey Goo campaign story is an interesting collection of fast-paced plot points, gorgeous cutscenes that look like excerpts from an animated sci-fi movie, and a sharp script coupled with first-rate voice acting (even if some of the accents are distracting, like the Beta who apparently come from deep space by way of Johannesburg). Everything held my interest, even though I could see the story twist coming a mile away.', 'Lack of mission variety and extreme difficulty proved more of a pain. Timed goals, waves of enemy attacks pressing my bases from the first moments of missions, and sudden challenges from new units firing down from hills and the air led to a bit of frustration and regular level replays. Enemy AI is smart and aggressive, probing weak points and continually hammering at defenses. Parts of the game are uncomfortably twitchy, forcing you to be quick with both combat and production orders, and many maps have a puzzle feel. I soon came to regard my first attempt at any campaign scenario as a suicide mission during which I needed to check out the battlefield. Gathering this reconnaissance info and then restarting was vital to having a reasonable shot at emerging victorious.', 'I didnt need any recon missions to figure out the Grey Goo factions. The two humanoid types are quite familiar, differing mainly in how they construct their bases. Humans are standard techy types centered on robot drones, which run the gamut from little gunboat thingies and looming siege tanks to giant mechs. Base-building is centralized, with headquarters established near a pool of the games single Catalyst resource (think of it as a magic oil that flows out of the ground at various points on maps). This is gathered up via an automated system and then pumped out through power supply conduits that allow for the construction of the usual factories, walls, gun turrets, and so forth. As you might expect, these lines are vulnerable to attack. If connections are cut, the power goes down. Tech can help with cutting the cord to some structures, and the Humans can also teleport units across the map as well as build powerhouse gun turrets for base defense, but generally, the lines are your life.', 'Beta have a similar feel, although they are more hard-and-fast brawlers fairly similar to that in a modern human military. Units consist of commandos, tanks, bombers, and the like. Their bases are much more self-contained than those of their Human counterparts. Large facilities near Catalyst pools host the main HQ, while smaller hubs (which also generally need to be located beside Catalyst for ready collecting) allow multiple modules to be hooked up, serving as factories and the like to expand your reach. Both Beta and Humans also have roughly parallel upgrade paths and tech options, so once you have a handle on one, you can easily slide over and control the other.', 'Only the Goo greatly stand out. They function in an entirely different manner, which is emphasized by a completely different interface (which is fortunately just as easy to use as that applied to the Beta and the Humans). Giant, amoeba-like Mother Goo serve as bases. Just settle one into a pool of Catalyst and it will soak up the resource over time, allowing for mama to begin reproducing. The longer you wait, the bigger the offspring can be, resulting in smaller globs of nanobots that can then be further split to serve as scouts, light assault tanks, artillery, and so forth. This results in some micromanagement, as you need to click back and forth to your mothers whenever enough Catalyst has been gathered for them to do the mitosis thing. Thankfully, the interface makes this a snap, by showing the status of each mama and allowing you to access them and give orders with a single click.', 'New Mother Goos can also be created to take over other Catalyst ponds and spread out your zone of control. And the original mom can be moved from one pool to another, gradually sliming her way to the front lines. As a result, the Goo are more mobile than just about any other RTS faction out there (they can also go just about everywhere, traverse otherwise impassable mountains, and so forth). This offers a lot of tactical options, although I personally found that the Goo best worked with rush tactics due to their quick consumption of Catalyst and their rapid reproduction. I could crank out huge armies and overwhelm opponents in short order. Goo form is just as unusual, as their creepy units resemble a cross between the old B-movie Blob and slightly see-through space octopi. Disjointed, electronic sound effects accompanying their movement add to their surreal, sci-fi character.', 'Maps are cunningly put together with an eye toward encouraging tactical thinking. This offers significant challenges both in the solo campaign and in multiplayer. Catalyst resource pools are spread apart just far enough to make you think tactically before attempting any sort of expansion. This places importance on smart, sustainable base building. It also emphasizes the value of erecting walls and gun turrets to protect your facilities.', 'The visual quality of the maps is impressive. Everything looks fantastic, with an incredible amount of detail that also has a significant impact on combat. The drawback here is how the game pushes even serious gaming systems, resulting in regular framerate hitches and pauses when transitioning from pop-up screens like tutorial tips.', 'Still, what you get in terms of look and feel is worth it. Forests and heavy brush provide camouflage akin to flipping on a cloaking device. Height offers similarly incredible benefits. Both are a little over the top. Even tanks become invisible in trees. Aerial units and those atop cliffs and hills cant even be fired upon by standard ground forces. But as much as I cursed when these strategies were used against me (that hill cant be more than 20-feet high--why the hell cant my commandoes shoot up there?!), I loved utilizing them myself as choke points, especially when setting up killing zones outside of bases. Just a few tanks stationed in the right place could decimate line after line of foes, letting me concentrate on other fronts.', 'Tactics are open, dependent on the ins and outs of the often puzzle-like map being battled over. Although I had success at times by turtling behind walls and building up Catalyst reserves with which to stream out huge armies, I also did well with rushing tactics when forced onto the offensive by aggressive AI or human players. A big help here is the absence of unit limits and the generally quick flow of building and tech progression that allows the zippy creation of masses of basic units such as the Beta Predator tank and the Goo Strider or Destructor.', 'Each faction also has an epic unit that can lay the smack down. I found cranking out swarms of the smaller units much more thrilling in that I am become Death! ego trip common to serving as an RTS general, due to the sheer fun of sending out columns of troops and tanks to cover the screen with laser fire. Still, it was also satisfying to fulfill the conditions necessary to let rip with the Betas super-tank/factory/cannon Hand of Ruk or the Human Alpha, a mech that could duke it out with Godzilla.', 'If you can get past the name to figure out what Grey Goo is supposed to be, you will discover one of the best traditional RTS games to hit the PC in a number of years. Petroglyph has done a terrific job both revisiting the tried-and-true formula that served as a foundation for the entire RTS genre, and providing catchy, tactically smart gameplay for the kids of the players who got everything going.']"Kevin VanOrd,30-Jan-15,Dying Light Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dying-light-review/1900-6416018/,7,PS4 & Xbox One,"['Oh, Dying Light, how I love you. I love the way you let me leap across rooftops and climb tall towers like an acrobat with endless supplies of energy. I love how I can dropkick a zombie and watch its flailing body knock over others like a fleshy bowling ball. I love looking over my shoulder as I run through the darkness, only to see a crowd of undead sprinting towards me, growling hideously and baring their ghastly teeth.', ""But oh, Dying Light, how you irritate me. I hate you for the gunners that ambushed me as I swam underwater, because there was no way to know how to react until I emerged and discovered that I wasn't meant to peek my head out--not yet. I hate you for that time you filled the screen with so much haze and bloom during a boss fight that I couldn't see properly. I hate that sequence when you made me leap from one pole to another, because you made it hard to get a good look at my surroundings, and your button prompts are hardly generous. And I hate these moments most because your systems are strong enough to let the open-world gameplay do the heavy lifting. The harder you try to direct the action, the weaker you become."", ' ', ""If you count yourself among the Dead Island fandom, your expectations are already set. You understand developer Techland's inconsistencies, and you are prepared to disregard the chaff so that you may reap the grain. Dying Light spawns from the same pile of mutated freaks as Dead Island, but it establishes its separate identity early on. The first difference to become clear is in tone: where Dead Island's story was difficult to take seriously, Dying Light sets the stage for a dark drama with a city overrun with infected victims, and a desperate populace anxious for hospice and aid. There are light touches here and there: you stumble upon The Bites Motel, for instance, and magazine covers and other details offer plenty of sight gags. But you are meant to be fearful and cautious, and you are meant to empathize with the survivors working so hard just to stay alive, let alone thrive."", ""As a covert operative sent to the city of Harran to recover a secret file, you find yourself in over your head, playing triple agent as you run errands for the city's two primary factions while radioing information to your agency's head honcho. Death is always in the air, not just because the infected have overrun the city's two sizable explorable areas, but because the survivors are so weary, so close to defeat. Dying Light lumbers through one cliche after another, but it's perfectly palatable: expressive faces and decent voice acting make the story beats and cutscenes worth paying attention to, even when the specifics--the antihero with a heart of gold, the doctor close to discovering a cure, the power-hungry villain--fall solidly within been-there, done-that territory."", ' ', ""Dying Light also sets itself apart with its parkour system, which sees you running across the city from a first-person perspective. It takes a short while to get used to climbing onto ledges, which requires you to be looking at them in the proper way. But then it's off to the races, and you're running across rooftops and sneering at the zombies below, most of which can't handle the climb. Rushing through the open world this way is terrific, due to solid (if not quite excellent) controls and well-constructed climbing and leaping paths, particularly in the game's second half, which takes place in the city's vertically-minded old town. Even better, the parkour energizes moments of great tension. Far Cry comparisons are easy, given how you unlock a few of the game's safe houses by climbing tall towers. But the climbing requires more finesse and situational awareness than it does in Far Cry 4, and some of the towers are outrageously tall, making the entire endeavor an anxious exercise in precision."", ""And tension is yet another aspect of Dying Light that sets it apart from its zombie-game peers. When night falls, particularly dangerous and fast zombies roam the city, and the entire timbre changes. It's best to circumvent the vision cones of those baddies and avoid direct confrontation, but you're occasionally mobbed in spite of your careful movement. These undead are more persistent than the Liberty City police department, so the best option is to run, run, run until you lose them. You can hold a button to look behind you and see how close they are, and doing so can be startling when you see the incoming horde. It's been some time since a zombie game legitimately scared me, but that look-behind-you move reveals some creepy sights. During the day, you scamper around and, occasionally, confront your infected fears. Once the sun has set, you slink and sprint, trying not to catch the deadly eyes of nearby volatiles."", ""Throw in a three-pronged upgrade system that makes you stronger and more agile as the game progresses, and you have the foundation of a great game. Alas, Dying Light flounders too often for it to achieve greatness, though it's poised to develop the same cult following that so many Techland games do. This is a surprisingly long game stuffed with, well, stuff, yet your role for too many hours is to play errand boy--a role so demeaning that even lead character Kyle Crane remarks upon it. Go flip a switch. Go collect crayons, or mushrooms, or coffee. As the first act draws to a close, Dying Light has taken a turn for the worse: each time the game grants you structure, it struggles, to the point where you might wish the gofer quests would return, because the ones that have taken their place are either frustrating slogs, or simply bad ideas."", ""The slog arises because these simple tasks require you to cover a lot of real estate. As fun as it is to move through Harran, the parkour doesn't carry the game alone. The other problem with Dying Light's first half, as dumb as it may sound, is the zombie crowd itself, which is not powerful enough to provide a huge challenge, but is too powerful to wholly ignore. The undead become annoyances--children that wave their arms around and demand attention while the game asks you to once again take to the streets so you can pull a lever."", 'The bad arrives when Dying Light embraces ideas that have an air of cleverness, but have you crying out ""what were you thinking?"" as implemented. There is the time you quaff a potion intended to temporarily disguise you from the undead, but it reverses your movement controls. And so death might very well ensue depending on when you drink and how quickly you adjust to the surprise. There is the time you descend on a zip line and let the game drop you at the very end of it, only to take a good amount of fall damage. There\'s a garbage pile a few feet before the end that you can leap into, but the limited field of view when ziplining, and the general visual bleariness, mean you probably won\'t know it\'s there until you\'ve lost half of your health bar, and you\'re cursing Techland for not noticing how these elements don\'t quite work together--or worse, for not caring.', 'These are just a few examples of the frustrations that set in. Once the second act arrives and you enter old town, however, there\'s a moment of revelation when you gaze upon the district and take in its beauty. The slog has been set aside, and excitement for new navigation blossoms. Depending on how you spend the skill points you earn, you gain access to a grappling hook that provides so much stimulation that you wish you\'d gained access to it even earlier. Then again, Dying Light gets occasionally lost in ""ideas"" even in the second half--shooting segments that lack tightness, confrontations with multiple kinds of big baddies that have you flying backwards and getting poisoned simultaneously, and so forth. You\'ve got the tools to succeed, at least, even when the fun meter drops: upgradable weapons starting with knives and baseball bats and working up to machetes and ice picks, along with throwables like grenades and molotov cocktails. Those weapons degrade quickly, but there are more of them scattered around than you will ever need.', 'When night falls, particularly dangerous and fast zombies roam the city, and the entire timbre changes.', ""Dying Light succeeds when it remains confident in its systems. The combat isn't as fulfilling as it is in Dead Island--you won't be breaking any arms--but out in that wild world, you aren't meant to wade into the horde anyhow. What drives the action is the promise of discovery and self-improvement. There are locks to pick and supplies to nab before the opposing faction gets to them. The balconies harbor new people to meet, who share their stories if you stick around long enough to hear them. When a zombie or six draw near, you swipe, kick, and bash until the blood is flying and the grunts are silenced, and you can return to your pillaging. Dying Light most often approaches greatness when it allows you to improvise your own tune instead of clumsily trying to conduct the entire orchestra."", ""That a game of such wild fluctuations can still give rise to so much fun speaks well of its high points. Those peaks rise even higher when other players are involved, and you have a few friends (up to three) join you, distracting the speedy virals while you take care of a ground-pounding beast swinging his giant hammer around. Competitive zombie invasions are liable to have you tensing your muscles even further invasions when they turn the game into a nighttime arena. This is Be the Zombie mode, and while using your tentacle to grapple your way around as a zombie is enjoyable, it is the tension you feel as a hunted human that makes these moments stand out. You can tweak your setting to allow or disallow these sudden multiplayer matches, and there's no shame in wanting to explore without distraction. But if Dying Light's nighttime pressures appeal to you, allowing zombie attacks further extends that drama."", ""I am rooting for Dying Light's success, even as I shake my head at its avoidable foibles. I understand it, I get it, and so I find pleasure in it even as it disappoints me, even when I land between a fence and a rocky cliff and get stuck there, even when I don't grab a ledge or pole after a jump for reasons that I can't quite understand. My dearest Dying Light, I am so grateful for your specialness, for it shines through even when I am prepared to damn you to hell."", ' ']"Cameron Woolsey,29-Jan-15,Nosgoth Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/nosgoth-review/1900-6416016/,6,PC,"['By name alone, Legacy of Kain brings up a host of fond memories. Whether those recollections star the vampire Kain as he faces the Circle of Nine, or Raziel, who rose from death to seek vengeance, the series is often held in high esteem. So, the revelation that the first game to return to the universe after more than 10 years is an online-only, free-to-play competitive action game comes as, well, unexpected. Nosgoth steps far out of Kains shadow, using its lore as a backdrop for a fast-paced, class-focused vampire-on-human multiplayer gore fest that is mostly entertaining, even though the excitement gets dragged down by shoddy matchmaking obstacles and irritating bugs.', 'The chord it strikes is similar to 2007s Shadowrun, not just in design but also in how it approaches its narrative. Canonically, its meant to bridge the 500-year gap during the opening scenes of Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver, but takes a perfunctory approach to its storytelling; realistically, Nosgoth is merely a spinoff. There are, however, casual reminders here and there that Legacy of Kain, plus Soul Reaver and its protagonist Raziel, are Nosgoths inspiration. Raziels ruined clan, represented by the disfigured sentinel class, is all that remains of his flying kin. And it isnt difficult to spot the enormous statue of a pre-crispy Raziel who stands watch over the chaotic human-on-vampire battles in The Fane, a map comprised of white marble and accented by gold leaf and torches burning with blue flame. Beyond the theme and the few hints and winks, however, little else of the Legacy of Kain fiction is found in Nosgoth.', ' ', 'Issues with the story aside, it concerns me that Nosgoth would follow Shadowruns lead, especially considering that the path Shadowrun ventured down didnt end with much success. Nosgoth even goes so far as to mimic some of Shadowruns own mimicry of the Counter-Strike formula, with matches consisting of two rounds, in which you start on the human or vampire team of four players each, and then get swapped to the other side once a necessary goal is met. But, thankfully, the similarities stop there, as Nosgoth primarily revolves around its team deathmatch modes, focusing on classes and team dynamics rather than using acquired cash to purchase weapons, gear, or special abilities between rounds. In team deathmatch, the winning side is determined after stacking up the total kills--with a maximum of 30 per session--acquired by each team during the ten-minute rounds.', 'Battles set in the eponymous dark-fantasy setting of Nosgoth are tense, energetic, and often wildly entertaining. Nosgoth leans heavily on the team element as an unconditional imperative. A single human, who spends the majority of a match nervously scanning rooftops and corners for movement, doesnt stand much chance when paired up against a physically dominating vampire. But likewise, a vampire stumbling alone into a group of quick-witted humans will rapidly find himself, for once, at the bottom of the food chain.', 'The vampire hunters are armed with technology and cunning, facing down their bloodsucking rivals with arrows and blades, snaring them with spells, and damaging them with deadly traps. But technology isnt enough; victory requires diversity. A team composed mostly of scouts, a sniping class, is powerless once the vampires get within mauling range. The scouts abilities are supplemented by a hunter class, which uses a crossbow for mid-range battles, and handy bolas, in normal and poison varieties, to temporarily restrain an enemy. Just as useful is the alchemist, who uses her launcher to lob explosive projectiles onto the heads of vampires hiding on rooftops, while utilizing an array of volatile chemical concoctions, such as vials of combustible liquid that erupt in a wall of flame, or containers filled with sunlight, which temporarily blinds oncoming bad guys.', 'What vampires lack in the technology of their mortal foes, they make up for in strength and incredible athletic prowess, making them an absolute blast to play. Unlike the gravity challenged humans, vampires can climb buildings and walls, stalking their prey and planning strikes from unseen heights. The deft reaver is able to leap far into the air, pouncing on his prey and slashing with metal claws. But maybe you prefer strength over speed; the imposing tyrant, muscle-bound and armed with abilities that allow him to charge through and knock over humans, as well as leap high into the air and emit a shockwave when landing, is as close to a vampire Hulk as Ive seen yet. The other two classes are the aforementioned sentinel, who can fly, snatch humans, and drop them from high in the air, and the deceiver, a strategic class, able to mask himself as a vampire hunter and strike from behind with a deadly blade.', 'No matter what class you choose, playing as a vampire is a joy. Bounding through the air as the reaver is something that never ceases to put a smile on my face. You get a giddy feeling of anticipation as you look around to see your allies, circled on walls and pillars, ready to strike your unsuspecting adversaries from above. Plus, its difficult to deny the savage thrill of dragging away the limp body of a defeated vampire hunter post battle to feast on his blood in order to regain lost health--except during rare moments of ""stretchy limb syndrome,"" which makes pulling a bloodied corpse that ends up stretching along the ground like taffy look, well, a tad goofy.', 'But then there is that pesky balancing problem, which far too often drags the pleasure of the hunt to a grinding, groan-inducing halt. The issue is a two-parter, but lets cut straight to the first point: the vampires are overpowered. Even as I hit more than 15 hours of play, I couldnt recall a match that didnt feel stacked against the human side, even if the advantage was only slight. During most of my games, all I could hope for when on the human team was to reach at least 15 kills. That way, if my opponents proved somewhat more incapable playing as humans, a victory could still be secured. Make no mistake, I witnessed capable human teams, but even the most skilled players seemed lost as to how to proceed when their opponents switched classes and charged forward with several tyrants. Its not just a question of countering with the right classes and abilities; matching classes is important, but still, the vast majority of games I played as a human were losses, even as I became more confident in my vampire-hunting skills.', 'Nosgoth at its finest is still a promising multiplayer game, and I look forward to seeing how far it goes. It does need more: more classes, more maps, more game modes, more everything.', 'On the subject of skill, the likelihood of getting matched with or against players of similar aptitude is a crapshoot, which brings up the second part of the balancing issue: matchmaking is broken. You gain experience points that slowly increase your level over the course of play. That rank, however, doesnt seem to matter once you leave new recruit mode, designed to ease novice players into Nosgoth, and get placed into standard team deathmatch games. Its common to get matched against teams that are either well below your skill level or far beyond it. Fighting a team that struggles to get even 10 kills against your own makes for a rather boring 20 minutes, but when the tables are turned, it results in immense frustration. Matchmaking also seems to have issues with finding players. Sometimes, a game will start right away, but at other times, you are left waiting for a vacant spot to fill for upwards of several minutes.', 'At least Nosgoths maps, save for one that sports ugly, low-resolution mountains in the background, look fantastic enough to distract from any grievance for a short while. The five available maps are large, beautiful, and meticulously detailed, featuring a varied color palette that makes each one easily distinguishable from the others. Its difficult not to look upon The Fane, a town deep within a vaulted cave, with some measure of awe. Other environs are scarred by battle, and the sound of muffled screams brings weight to fights, surrounded by buildings set alight. Nearby, fountains that were once ornate, cluttered with corpses, now run red with blood. Every map is also dotted with well-placed and quickly accessible shrines, where human players can fill up on health and ammunition--so long as they watch their backs.', 'Like many free-to-play games, Nosgoth includes different payment options. Bundles can be purchased that will unlock classes, character skins, and new abilities, and that offer a sum of gold, the latter of which is earned at the end of every match. Normally, any gold that is acquired can be used to unlock new class abilities for up to one week for a small amount, or permanently for a much larger chunk of change. Based on my experience, it takes about six to eight hours of play to earn enough gold to unlock a single ability forever, which means you will either need to dedicate a lot of time to get the loadouts you desire, or pony up the cash if time isnt in your favor. Runes, currency that must be bought using real-world money, can also unlock any of the prior items in place of gold. Character skins, which serve as aesthetic upgrades, can only be traded for with runes.', 'Outside of Nosgoths team deathmatch, there isnt much else in the way of content. There are three modes of play, but two of them, new recruit and team deathmatch, are basically the same in design. Flashpoint, the third multiplayer mode, is currently in beta testing, and does provide a different, if ultimately brief, distraction. The mode is a king of the hill variation, in which the human team attempts to capture six points on a map as the vampire side fights to keep the beacons out of the grimy hands of mortals. I found it difficult to want to keep playing Flashpoint, as it isnt distinctive enough compared to team deathmatch to hold my attention long. There are also only five maps at launch, and though they are all nice to look at, it didnt take much time before I yearned for a change in scenery.', ""Officially, Nosgoth is in open beta, but Square Enix explicitly states that this beta constitutes the game's launch. Nonetheless, it comes with the bugs and glitches associated with a game in progress. There are times when your vampire may refuse to completely vault over a ledge onto a rooftop, which is particularly bad during a hasty escape, when his pallid backend may become a pincushion. Worse, however, are the rare connection errors with the server, which vary in range from bolas and arrows flying through enemies, to warping from one wall back into the original without warning. But these are standard-issue problems for the most part; what stands out above all is the fickle party system. At times, accepting an invite doesnt place you in a party according to your screen, though the hosts screen shows otherwise, and trying to join a match with a broken party never works. But at least that isnt as bad as when the game decides to crash, which it does on occasion after you accept a game invite."", 'Nosgoth is surprisingly fun, given the glaring problems. Sure, matchmaking is a mess and glitches need to be ironed out, but Nosgoth at its finest is still a promising multiplayer game, and I look forward to seeing how far it goes. It does need more: more classes, more maps, more game modes, more everything. And for the most part, the developer has been upfront that updates are coming quickly, starting with a new map and a female vampire class, both to arrive in the following weeks, with a new human class to arrive soon after. No, Nosgoth is not the Legacy of Kain everyone wanted, and it isnt exactly bold or fresh either, especially considering that it evokes bitter memories of a failed game from 2007. But with additional content, bug fixes, and needed matchmaking tweaks, Nosgoth could be something that stands strong on its own, worth returning to time and again.']"Kevin VanOrd,29-Jan-15,Life is Strange Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/life-is-strange-episode-one-review/1900-6416015/,7,Xbox One & PS4 & PC,"['""It was a dark and stormy night."" So wrote novelist Edward Bulwer-Lytton, creating the writing cliche to end all cliches, and inadvertently describing Life is Strange\'s opening scene. There\'s also a lighthouse in this scene, that old signaler of melodrama to come, rising above you amid the falling rain. The torrential imagery bookends the first episode of this five-part adventure, but most of the drama is of the teenage type. There are snotty girls to contend with, and privileged jocks accustomed to people bending to their will. Students fuss passive-aggressively on social media, and older adults are either mentors or bullies. This is the world seen through a young adult\'s eyes, a world in which every sight, sound, and whisper is full of life-ending, life-making meaning.', 'The particular young adult you play is Max Caulfield--no relation to The Catcher in the Rye\'s Holden Caulfield it would seem, though Life is Stranges references are not subtle, so I presume that Maxs similarities to her namesake are not accidental. Like Holden, Max attends a private school, though her primary interest is photography and not football or fencing. Shes back in her Oregon hometown to attend school after spending the last several years in Seattle, where life wasnt quite what she had imagined. ""When we would play pirates in our room and in the woods, it seemed like Seattle was that fabled faraway island of treasure and adventure that we were always seeking. With coffee shops,"" writes Max in her diary. ""But Seattle wasn\'t like a fable.""', ""As it turns out, life at Blackwell Academy isn't idyllic, either. After a stern lecture by her photography professor, Max wanders through the schools halls to the bathroom. Shes out of sorts: she had what seemed to be a nightmare in class--that dark-and-stormy-night scenario that began the game, and which showed a tornado roaring towards the town. As Max, you walk past blue lockers covered with posters that admonish students not to text and drive, and comment silently to yourself about the classmates you pass. When Max plugs earbuds into her ears, you hear the light indie-rock you imagine an angsty teen from the Pacific Northwest might listen to--the kind that plays when you enter a Starbucks. This may not be your reality, but it is easy to believe is it Max's. The themes and characters are familiar, in any case: the aloof school principal, the quiet religious girl, and the anxiety of being called on in class when you dont know the answer."", ""Well, there is one aspect that is decidedly unreal: you can rewind time. You discover your special skill during your restroom visit, when a heated confrontation between a psychopathic rich kid and the girl that confronts him ends with a bullet in the young womans abdomen. In that moment, you reach out to help and time quickly zips back to minutes before, when you are still in class. Now you know the answers when Prof. Jefferson asks you. Now you can tell him what he wants to hear about the photography contest he wants you to enter. And now you have a chance to save an old friend's life."", 'Time reversal is Life is Strange\'s most unique element, but also its most problematic. The game is rooted in the adventure formula that has made Telltale Games\'s Walking Dead series so popular. You walk around the environments, interacting with people and objects, and making choices during dialogue that turn the story in a particular direction. ""This action will have consequences,"" the game tells you, and you then wonder about the potential consequences, and mentally note them when they occur. After a single episode, it is hard to tell how intervening when a security officer is harassing a student will shift the future, but should you not like the immediate reaction, you just rewind a bit and do it over again. It\'s a nifty effect at first, but the rewind as a whole undermines one of the formula\'s most treasured elements: ownership of your decisions.', ""Granted, there are limitations, so you cant return to the moment of truth when a consequence becomes apparent hours later. But undoing a line of dialogue because a classmate reacts poorly to you diminishes the choice's power. I rarely sweated my decisions, because I could just try again until I landed on the one I liked best. I suspect that I may come to regret seemingly easy choices when more episodes are released and the repercussions play out. For now, however, I don't feel much ownership of Max; In The Wolf Among Us, it was clear that I was playing my Bigby, but after a single episode of Life is Strange, Max isn't my Max--she's just Max."", 'The rewind mechanic also allows for a few light puzzles. When you rewind time you keep what you have recently picked up, and of course, you have new information you didnt have before. As a result, you might be able to perform new actions and have new conversations. Rewinding only affects the people and events surrounding you; you remain in place, with any items you may carry, while time retreats everywhere else. In this sense, rewinding your surroundings is like fast-forwarding your own body. You can avoid falling objects, for instance, by rewinding time, moving forward, and resetting time with you further ahead than when you started. Annoyingly, however, Life is Strange breaks its own time-bending rules when it suits the narrative. When you first discover your skill, for instance, you are moved back into your classroom seat, and do not remain in the bathroom. Developer Dontnod has its cake, and eats it too.', ""Inconsistencies of time reversal aside, Life is Strange is an involving slice of life that works because its situations eloquently capture a peculiar early-college state of mind. Some of the characterizations are too on-the-nose: of course Maxs rebellious friend Chloe smokes weed and talks back to her stepfather, because thats what rebellious teens do, and of course that stepfather is an ex-military authoritarian with a buzzcut and a bad temper. This is storytelling shorthand, but much of it rings beautifully true. When Max is reunited with Chloe, the tension chokes the air: Chloe feels abandoned and angry at being left behind when Max moved, and at being ignored when Max returned to town. Max doesnt necessarily have answers for all of her choices, only apologies. These interactions can break your heart specifically because you might have had such conversations yourself. The performances, especially those of the actresses that play Max and Chloe, amplify the laughs, the groans, and the tears in equal measure, even when the dialogue takes a clumsy turn. (As it does, for instance, when you meet Blackwell's creepy janitor.)"", 'Life is Strange sets the stage for later conflict, foreshadowing the storm to come and informing you of a young local woman gone missing. At the same time, the game makes everyone look like a guilty party. The rich frat boy with a gun, the smug school administrator, the stepdad in need of anger management skills--these and other characters have plenty to hide, though its impossible to guess what all their secrets might be. The looming tornado and the inconsistent time mechanic seem almost unnecessary as a result, for Life is Stranges most important drama is the one developing in Maxs own mind.']"Jeremy Signor,28-Jan-15,The Marvellous Miss Take Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-marvellous-miss-take-review/1900-6416012/,6,PC,"[""We need more heist games in our lives. Stealth games are a dime a dozen, but only in heist games are you required to play with confidence. We need the thrill of strolling into a heavily-guarded museum or bank and lifting priceless items from under everyone's noses. And we need to feel vindicated and smug as we walk out of the place with no one the wiser. That's the essence that The Marvellous Miss Take attempts to embody, steering you to fearlessly swipe paintings and sculptures under the careful watch of patrons and guards. But though the game wants you to feel like you're overcoming incredible odds thanks to your innate cunning, its unreasonably small levels and erratic enemy behavior destroy the very confidence it demands of you."", ""But first, you're eased into a life of crime. You play as Sophia Take, an art enthusiast who saw her great aunt's collection swindled away and split among greedy one percenters. She takes matters into her own hands and sets out to steal the art back. (She even resembles everyone's favorite world-class educational thief, Carmen Sandiego.) Though Miss Take is brimming with resolve, she soon reveals that she's a little unsure of herself to Harry Carver, a well-to-do and benevolent master thief who she bumps into in the middle of a caper. Together with Harry and pickpocket Daisy, Sophia slowly accumulates more and more of her great aunt's collection, gaining more confidence with each heist. These three figures form the core of the game's story and characterization, and, though it's tempting to paint them as one-dimensional afterthoughts, the game pulls off some subtle tricks to fill in the gaps."", ""Sophia's initial uncertainty carries into the player experience as well. You must abscond with all the art on the current floor and then either board an elevator or make your way to the exit. Guards' fields of vision are represented by giant blue cones that protrude from their eyes as you look down on the floor from a semi-isometric view. The levels themselves are cramped, with guards' vision often filling 75 percent of a room, making success seem impossible. But the game invites you to overcome these feelings by trying to gradually make you realize the ease with which you can accomplish your goals. The controls are dead simple, as the game can be played solely with the mouse. Just click on a spot, and Sophia moves there. Hold down the left mouse button and she starts running, though her haste makes noise that attracts guards, as does whistling by holding the mouse button down over her."", ""You start the game feeling intimidated by the sheer number of blue cones covering the levels. You feel shy about walking up to grab a painting while a guard's back is turned, but you learn to time your pacing in order to boldly walk to your target before the guard is any the wiser. You're afraid to set foot in a heavily-guarded area for fear of stepping into a guards field of vision, but being seen doesn't get you caught immediately. Instead, a glimpse of you only gets a guard's attention and lures him or her to the last point at which you were seen. Stay in sight too long and you alert the guards, but duck out of sight in time and you can lure guards to wherever you need them to be."", ""Even Sophias partners' side missions encourage you to come out of your shell. Harry has a leg injury and needs a cane to walk, so he's unable to run. This means that his heists happen at night when guard activity is at a minimum. He must sneak around armed with only a weird ball-like contraption, which makes noise when thrown against a wall. This teaches you not to rely on running to and fro and also encourages you to actually use the many power-ups the game gives Sofia, such as smoke bombs that block vision or teleporters that let you make a quick getaway. Daisy's missions, on the other hand, require you to get up close and personal with guards, picking their pockets to get keys and make off with a safe's contents. Though Daisy's prowess at pickpocketing means that she can approach guards without them becoming suspicious, it teaches you, when being Sophia, not to be so timid when it comes to worming your way through the guard-filled minefield. When you start getting the hang of navigating the security and playing the guards like saps, your confidence starts to snowball until you feel like a master thief. And clearly Sofia does too, as after clearing a level, she puts her hand on her hips and throws heavy shade at the mooks she just put to shame."", 'The moments in which you should be slipping past a heavily-guarded room to snag a bust are often ruined thanks to a guard who happens to turn the wrong way.', ""At least, that's the experience the game wants you to have, and occasionally it succeeds. But, though the game attempts to convey scenarios that make you feel like you're succeeding against all odds, the game commits the sin of actually stacking the odds against you. The fact that most rooms are bathed in blue does make the levels somewhat unmanageable even when you learn all the tricks. The cramped corridors and tiny rooms make maneuvering more of a chore than it needs to be. Worst of all is the inconsistent enemies, who, aside from the frequency with which they change direction, are completely unpredictable. Guards patrol in whatever direction strikes their fancy with seemingly no rhyme or reason. Now, not having predictable patterns isn't necessarily a bad thing if a game is designed with unpredictability in mind, but with so little space to work with and only one tool at your disposal at a time, you often find yourself waiting for an enemy to happen to wander to just the right spot so that you can enact your plan. This also means that the moments in which you should be slipping past a heavily-guarded room to snag a bust are often ruined thanks to a guard who happens to turn the wrong way. This takes your supposed skill out of the equation somewhat and makes the game a frustrating slog."", ""It also doesn't help that the world itself isn't terribly interesting. For a game that seems built on slick intrigue, the levels themselves all play just about the same, albeit with varying degrees of frustration. Each floor you have to tackle is just a bunch of hallways connecting a bunch of bigger rooms. You barely ever get to use the environment to your advantage in clever ways, adding a thick layer of monotony to proceedings. Gimmicks such as dogs who can smell your footsteps, security cameras, and lasers add some much-needed variety, but once you encounter them once, you've seen all they have to offer. Levels also offer no visual panache, looking very sterile and plain, which is disappointing because the game's soundtrack embodies the slick, stylish world of high-class thievery."", ""The Marvellous Miss Take aims to be a different kind of confidence game, one in which you stroll into a level like you own the place and take whatever you wish with ease. All the pieces are in place to build you up and make you a virtual master thief, and Sofia's journey is the perfect embodiment of this process. It's just a shame that the game's level design and enemy combine to short-circuit the experience throughout, because there are so many individual pieces that make the game really easy to like. Sofia deserves better."", ' ']"Don Saas,28-Jan-15,Gravity Ghost Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/gravity-ghost-review/1900-6416014/,8,PC,"['Childhood is terrifying. Childhood is beautiful. Childhood is full of wonder. And childhood is marked by the continual loss of innocence that comes with each new year. Learning that the unexplored experiences which is exciting and enticing could kill you is part of growing up; as is learning that there are consequences to all of our actions no matter how pure our intentions may be. Those are heavy themes for adults to handle, let alone children, but they rest at the core of delightful platformer Gravity Ghost.', ""In Gravity Ghost, you control the ghost of Iona, a recently deceased young girl who lives on a secluded island with her two younger sisters and her older sister, Hickory, who became their guardian after the tragic death of their parents. The circumstances leading up to Iona's death unfurl throughout her story as tensions between her and Hickory arise: she believes that her sister's fiance was responsible for their parents' deaths. You meet Voy, a seemingly tame wolf that Iona has befriended. And you watch Iona retreat deeper and deeper into her own heartache and isolation as the mystery and tension surrounding her death grow."", ""Gravity Ghost combines the aesthetics of Maurice Sendak with the narrative power of classic Don Bluth films like The Secret of NIMH, yet there's little to compare the game's overall style to. The art is like the pages of an illustrated children's book come to life with painstaking details and a beautiful colored-pencils effect, and before the (welcome) heavier elements of the story arrived, I grinned ear to ear at the sincere innocence of it all. But Gravity Ghost is a story about the price of innocence, and it explores guilt and death and family from a child's point of view without sacrificing clarity of insight and without ever looking down on or being condescending towards the perspective of its young star. Gravity Ghost operates on pure empathy, and the story's denouement left me on the verge of tears."", ""Gravity Ghost's gameplay is also quite good, although it never quite reaches the magnificent heights of the game's storytelling and art. Gameplay revolves around platforming with a physics twist. You leap back and forth between planetoid objects of varying sizes and manipulate the gravity wells of each object to shoot yourself across the levels. Along the way you collect stars which open the doors to finish each level, and flowers which lengthen ghost Iona's hair and allow you in turn to collect the ghosts of dead animals and terraform planets. Returning those animal-ghosts to their former bodies also leads to the sublimely animated cutscenes which move the story forward."", ""The variety of celestial objects in the game is a perfect fit for its tight three-hour running time. Gas giants allow you to bounce like a pinball machine. Fire planets propel you high in the sky off their steam. Water planets allow you to dive beneath their surfaces to collect stars and flowers. And gem planets are super-dense with stronger gravity wells than normal. Over the course of the seven constellations--with around 80 or so small levels in total--that make up the game's campaign, you also gain the ability to terraform the planets from one type to another, which is necessary for solving many of the game's simple puzzles."", ""Leaping back and forth between the gravity wells to collect the stars and flowers and ghosts and power-ups isn't always the smoothest experience, but the game gives you a host of tools to circumnavigate most potential sources of frustration, except in timed segments where the looseness of the gravity physics can become aggravating. Despite the looseness of the controls, bouncing and floating between the planets is an oddly Zen experience and it becomes quite soothing before long. It also helps that the soundtrack, from FTL composer Ben Prunty, adds to the games strange rejuvenative power."", 'The worst thing that can be said about Gravity Ghost is that I crave more of it.', ""Beyond the occasionally frustrating timed segments, the worst thing that can be said about Gravity Ghost is that I crave more of it. The game is short. It took me just over three hours to do a 100-percent run for each star and ghost and power-up. And, once you've beaten it, there are few incentives to go back and play again, minus chasing a couple of achievements you wouldn't think to chase on your first go around. But while Gravity Ghost may be short, it never overstays its welcome. Each constellation is the perfect length, and the game continues to implement new mechanics and kinks into the core gameplay up to the final levels."", ""It's easy to capture the happiest moments of being a child: friendships, vacations, exploring the vast, uncharted world in front of you. But it's hard to convey the toughest moments, those moments that we compartmentalize and repress beyond recognition as adults. And it's especially hard to convey such moments in language and images that both children and adults can appreciate and understand. That Gravity Ghost accomplishes this feat with such seeming ease is a testament to its imagination and its power.""]"Kevin VanOrd,27-Jan-15,Grim Fandango Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/grim-fandango-remastered-review/1900-6416008/,8,PS4,"['In video games, some trends go out of style, and old stand-bys are cast aside when better alternatives are discovered. Some elements of art are timeless, however. Language and culture may change, but empathetic characters and great stories never fade from fashion. Grim Fandango has always stood tall as one of the PC adventure greats, and the deft storytelling and warm humor that made it so inviting remain evergreen.', ""You can thank Manny Calavera for that warmth, which may come as a surprise given that hes cold and buried. Manny is a travel agent in the land of the dead, where he suffers the arrogance of a cocksure co-worker and the disrespectful gaze of a corrupt boss. Theyre all skeletons--most dead people are, of course--but theyre more human than most video game characters. As Manny flees his job in pursuit of the beautiful and skinless client who has captured his heart, he surrounds himself with an eclectic array of kooks, including the obese and naive Glottis, a demon mechanic prone to betting on cat races. The doctors made me promise I wouldn't do it any more, he says, when Manny confronts him. But they cant get in the high rollers lounge, now can they?"", ' ', 'Glottis is Mannys closest friend, but theres room in his life for other demons--and more than a few souls who have wandered off the four-year path to the ninth underworld. This is Mictlan, the afterlife through the eyes of the Aztecs, who envisioned that path as being filled with deadly obstacles like winds made of razor-sharp blades. Manny encounters obstacles (this is a puzzle-adventure, after all), but few are quite as deadly as knife-wind, though there are dangerous flaming beavers to contend with. In its illustrations, the holy Codex Borgia depicts Mictlan as teeming with surreal wildlife and grotesque deities; Grim Fandango looks to Mexican celebration Dia de Muertos for its primary artistic inspiration, however. Its as if Manny and his skeletal friends have leapt from a Jose Guadalupe Posada drawing, or perhaps just escaped a particularly joyous Day of the Dead celebration.', ""You neednt know about Grim Fandangos cultural significance to grow attached to its characters. Every situation is steeped in humor, but the chuckles rarely come at anyones expense. The game is both funny and gentle: even the most mercurial residents of this world are allowed their dignity, and the adventure is better for it. Glottis may be good for some lighthearted comedy, but hes not the butt of the joke; when he tells Manny, I don't want to be a pianist any more. I'm a mechanic, its hard not to be moved. Its a fitting tone, considering how Dia de Muertos invites us to celebrate those that have passed by remembering how they made us laugh. Mannys surname itself refers both to actual skulls as well as to humorous poems that honor the dead, which makes a scene in which he attempts a bit of beat poetry particularly wonderful. (My teeth... Everythingness. Or is it? I am your failure. Ske-bee bop, bop! Ske-bee bop, bop! Woman? The phone is for you.)"", ""But what about the play? Returning to an old game can make you appreciate advancements that have since come. Playing Grim Fandango Remastered, however, might make you wonder why point-and-click adventures didnt more frequently crib from its pages. You do not swipe a cursor around, hunting for interactive objects. Instead, you steer Manny directly using either the original's tank controls or an updated scheme in which Manny moves in the direction you push, and his bony head turns to look at the people he can speak with and the things he can collect as you pass them. (The PC version of the remaster comes with a point-and-click scheme, but Grim Fandango is at its most personal when you use direct controls.) Its a lovely solution to a genre-wide design issue, yet so uncommon that it feels utterly fresh. The games inventory management is equally brilliant: Manny reaches into his suit jacket and cycles through each item one at a time. There is no laborious item combining within the inventory screen, and developer Double Fine never allows Mannys jacket to become overstuffed with doodads."", 'That means that the focus can remain on the puzzles themselves, almost all of which make absolute sense within this world. It may sound silly, but in context, it makes absolute sense that you would scare away pigeons by fooling them into pecking an inflated balloon animal. If you get stuck, its not because you arent following a ridiculous line of logic that no reasonably smart person could guess. No--chances are you havent explored thoroughly enough, or Double Fine actually managed to fool you with a red herring, such as one involving a loaf of ceremonial bread and an old-fashioned pneumatic tube.', 'That isnt to say Grim Fandango doesnt harbor its minor annoyances. Its easy, for instance, to walk into that elevator in Rubacava by accident when you wander too close and descend to ground level, only to have to get back in and rise again to the top. More relevant is the remastering itself, which might leave you disappointed in light of the dramatic visual transformations we see in remakes like Oddworld: New n Tasty!, or remasters like Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary. You can see the differences between the old version and the remaster with a click of a button, and youll note that environments and cutscenes havent changed in any meaningful way. Granted, Grim Fandangos background art remains vibrant, but the new, smooth character models and shadows sometimes look out of place as a result. I often found myself sticking with the original models just because they looked more natural in front of the low-resolution backgrounds.', ' ', 'There is a significant bright side if you are interested in video game archival, however: developer commentary. Its an all-too-rare treat, and one that belongs in any remaster, of which there have lately been too many to count. Of course, it helps that Grim Fandango lead developer Tim Schafer is so good-natured when sharing his memories, but the commentary is endlessly entertaining, whether the Double Fine team is cracking jokes about dulce de membrillo (would have thought that a brief story about quince cheese would be so silly and sweet?) or waxing serious about the Red Scare. The directors commentary is a standard DVD and Blu-Ray feature, which makes the scarcity of video game commentary all the more disheartening, particularly when remasters, remakes, and reimaginings are de rigeur.', 'Grim Fandangos greatest triumph, however, is that you neednt overflow with nostalgia to appreciate its greatness. There is only this boisterous world and the unionized bee-demons that inhabit it, which you see through the eyes of one Manny Calavera, an everyday hero that has rightfully earned a place in video game history. Even if you dont know what happens at the end of the line, youre guaranteed to enjoy the trip.']"Don Saas,26-Jan-15,Switch Galaxy Ultra Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/switch-galaxy-ultra-review/1900-6416011/,6,PlayStation Vita & PS4,"[""Life's not easy when you're a wannabe Lothario and rogue but your day job is being the galaxy's most reliable (and poorly behaved) freight hauler. Sure, you get to kick up your boots in some of the most disreputable dive bars on the galaxy's outer ring, and you could cut the sexual tension between you and your boss--a wealthy and nearly immortal shipping magnate--with a butter knife, but you also have to push your freighter at breakneck speeds through the galaxy's most congested shipping lanes and protect your bounty from greedy pirates and even greedier tax men. But, hey... it's a living."", 'These are the worlds and emotions and possibilities shimmering on the surface of Switch Galaxy Ultra, a hyperkinetic arcade racer from British developer Atomicom Limited. And though the tantalizing backgrounds and universe that the game inhabits are never fully capitalized on, SGU takes you on a top-speed adventure with the potential to be a welcome retro throwback. Unfortunately, troubling glitches and repetition keep it from crossing its own finish line.', ""SGU follows the adventures of Vince Vance, a less charming version of Han Solo who needs a little dough after a fight in an alien casino. Luckily, his old job running freight for the Dakur Corporation, one of the galaxy's biggest enterprises, is waiting for him, and Vince sets out with his ship to collect and deliver Tantalum--the game's sci-fi technobabble plot mover--over the packed and busy interstellar highways that are his home away from home."", ""Aside from short interludes throughout the rest of the campaign that have no narrative connection to one another, that's all the story there is in SGU. The game begins on a beautifully drawn if unimaginatively written series of comic book pages that introduce the game's universe, and rare and very short comic book pages add more flavor to the universe later without providing any sort of overarching story. SGU provides the groundwork for a potential twist on the space trucking trope and then fails to go anywhere with it."", ""All of SGU's attention after those lavishly drawn comic book pages is placed on its core racing mechanics, which are, fortunately, as solid as it gets. SGU's core gameplay should be familiar to anyone who's played games like Audiosurf or Amplitude. You control a ship on progressively larger and more complicated tracks, and input is limited to acceleration, braking, and switching lanes. Multi-colored barriers, broken track sections, and other long-haul space truckers are all obstacles to clearing a record-fast run. A mini-game is also included at the halfway point of each track to collect Tantalum, which is used to unlock new levels, and any collisions with barriers after Tantalum is collected causes you to lose pieces of Tantalum from that level."", ""When SGU sticks to its simple but elegant racing, it can be a blast. Over the course of the campaign (over 50 levels), new obstacles and bonuses and mechanics are introduced at a steady pace. You can hit boost pads to kick your acceleration to supersonic speeds. You can pick up colored orbs that allow you free passage through a specific number of barriers of that color without being slowed down or losing your Tantalum. Bombs are placed in the track that you can activate by colliding with them, which in turn wipes out whole sections of barriers. Enemies slowly arrive and bomb the track and can slow your ship down with explosions or cause your controls to be inverted, which is a particularly nasty trick when you're moving so fast that your brain, eyes, and fingers must be totally in synch not to crash."", ""Nailing the most brutal slaloms requires a Jedi-like focus, and the only immediately comparable sense of achievement is nailing the rhythm of the toughest riffs from tracks in the Guitar Hero or Rock Band games. If you have the game's best ship with maxed-out stats (which is easy and happens well before you reach the final level), you will whip around stages like a stunt driver in a Fast and the Furious film, and you will feel totally in tune with your ship and the game's environments. Later stages are hallucinatory with their labyrinthine structures of barriers and the narrow passageways that you can survive in. The effect of the blur of colors and the focus required to navigate these levels are hypnotic, and when I stopped playing the game, my vision continued to tilt and swirl like the rollercoaster tracks I had just conquered."", ""The game's difficulty is a steady curve from challenging to masochistic, but it's too easy to simply ignore the challenges that the game asks you to overcome. Collected Tantalum is used to unlock later levels, and there's an assumption in the game that you'll progress through until you reach gated-off levels and return to early levels to collect the required Tantalum needed to progress. But it becomes apparent early on that acquiring Tantalum is childishly easy. Tantalum can only be lost in the second half of the tracks, and the speed with which you finish a track does not factor into level progression. So, once Tantalum is acquired, there's little reason (beyond personal pride) to push yourself to race through the second half of tracks at your best speed. Instead, it's much easier and more efficient to just hold down the brake and cruise through, ensuring that you don't lose any precious resources."", ""And that's especially problematic because it turns the end game into a repetitive, mindless bore. You will need nearly all of the game's Tantalum--10 pieces can be collected per level--to finish the game's campaign, and, while backtracking is kept to a minimum at the beginning and middle, by the end of the game, if you liked to try to push yourself on your first runs throughout the campaign, you will have to return to almost every level you visited picking up those remaining pieces of Tantalum you dropped. It's not a stretch to say that over half the time I spent with SGU involved backtracking to earlier levels."", 'While the tracks themselves--especially the later ones--are massive, the game recycles most of its environmental assets more times than I could keep track of. The first time you see the imposing and highly detailed space station/city that marks the end of your laps, the sense of scale it creates is daunting and eye-opening. When you see it 50 more times, it loses its wonder, and the same goes for the asteroids, planets, and space stations that dot your journeys.', ""Performing well in missions earns you credits that can be spent to upgrade your ship and buy new ones. And returning to early levels with a stacked ride is entertaining, as you travel so fast and your ship is so tough that hitting a barrier here or there becomes as meaningful as a fly running into the windshield of a semi. They barely slow you down. But there aren't enough progression options to fill out the game's sluggish end, and by the time I reached the last group of levels, I'd amassed a fortune in credits because I'd run out of meaningful things to spend money on."", ""While SGU lays the groundwork for a strange and unique sci-fi universe, perhaps it's for the best that there isn't more traditional narrative. When SGU's writing isn't simply reading like Star Trek techno-nonsense, it can feel downright offensive. The game's humor is sophomoric at best, and alien characters come off as unfortunate appropriations of real-world cultures, including your sultry and clearly Russian boss and a smug alien in a dive bar that reeks of awful Hispanic stereotypes. With some cheap titillation in the art on a planet with naked alien priestesses, SGU tosses casual misogyny into its grab bag of cheap writing."", ""If you're willing to block out the story and to seek out the challenges that SGU provides too many ways to avoid, a deceptively fun and enticing arcade racer is there for the taking. The game is available for cross-buy for both the Vita and the PS4, and, while even the solid racing charms don't survive long play sessions, it's not hard to imagine being on a plane or on a bus and finding myself taking the chance to shave a couple more seconds off another breakneck run."", ' ']"Brett Todd,22-Jan-15,Blackguards 2 Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/blackguards-2-review/1900-6416009/,8,PC,"['It feels awfully good to be bad. Tactical role-playing game Blackguards 2 understands that letting out those inner demons to play a villain can be one of the most cathartic things about playing a game. In this case, Daedalic Entertainment taps right into the evil vein with a deliciously dark tale that glories in such black-hatted pastimes as taking slaves, okaying battlefield massacres, and hanging prisoners as a cost-effective alternative to feeding them. This unrelentingly grim plot personality is further enhanced with smart game mechanics and devious (if a little plodding) combat that offers challenges both on the battlefield and when tricking out your anti-heroes. Gimmick and gameplay are blended into a satisfying mix that comes out as a unique concoction equal to much more than the sum of its parts, especially if you occasionally like to walk on the dark side.', ""Blackguards 2's heart may just be two sizes too small. Like the game's early-2014 predecessor, The Dark Eye: Blackguards (despite the minor name change, this sequel still takes its rules and setting from the German pen-and-paper roleplaying game The Dark Eye), Daedalic Entertainment is once again offering up a bleak experience in which you play the bad guys in a single player-only campaign (the only mode of play). This time out the evil crew is led by new protagonist Cassia, a noblewoman who begins the game in a tough spot. Really tough. Instead of calling a divorce attorney, her kingly hubby Marwan has dumped her into a maze-like dungeon to be driven mad by loneliness or killed by the thousands of giant poisonous spiders that call the place home. Cassia manages to escape after four long years, but by the time she leaves her eight-legged buddies she's both crazy and facially deformed by the spider venom. Instead of adopting a cheerful, Rocky Dennis approach to the world, though, she turns into a cruel, raving nutbag obsessed with killing her ex and taking over the kingdom via using the worst people in the land as henchmen and recruiting a gang of brutal mercenaries to serve as her shock troops."", 'Not much here is played for laughs. Cassia is disturbingly insane. One of the dialogue options lets her talk to herself, which generally results in loony ramblings like ""Everything is staring at me with eyes like thorns...they want to prick me to see if I bleed!"" So, nuts, but certainly not in a ha-ha way. Cassia quickly turns into a gaming anti-hero for the ages. Her gang of lecherous, miserly, sadistic, and suicidal comrades are just as reprehensible, with a host of psychiatric disorders taken straight from the DSM-5. All are brought to life through lengthy and varied conversational options offered up constantly through the campaign during the hub camp and town screens between missions, when you can trade off between chatting with your murderous pals and shopping for gear. Personalities are well established through insightful scripting and impressive voice acting. All become distinct individuals in the end, although some of these distinctions are based on cardboard-cutout characterizations pulled from fantasy cliches such as the noble barbarian and the covetous dwarf.', 'Everything gets nastier as the game goes along. Cassia is regularly given the option to be extra dastardly through choices in which you can threaten prisoners, okay massacres, set up seductions, and hang prisoners after a battle because you don\'t want to spend any money on keeping them alive. That said, the main plot is something of a letdown. While Cassia and the other lead characters are certainly memorable, they are not particularly well-rounded. Too much is left unexplained, and even the story quests are convoluted. The main quest deals with something called the Melodies of the Creators, which are used to control monsters. Who are these Creators? What\'s their deal? Well, they\'re an ""alliance of chimerologists,"" of course. Everything clear yet? The more the characters talk, the more obscure everything becomes.', 'Daedalic Entertainment taps right into the evil vein with a deliciously dark tale that glories in such black-hatted pastimes as taking slaves, okaying battlefield massacres, and hanging prisoners as a cost-effective alternative to feeding them.', 'One area where Blackguards 2 is crystal clear is its mechanics. The game is centered on the traditional tactical RPG formula in which you assemble a party of adventurers, buff them with various skills, spells, weapons, and gear, and then tackle a couple of dozen locales on a main world map en route to taking down Marwan. The progression is generally linear, with you choosing the next town or site to attack based on a brief description featuring its challenge rating and some basic information about what will be found there. Actual conquering, of course, is done through battles staged on turn-based maps laid out in hex grids similar to those found in games of similar ilk, from Heroes of Might and Magic through Disciples.', ""So, there isn't much originality here, although everything has been extremely well done. The basics of gameplay are acceptably basic. Characters come with three core skills in vitality, endurance, and astral, with only the latter needing a bit of added explanation (think mana). All of the menu screens are intuitive, so anyone with even the slightest bit of roleplaying experience will quickly be able to figure out the lay of the land here. The only misstep comes with the paper doll interface used for equipping characters, as there seems to be no easy way to compare weapons and armor to quickly determine whether you need to swap out gear for better stats."", ""The sole bit of complexity in Blackguards 2 comes right where it is needed, with extensive character customization options. Everything here is pretty much wide open. The system is entirely based on Adventure Points earned in combat. Accumulate these in battle, then take a break back in the static town menu screen hubs to spend them on five core skill groupings--weapon talents, skill talents, spells, special maneuvers, and special abilities. There are no classes or rigid levels; just a whole lot of choices that let you freewheel when it comes to crafting villains. Again, there isn't anything here that reinvents the wheel. Skills include the usual RPG amenities like dual-wielding, armor wearing, powerhouse blows, and ability buffs. The spellbook is loaded with standards that let you throw around fireballs, launch lightning bolts, toss up magic shields, and so forth. About the only tip to originality comes from some of the names. Lightning Find You! and Witch's Spit may have familiar effects, but at least their names haven't been cribbed from the usual Gary Gygax playbook."", 'Battles are equally well crafted. The battle-arena maps are cunningly crafted and the opposition is drawn from a range of human adventurer types and monsters. As with the story, the maps are dark, ominous, and leave a lot unexplained, to the point that they seem somewhat puzzle-like. The look of the game is nicely gothic, with a dark color palette livened up only by magical explosions. Maps typically feature something to figure out, and this usually ties directly into how to wipe out your enemies. Taking a good look at your surroundings before even placing your troops, let alone starting any combat, is essential. You might need to determine the purpose of suspicious hanging bells (dammit, they summon reinforcements), what the deal is with oddly stacked crates (ah, you can topple them onto enemies), or simply gauge the best time to choose the better part of valor and run away from respawning thugs instead of trying to get to every loot chest in the vicinity. The only sore spot is the limited camera, which is difficult to position properly to see the action and is frequently blocked by parts of the level architecture.', ""The challenge is reasonable on all difficulty settings--easy means easy, hard means hard--and it ramps up in a smooth fashion that allows your skill to grow with the game. Loot drops and the availability of cool weapons, armor, and magical goodies in shops is also steadily stepped up. Item progression is handled beautifully, in that just enough new gear is doled out per battle to keep you interested, while never straying into overkill Monty Haul territory. Pace is the one flaw. Maps are large and most spells and weapons do only moderate damage at the best of times (especially in the early hours). This results in lengthy battles that can be frustrating, especially when you're steamrolling the opposition and victory is a foregone conclusion. Taking an extra 20 minutes to dispose of a bunch of half-naked slaves who are nothing but fireball fodder is a waste of time for all concerned. A leaner and meaner campaign would have been preferable to the somewhat padded 20 or so hours featured in the campaign as it stands."", 'Sometimes, bad is good. Blackguards 2 may start off as a something of a bad-guy gimmick, but it soon transcends the wow factor inspired by the dark gothic setting and the baleful protagonists. Come for the evil, stay for the brilliantly realized and addictive tactical game loaded with depth and challenge.']"Justin Clark,20-Jan-15,Saints Row IV Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/saints-row-iv-gat-out-of-hell-review/1900-6416007/,7,Xbox One & PS4,"[""Saints Row developer Volition loves Johnny Gat. Saints Row fans, in general, like Johnny, but Volition loves that psychopath, and it's been trying to share the love for three games now, only to have him overshadowed by the gang of puckish rogues we know today. In that way, Gat Out of Hell was almost a foregone conclusion. Johnny was always going to get his time in the solo spotlight and all Volition needed was a good excuse to get that band of rogues we've come to love so well over the last three Saints Row games out of the way so it could happen."", ""The irony is that when Gat Out Of Hell succeeds, it succeeds around Johnny, not because of him. He is more of a cipher than the player-created Boss. That's not because he's a bad character--he is slightly one-note here, and the storyline isn't doing the heavy lifting it does in the main game--but because Volition's obvious focus on world-building in Gat Out Of Hell is so strong. Virtually everything else small and character-based suffers as a result. This isn't necessarily the add-on you buy because you're looking for some sense of finality from these characters--How The Saints Saved Christmas actually managed to do more of that than anyone could have expected. You buy it because you're looking for one last jolt of wild, unhinged chaos from Saints Row in a brand spanking new playground, as the series as we know it moves onward and upward. Gat Out Of Hell delivers that, but it could have delivered so much more."", 'When the game starts, The Boss (who can be imported from your Saints Row IV saves) is kidnapped by Satan himself for an arranged marriage to his demonic Disney princess daughter, Jezebel. Without even thinking twice, Johnny and Kinzie jump through a gateway to Hell to come to The Boss\' rescue. Hell, in the Saints Row universe, feels like the unholy marriage of the nuclear, wind-blasted hellscape of the Keanu Reeves Constantine flick, and Biff Tannen\'s gaudy sleaze palace in Back to the Future II. It\'s about half the size of Steelport, but built entirely from scratch, and vastly more imaginative in its design. The humor is still persistent, with mean little passive aggressive jabs at its denizens on every street (a common billboard from Hell\'s ad bureau simply says ""If we\'re being honest, this is all your fault.""), but the city succeeds at bringing a broken, high-rising verticality to the mix, where floating platforms, impractical architecture, and arcane artifacts jut out of every corner. With the added details granted by next-gen horsepower, it\'s possibly the most memorable town Volition\'s ever plopped us in.', ""You get every opportunity to enjoy that architecture, as the flight controls no longer have you gliding through the air like a gun-toting flying squirrel, but with full-on angel wings. It's got a lot in common with the Arkham titles in its approach to flight, with a right combination of dives, daredevil stunts, and split second timing needed to dart through the air above, around, and through gaps in buildings like, well, a boss. It's far more forgiving of mistakes, though, and you're able to get up to some breakneck, insane speeds in the process."", ""Much of Johnny and Kinzie's combat repertoire is copy-pasted straight from Saints Row IV, although Johnny does get his own special animations for some seriously brutal melee combos. Superpowers make their way back, with a few minor tweaks (Stomp now has a vacuum variant, Telekinesis gets swapped out for the ability to summon monsters to your aid, Blast can drain life instead of setting things, redundantly, on fire). There are no costume options for characters or guns this time around, but the guns are all insane enough to make up for the lack of customization, especially the seven hidden weapons based on the deadly sins. Everything has its own hellish twist, though the variety has taken a minor hit."", ""All of this is literally in aid of one thing: destroying everything. Where the freedom to wreak havoc was mostly just implied in previous games, Johnny and Kinzie's entire mission in this game is to get Satan's attention, and nothing gets Big Red to take notice more than murder, mayhem, and chaos. A lot has been brought over from Saints Rows past--Mayhem and Survival and variants on those two themes are a mainstay--but once again, Volition did take the time to make some improvements. Insurance Fraud, in particular, had started to become a slog, but the activity is now Torment Fraud, which now involves accelerating the pain and suffering of a poor derelict soul in order to get him out of Hell and back into the Almighty's good graces again ahead of schedule, all while Jane Austen narrates his hilarious life story. The Trail Blazing races now take full advantage of the flight ability, involving some ridiculously fun rides through claustrophobic caverns, alcoves, buildings, and 90-degree vertical climbs."", ' ', ""Earning new abilities is now done by activating a hidden glyph with your powers, and fending off waves of powerful enemies with nothing but that ability and your guns. Opening up gateways to teleport around Hell is done by activating glyphs in dark chasms scattered throughout Hell, fending off numerous high-powered demons before a Legionnaire mini-boss demon shows up. The best new mini-game involves trying to prevent falling souls from getting into Satan's hands before they hit hellish ground, so Johnny/Kinzie have to snatch them up in midair. It feels like a side mission from a Superman game we never got, and plays better than any Superman game ever did."", ""Aside from a repetitive new King of the Hill activity, all the activities are still as fun as ever. The issue is, well, that's it. While normally there are campaign missions guiding the madness in a particular direction, with the side missions there to speed up ability development, here, it's the entirety of the game, other than an occasional side mission to rescue some of Hell's more infamous inhabitants along the way. Therein lies the biggest problem with Gat Out of Hell: Those inhabitants--namely William Shakespeare, Vlad The Impaler, Blackbeard, and the DeWynter Twins from Saints Row: The Third--are set up as major helper characters whose assistance you'll need to cause the most ruin during your time in hell. What you'll get are a few nifty bits of historical fan fiction--in which Shakespeare became Satan's spymaster general and Vlad The Impaler's castle in Hell ends up being turned into Hell's official frat house--and then being sent on, you guessed it, more side quests. Each figure has Loyalty Quests, and you keep waiting for the character-specific material that made Saints Row IV's Loyalty Quests absolutely imperative, but they never come. If the missions weren't as fun as they were, it'd be far more of an annoyance. The reality is that it just makes the expansion feel a little more watered down than its premise and its best ideas deserved. The DeWynters running a security company in Hell, and Shakespeare being beloved by Satan's daughter as a private tutor are absolutely ripe with ideas, and its disappointing to watch nothing come of them."", ""Sadly, this problem extends to the main storyline, where Johnny is trying to rescue The Boss from Satan's clutches. While the much ballyhooed musical sequence is a highlight, the game never capitalizes. Once Johnny and Kinzie have done enough to invoke Satan's Wrath (which literally, has a little meter in the menu screen), a cutscene triggers, allowing the story to continue, and all the best parts happen without your input. When Johnny finally gets to crash the fateful wedding, the best parts of it (a demon shootout, culminating in a certain tag-team move that's going to make many a wrestling fan grin ear to ear) happen during the cutscene, leaving only the final, irksome boss fight, leading to six short, amusing, but ultimately somewhat anticlimactic endings. The best part of the main story is Johnny and Kinzie being led by the nose by Dane Vogel, Ultor's dead CEO voiced by Jay Mohr, who gets to play a lot looser (and a lot more alcoholic) than in Saints Row 2. The expansion's best lines come from him, and he makes the tutorials a blast to live through; when the game finally shifts focus to the impending marriage at hand, his presence is missed. That's something that can be said much less about Johnny and Kinzie. Both are fun to hang out with in their own rights, but the expansion's truncated nature means we don't get nearly as much out of them as we want and need. It makes the expansion feel like a brief afternoon visit with old friends, as opposed to an epic send off, which wouldn't be expected of an expansion, but a premise this great warrants more than what we got."", ""Saints Row IVs current gen spit shine is enough of a cause for celebration, so the fact that Volition decided to throw in a new expansion to boot feels like an embarrassment of riches on principle alone. It's an expansion that leaves a lot to be desired, only because theres enough fertile ground to support a full blown game. It's the kind of expansion that gets you imagining what else this world and these characters are capable of, which is the best kind of disappointment you can have.""]"Kevin VanOrd,19-Jan-15,Resident Evil Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-hd-remastered-review/1900-6416006/,7,PS4,"[""Nostalgia is a tricky emotion to navigate, given how it makes the things we loved so many years ago blossom into legends of the recent past. Or to put it another way: the masterpiece we remember might have been mediocre all along. Sometimes it's better to live in the bliss of our memories and avoid replaying that dusty classic, lest it dump a heavy load of reality on the lovefest."", ""The trick that a modern re-release must perform, then, is to be like the game we remember rather than the game that actually was, and Resident Evil HD does so admirably. The downside of a successful transition is that it's easy to say that this remake of a remake looks just like 2002's GameCube version. In reality, of course, the newer game benefits from new background textures and some attractive light bloom, not to mention its widescreen aspect ratio. That it looks like your memories of a 13-year-old reality, and not the reality itself, is a victory."", ""Your other memories of 2002's remake, however, should be far more reliable. Resident Evil HD reveals the same mystery, surrounds you with the same areas, and requires you to solve the same puzzles, a slight disappointment given how the remake recontextualized the story and expanded the gameplay. Yet if any lesson is to be gained from Resident Evil 6, it's that you needn't mess with a good thing, and Resident Evil, even purely within a modern context, is an engrossing adventure that benefits from tense exploration and clever environmental puzzles. Much has been made of the series' scares: that moment at which zombified dogs leap through the hallway windows and viciously attack you is one of video gaming's most iconic moments, after all. Yet Resident Evil's finest asset is how it invigorates exploration by making every room you unlock an enigma. Behind every door are glimpses at the mansion's history, hints of experiments gone wrong, and bizarre contraptions coated with an occult veneer. Solving a puzzle is to wipe away some of the fog that obscures your understanding."", ""Don't get me wrong: the frights remain, though I suspect that you won't leap out of your seats as often as you'd expect, whether or not you've played Resident Evil before. These kinds of horror-story jump scares are a matter of routine in modern games and cinema, though the game still makes the most of them. I yelped when those dogs crashed through the glass, even though I knew they were coming. The fear didn't come just from the loud shattering and throaty snarls, but from knowing that I was defenseless for several crucial seconds once a set of jaws sunk into my forearm. And while the dogs get all the attention, the sharks swimming around an aquatic arena are even more terrifying given their extreme mobility. You can feel the tension as you quickly wade through the water, hoping to avoid the creatures snapping at your heels."", 'Resident Evil, even purely within a modern context, is an engrossing adventure that benefits from tense exploration and clever environmental puzzles.', ""If you're a total newcomer to Resident Evil, some background is in order. You play as either Jill Valentine or Chris Redfield, members of a special ops force called S.T.A.R.S. (The acronym stands for Special Tactics And Rescue Service.) You spend most of the game exploring a mansion in which you've become trapped while investigating the disappearances of other S.T.A.R.S. members, though it is soon clear that the fate you should most worry about is your own. Escape is your primary goal, but doing so means collecting and inspecting jewels and other doodads, and then figuring out where to put or how to combine those doodads. There is also the matter of those undead freaks roaming about, some of which are apt to return, stronger than ever, if you aren't careful enough to torch their corpses or land a blood-spattering headshot."", ""You don't freely control the camera during your endeavors. Every viewing angle enhances the claustrophobia while allowing Capcom to carefully place props and lights for maximum effect. Some of the most dangerous places are also given the most limited screen space: you hear the growl of a living corpse behind you, but all you see is the dingy carpet, the peeling wallpaper, and the door that leads to safety. You could move further into the room, but that also means moving closer to the source of the growls--and it takes a moment to aim your weapon, be it the pistol you start with or the more powerful firearms you find later. That specific camera angle has just activated the most primal of choices: to fight or to flee."", 'Elsewhere, the camera simply enhances the atmosphere. A hallway shot emphasizes the lushness of the mansion\'s drapes with a nearby lamp, yet cracked plates still keep you unsettled. The beauty of a waterfall is undercut by the squawking crows that descend upon you in the same scene; it\'s the handsomeness and hostility of nature at once. Resident Evil was created with a clear eye for shot composition, so you would be justified in calling the game ""cinematic."" The fixed camera can be a source of frustration, however. You are fleeing an enemy and the angle changes, barring your view and requiring a quick control adjustment. You must hurry to solve a puzzle before the sliding walls crush you between them, but the quick camera moves create confusion. With great tension sometimes come mild aggravation, whether you opt for the original controls or the updated scheme, which aligns the game with its modern counterparts.', ""Of course, that's the Resident Evil conundrum: mechanics that keep you nervous and cautious can also lead to a sense of wasted time. There's that limited inventory, which has you juggling items from your stash to your inventory and vice versa, and trudging back to the closest safe room when you don't happen to have the item you need on hand, or don't have any room for that healing herb you just found and so desperately need. There are those room transitions that feature door-opening animations each time. (Walk for three seconds, wait for three-second door animation, walk for another three seconds, wait for another three-second animation: it's a jerky rhythm that stops being charming and becomes tedious over time.)"", ""All the same, there's a beautiful simplicity to Resident Evil HD that serves as a reminder that the best mysteries don't need convoluted stories to be enthralling. Later Resident Evil games would add more viruses and unnecessary subplots, but the original allows that menacing mansion to do most of the talking. In this series, less is more. There is backstory to uncover, but the focus is on the here and now. Your motives are clear and your monstrous enemies are plain, and the scant cutscenes always serve a purpose. (The infrequency of cutscenes is just as well, given the high compression of those old audio files, not to mention the general awkwardness of the voice acting and dialogue.) It is you, the mansion, and your imagination. As it happens, that trio makes for a fine adventure, without the need for more monsters, more outbreaks, and more guns.""]"Don Saas,15-Jan-15,Kingdom Hearts HD 2.5 ReMIX Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/kingdom-hearts-2-5-hd-2-5-remix-review/1900-6416005/,7,PS3,"[""Early in the Kingdom Hearts 2.5 storyline, Sora, an idealistic boy rocketing out of childhood and into adolescence, says goodbye to a group of potential new friends as he waits to board a train that will shoot him off to the stars and into a grand new adventure. And although he's just met these ragtag teens who are dreading the end of their summer vacation and trying to score their next batch of sea salt ice cream, a single tear rolls down Sora's cheek as he waves farewell."", ""The moment shouldn't work. Its power rests on delving into the depths of a comically complex conspiracy tale involving metaphysical doppelgangers, simulated realities, and hyperbolic teen angst. But, the moment does work. In fact, the romantic, sincere innocence of Kingdom Hearts still carries an emotional punch, powerful on its own merits and just as affecting today as it was at its genesis."", ""Kingdom Hearts HD 2.5 Remix is a relic of childhood and early teenage blossoming for the many of us who came of age in the early- to mid-2000s. With a disc that contains Kingdom Hearts II (a 2005 PS2 game) and Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep (a 2010 PSP game) as well as Kingdom Hearts Re:Coded (a collection of the cutscenes from the 2008 mobile game), Remix is a nostalgic mix of storytelling and personality that stands tall nearly a decade after the oldest game's release. Built on the back of versatile combat, endearing characters, and enchanting forays into the Disney films, it's a shame that competent and enthralling plotting is so far out of reach for the main stories of any of the games."", 'After defeating the Heartless with the help of his friends Donald and Goofy at the end of Kingdom Hearts, Sora embarks on a quest to return home to his beloved Destiny Islands with his best friends Kairi and Riku. At the same time, he is dealing with the emergent threat of new soulless abominations known as Nobodies, who are doing the work of the mysterious cabal called Organization XIII. Sora and his friends travel from one Disney-themed world to the next (including Agrabah, the jungles of The Lion King, Halloween Town, and even the world of Pirates of the Caribbean) as he investigates the destruction wreaked by the Nobodies and tries to find his friends. Along the way, Sora learns a lesson or two about friendship, sacrifice, and growing up.', 'The romantic, sincere innocence of the Kingdom Hearts franchise still carries an emotional punch, powerful on its own merits.', 'Unlike the first game, where the Disney elements existed primarily to serve the overarching story, Kingdom Hearts II falters by doing the reverse. The trips to Disney-themed worlds--which are the raison d\'etre for the whole series--are mostly highly compressed, theme park versions of Disney films without the space for characters to breathe and grow as they do in the movies. And, more often than not, these levels have only the slightest bearing on the intentions or nature of Organization XIII, its relationship to Roxas, the boy whom you spend the first three hours of the game playing as, or the identity of the cowled DiZ. And while the strength of the source material (the emotional heft of Beauty and the Beast or the subversive strangeness of The Nightmare Before Christmas) carries you through most of these worlds, many feel like fun padding, particularly in the ""return to everywhere you\'ve already been"" back half. Throw in a story that is too byzantine for children to follow and too impersonal for adults to invest themselves in, and Kingdom Hearts II lacks the guilty-pleasure fun narrative of the first game.', ""And that's a pity, because despite itself, Kingdom Hearts II delivers enough moments of simple but piercing emotion to fill any game of its length. Towards the end of his adventure, Sora returns to the Hundred Acre Woods to say goodbye to the corpulent, half-dressed bear, Winnie the Pooh. Winnie had forgotten their friendship as well as his friendships with the nervous Piglet, hyperactive Tigger, and neurotic Rabbit. But through the bonds of caring and friendship, Pooh's memories return and as Sora prepares to leave, Pooh wishes for a way to make Sora stay and remain his friend. Sora promises the disappointed bear that he'll return, but Sora will always remain in his heart and memories."", ""It's a tired trope of children's storytelling, but its delivery feels authentic, evoking memories of being a child and saying goodbye to friends who move away. And, unlike the bombastic main plot, it doesn't wave its arms around, drawing attention to itself. There are games being released today with aesthetics or mechanics meant to appeal to children, but other than Ni No Kuni, it's rare for a game to evoke what it feels like to be a child. But in the moment with Pooh, the goodbye in the train station, long-awaited reunions, and shocking farewells, Kingdom Hearts radiates the purity and heart that is its redemption."", ""It's a shame that competent and enthralling plotting is so far out of reach for the main stories."", ""A sizeable improvement over the first game, Kingdom Heart II's combat is elegant while also offering a suite of ways for you to customize your style. Real-time combat sees you attacking, blocking, jumping, and activating special reaction commands. But with a host of equippable spells and a socketed ability system akin to Final Fantasy IX, you can outfit Sora with ways to boost his speed, magic, and strength to your liking and equip Donald, Goofy, and Disney heroes including Mulan, Hercules, Simba, and the Beast to complement your style of play. Combat may boil down to mashing the attack button while occasionally blocking or dodging, but the screen explodes with flashy effects to make every strike of the keyblade carry weight and pop. And although it clearly reaches out to the kid in all of us, Kingdom Hearts II can be unforgivingly difficult; on a handful of occasions, the game reaches a brutal Dark Souls level of difficulty."", ""Beyond the transition to HD, Square Enix has touched up many of the visual elements of the game. And in the worlds/areas that are the most stylized, abstract, and exaggerated, Kingdom Hearts II manages to look as good as many games on the current market. Whether it's the gothic interiors of the Beast's castle, the clean geometric cyberpunk lines of the world of Tron, or a free running course on the pages of the Winnie the Pooh book itself, the game shows off a vibrant art design whose expert use of color and cartoon style invites the imagination to lose itself in this world. On the other hand, areas that weren't touched up or draw attention to their low polygon count and muddy textures look even uglier in comparison."", ""The game also supplies hours and hours of extra content for you to dive into. The first games Olympus Coliseum arena battles return with a dark, Hades-themed spin. Emblems are scattered on nearly every world, inviting you to tackle extra-difficult versions of Organization XIII foes. Hidden puzzle pieces can be found in the hard-to-reach corners of the worlds, leading into a simple but rewarding jigsaw puzzle mini-game. It's fun to watch your pictures slowly come into focus with each trip to each new world.

A prequel to the first game, Birth by Sleep follows three young students of a Keyblade master as they investigate invasions by beings called the Unversed into worlds that have yet to experience Heartless or Nobodies. Each character has an individual story which is played to completion, at which point you can choose to finish the journey of one of the others.', ""Lead characters Terra, Aqua, and Ventus lack the charms of Sora, Donald, and Goofy, although Ventus comes the closest of any of them to bringing back that playful joy. Terra becomes a painfully cliche troubled, navel-gazing teenage JRPG protagonist and Aqua's arc is purely reactive to the actions of Terra and Ventus. Ventus, at least, smiles and acts like he's actually his character's age. And the story itself is focused, with only a few trivial excursions just for Disney's sake, although by the end it mostly serves to set up the events of the first two main games."", ""What makes Birth by Sleep stand out is its combat system. Without sacrificing the simple controls of Kingdom Hearts II's combat, Birth by Sleep ups the number of ways you can control your character. By removing a hotbar for spells and locking every ability to a single button, it makes it easy to switch equipped abilities on the fly rather than struggling through menus in real time. The abilities that are equipped can be leveled up and fused with other leveled up abilities to create new powers. Equipped abilities can be employed in general orders to activate powerful finish command styles;between deciding which abilities to equip/make and choosing which command styles to deploy, you never feel forced into one specific style of play."", ""While neither game will win awards for its narrative, playing both and adjusting your play style to whichever task you have at hand is always a blast. Re:Coded is the only true bust on the disc, a collection of re-tooled cutscenes, and for two of the three hours that you sit through the game, it's difficult to name a reason to justify its existence. It begins as a glitched out sci-fi simulation of the events of the first game, and although it does evolve past that, sitting through it is a chore even for those most dedicated to the Kingdom Hearts lore. Still, with dozens of hours of either of the other two games, it's hard to be too upset."", ""The last ten years have taken a toll on this franchise, and it's easy to fear that Kingdom Hearts III will fall prey to the unnecessary mental gymnastics Kingdom Hearts II required, but those last ten years have also made it easier to appreciate how warm and inviting these games are.

Dead Kings, the first downloadable content for Assassin's Creed Unity, is an unfortunate example of the perils of taking the beaten path and the design bugs that go with it. So it's a minor blessing that protagonist Arno Dorian returns without a thirst for vengeance or a love interest to protect, his two motivations from the main game. All he wants to do is leave late 18th century Paris...almost as much as I do."", 'It is from a ""one last heist"" premise that Dead Kings springs forth. Without the need for money or emotional attachments to complicate the situation, Arno comes into the job as a brooding ex-assassin who just wants to get away from all the dark memories of his time in the city. This is also why Dead Kings is set in the Parisian suburb of Saint-Denis rather than in Paris proper. Safe passage to Egypt is Arno\'s reward; all he has to do is find a manuscript and solve several tomb puzzles. One would think that a ticket from Paris to Egypt would be less complicated, but it wouldn\'t be much of a game if Arno just spent a day pickpocketing for boat fare, now would it?', ""The sight of a new set of vertical bars in the Progress Tracker provides an initial (and irrational) hope that Dead Kings might aspire to more than the usual half dozen story missions expected from Ubisoft's post-release add-ons. Suppress your enthusiasm early: aside from one bar devoted to tracking the six main assignments, the other columns represent an unremarkable swath of optional missions and collectable trackers."", ""Dead Kings is a wholly unsurprising sampler pack of many of the mission types from Assassin's Creed Unity, right down to the easy-to-solve environmental puzzles. Tailing objectives are painless, as are the foot chases, which both benefit from thick urban designs. As one who was indifferent to the much flaunted crowd densities of Assassin's Creed Unity, I greatly preferred maintaining pursuits from rooftop to rooftop even if my target was on the street. A combination of patience, guard patrol observations, and an ample supply of stealth gear ensures that you can clear a few missions completely undetected, if that's your preference."", ""If you guessed that the title Dead Kings implies that tombs are to be raided, then you are absolutely correct. Much as in the search for the Well of the Souls in Raiders of the Lost Ark, you have an advantage over the looters desecrating catacombs for treasure. Dr. Jones had better information than the Nazis; Arno has wall climbing skills, which is all he needs to get ahead of the Raiders, the new faction of this DLC. They're not an especially bright bunch. In fact, compared to elite guards, alley gangs, and other factions from prior Assassin's Creeds, the Raiders are no more than annoying thugs with longer lifebars."", ""As if to recognize that we may not have patience for these bullies, Ubisoft included one of the most useful and potent weapons in franchise history: the Guillotine Gun. If you can buy into the absurdity of the Animus, then you wont laugh when I tell you that I assumed that this weapon would fire wide guillotine-inspired blades, like a primitive version of the plasma cutter from Dead Space. The reality is less novel, more practical, and resoundingly brutal. The Guillotine Gun is a bayonet on steroids; two blade swings can take down brutes and the firing mechanism functions as either a grenade or mortar launcher, depending on the distance. As with any high damage weapon in the series, dealing death is utterly satisfying, provided you don't get caught in the blast of your own gunfire."", ""The completion of a campaign should leave you with the sensation of a job well done. It should not leave you with the relief of knowing that you won't have to endure another second of a mediocre game. I experienced the latter during my playthrough of Assassin's Creed Unity and had similar impressions of Dead Kings, albeit in a slightly more tolerable bite-sized package. This new content is best experienced by those who have yet to complete the main story, since the Guillotine Gun is a sufficient stress relief tool for coping with Unity's glitches (although you will experience the story out of sequence). As much as I appreciated the shift away from the crime investigation premise of Assassin's Creed Unity, sending Arno on a mere fetch quest turns Dead Kings into the blandest kind of open-world adventure, in which a man who used to be a hero is reduced to a mere errand boy."", ' ']"Kevin VanOrd,7-Jan-15,Lost Constellation Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/lost-constellation-review/1900-6416003/,8,PC,"[""The storyteller's art involves more than simply repeating tall tales of old, or reciting scripts that have been committed to memory.

Interactions are simple: you gather snowballs and throw them, build and customize charming snowmen, and speak with the delightful denizens of the woods you travel through. The simplicity complements the story, stressing the graceful snippets of dialogue with object collection and chime-ringing. Lost Constellation is not so much about ""what,"" however, than it is about ""where"" and who.""', 'The ""where"" is a forest of wintry beauty. The trees grow towards the heaven as you watch, rising from their current infinity to an even greater infinity, if such a thing were possible. You enter a coffin salesman\'s hut, and the background peels away, leaving you to bask in the warmth of the tiny cottage. It\'s such a small but meaningful detail, the way the falling snow dissipates and you are left with the orange glow of a cast iron stove and the comforting presence of a pipe-smoking fox resting in a rather cozy coffin. The ""who"" is a funny and diverse bunch, from a royal troupe seeking audience with a spirit, to a rat forced to confront her own wickedness. Lost Constellation\'s surreal soul, however, emanates from those snowpeople you build, who come to house the lost spirits of the wood.', ' ', 'The question of ""why"" still lingers when Lost Constellation draws to a close, but by then, it has fulfilled its purpose admirably, not just as a brief adventure, but as a companion piece to the developer\'s forthcoming Night in the Woods, a more expansive game set in the same universe. The game\'s clearest and most human sentiment accompanies that finale, at which point it muses on how we seek connections to the things we least understand--a suitable conviction for a story with such free-associative ideas and dreamlike tangents. To play Lost Constellation is to wrap yourself in a fleece blanket and shelter yourself from the cold.']"Heidi Kemps,6-Jan-15,Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/persona-q-shadow-of-the-labyrinth-review/1900-6416001/,8,3DS,"[""A defining moment of Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth comes at the end of the second dungeon. Throughout the five floors, in between random battles, dodging damage floors, evading high-level enemies, and drawing a detailed map of places you've been, you are asked to answer questions about what you want in an ideal partner. Lo and behold, right before the penultimate dungeon boss, I was plopped down into a flowery, fairytale-wedding wonderland with Marie, a mysterious, bitter girl with a secret penchant for writing terrible poetry. As we progressed towards the boss, I was given the option of making all manner of cheesy, romantic gestures towards her for the sole purpose of watching her get adorably flustered. After defeating the boss--a disturbing, four-armed caricature of a minister--I exited back to the hub, only to find another piece of poetry Marie had tried to hide about her would-be marriage to me. It was then and there, with that ridiculous bit of character interaction, that my love for Persona Q blossomed."", 'Persona Q is a mix of the Persona series character interaction and the careful first-person labyrinth exploration of Etrian Odyssey. It takes place between the events of Persona 3 and Persona 4, uniting the casts of the two games in a strange alternative dimension that resembles the Yasogami High School festival. Everything about this world is off: the otherworldly shelter known as the Velvet Room is in shambles; time stalls like one never-ending day; the festival attractions have morphed into elaborate labyrinths filled with enemy shadows; and the only people from the bizarro Yasogami who pay any attention to the squads are the enigmatic--and unsurprisingly amnesiac--Zen and Rei, two students unknown even to the P4 team. Its up to this motley crew to challenge the dungeons and solve the mystery of the endless festival.', 'The first thing you notice about Persona Q is the visuals. While the interface and overall presentation are comfortably familiar to anyone who has spent time with Persona 3 or 4, the characters have been transformed into adorable caricatures. They might be more cartoony, but it doesnt mean that theyve lost their appeal. In many ways, these precocious polygon models are even more expressive than their pre-Persona Q counterparts. Its tremendous fun to watch the chibi cast members emote their way through the games various scenarios, including some truly absurd situations (like the would-be wedding) that are bound to make you smile.', 'The visuals go hand-in-hand with the games overall tone. The mainline Persona games strike an interesting balance between the serious and the comedic, with humorous scenarios lightening the tension after dramatic encounters. In Persona Q, the emphasis is firmly focused on the comedy end of the scale. Character traits and quirks are played up heavily (sometimes to the point of minor annoyance--yes, Chie likes meat, we get it), and putting both casts together allows the scenario writers to create fun interactions that werent possible before: Teddie trying (and failing miserably) to hit on the stone-cold Mitsuru; Kanji developing an intense affection for adorable Persona-using doggie Koromaru; and everyone in the game mocking poor Theodore. Thats not to say that there arent serious moments in the game--there are some touching exchanges, like Yukari talking with Rise and Fuuka about her character flaws, and them giving her a dose of harsh truth in reply--but the seriousness is relatively rare. Typical story sequences, optional side quests, and bonus scenes tend to portray the characters as adorable little goofballs, more than anything else.', 'But once you step foot into the first labyrinth, the Persona elements take a seat behind the Etrian Odyssey influence. These multi-floor, grid-based mazes are presented in first-person format (much like the original Persona, actually), and you can map the dungeon and its various hazards on the bottom screen by drawing and making notes with the stylus. The mapping element adds to the fun of exploration and the feeling of progress and completion. Theres even an onscreen indicator that tells you how much of the current floor you have yet to see, which intensifies that compulsive, completionist drive to find absolutely everything. The dungeons themselves are fun, too: a strange Alice-in-Wonderland labyrinth; a take on the ill-fated Group Date Cafe from Persona 4; a spooky Japanese-horror-film school/hospital; and so on.', 'Theyre no relaxing stroll, however. The maze halls are filled with mysteries, puzzles, traps, and hazards. Damage panels, collapsing floors, dead ends, hidden passages, treasure chests, and item collection spots are among the things you might encounter. Every so often, you run into character dialogue and story bits as well. While generally entertaining, these scenes are sometimes placed awkwardly, interrupting exploration just when youre getting into a groove.', 'These precocious polygon models are even more expressive than their pre-Persona Q counterparts.', 'Of course, these wouldnt be proper dungeons without enemy encounters. The combat interface here is pure Etrian Odyssey: you fight enemies from a first-person view, seeing your party members only during special attacks. You make menu-driven action choices for all of your characters in one go for each turn, watching the combat between you and your foes play out after youve entered in all your partys commands. Its markedly different from P3 and P4, where (depending on AI settings) each characters turn allowed them to be controlled individually. Because of this shift, the weakness-exploiting system of P3 and P4, which granted characters extra actions, has been changed into a boost system: by scoring critical hits and exploiting enemy weaknesses, characters enter a boost state that reduces skill costs to zero and allows them to act first on the next turn.', 'At first, combat seems a bit overwhelming--enemies hit hard, and your characters start out with very few usable skills. Soon after launching your dungeon-crawling escapades, you gain access to more Personas to utilize. Unlike P3 and P4, where only the lead character can change Personas, every character can equip a sub-Persona that grants them additional skills and status boosts--with the caveat that these Personas cannot be changed mid-fight. This can help characters cover weaknesses and augment their combat capabilities, but the inability to switch mid-fight means that you can sometimes find yourself in a battle with few, if any, effective skills on hand. In a pinch, you can also use extremely helpful navigator skills from Rise and Fuuka, depending on what Personas they have assigned, and provided you have enough energy in your gauge to do so.', 'At first, combat is tough. If youre unfortunate enough to run into some of the fiercer enemies that appear directly on the map--the dreaded FOEs--the first time you explore a floor, youre bound to regret it very, very quickly. The ever-present threat of the FOEs quickly becomes the biggest source of tension in the game, as they can usually down you within a few turns if they catch you unprepared. Fortunately, they also follow specific behavior patterns, and learning to recognize these patterns allows you to avoid them... unless you screw up, of course. When youre even mildly low on resources and eager to explore more, the question of Do I go back? Or do I run around some more and risk getting cornered and wiped out by a potential FOE lurking in the next room? is a real conundrum.', 'FOEs are extremely dangerous, but even the standard encounters are very rough if you dont use the combat system to its fullest. A few floors in, when youve started to get the hang of fighting, the combat never quite reaches the challenge level of some of Etrian Odysseys most harrowing random encounters. Particularly open to abuse are dark and light instant death spells, as many enemies have a weakness to either one or the other. (Naoto, who can access both skills naturally, quickly becomes one of the games most powerful party members as a result.) Finding the most effective skills and fusing them onto as many Personae as possible significantly reduces the challenge, though the scarceness of cash (and the Etrian Odyssey sell-dropped-loot-for-cash-but-you-have-limited-inventory system) can make the expensive process of Persona fusion a bit of a grind. Combat is enjoyable enough, but its not as much fun as the character interactions or the dungeon exploration process.', 'Once you step foot into the first labyrinth, the Persona elements take a seat behind the Etrian Odyssey influence.', 'Persona Q doesnt quite hit the peaks that Persona and Etrian Odyssey do on their own. It does, however, take some of the best elements of each game, blending them together into an immensely satisfying and lengthy RPG. Persona Q is proof that this series has the power to delight, surprise, and engage, no matter the form it takes.']"Miguel Concepcion,6-Jan-15,Kalimba Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/kalimba-review/1900-6416002/,7,Xbox One,"[""Kalimba is bereft of both filler and fat, an especially impressive feat for a game that forces you to control multiple characters at once. Unlike many platformers that let you get comfortable with a newly introduced gameplay mechanic across multiple stages, Kalimba's developer, Press Play, is perpetually eager to show you something new in every area. For example, one stage introduces character swapping, while another enlarges your heroes to four times their normal size. It's a notably streamlined approach, not only compared to other side-scrolling adventures, but also when measured against Press Play's prior platforming endeavors like Max: The Curse of Brotherhood."", ""Whether they be crystals, orbs, or emeralds, the malicious scattering of valuables is a time-honored adventure game premise. In Kalimba, the catalyst is an evil shaman, whose goal of disrupting the island setting's good vibes is simplistically akin to a bully kicking over someone elses sandcastle. Specifically, the shaman breaks up a totem into its separate animal parts, blanketing the island in darkness. The equally plain protagonist tasked with retrieving the totem pieces is called the Shaman Lady, essentially just a marker that travels throughout the stage select screen. The real heroes are the totems who traverse Kalimba's highly hazardous two-dimensional levels. You are told that the Shaman Lady controls these totems, but that single-sentence factoid is as unnecessary as the lady herself."", ""From the first stage, Kalimba looks like two platforming games split horizontally down the middle. The goal of getting to the other end of the level is straightforward enough; the challenge is that the halves are never alike and you're controlling two totem characters with a single control stick. With levels abundant in deadly pools of black lava (among other numerous dangers), learning to move one totem without endangering the other becomes quite the puzzling task."", ""Any sense of novelty from controlling two characters simultaneously is forgotten early in Kalimba with the introduction of color matching. As in Outland and Ikaruga, matching colors is essential, and touching conflicting colors with your totems fatal. You often have time to plan your next move, but there are numerous moments without this luxury. When both characters are launched from a cannon and sent flying through multiple screens filled with colored waterfalls, survival is only possible through adept color-matching character swaps, often in rapid succession. One of the stimulating joys of Kalimba is how it rewards presence of mind and the ability to think two or three steps ahead. But when you try to plan four or more steps ahead, you're penalized for being too clever. Consequently the temptation to outsmart a stage (and by extension, the developer) is ever-present."", ""When Press Play isn't trying to outsmart you with its level designs, the studio balances that fine line between cruelty and fairness. Kalimba's approach to retries isn't so antiquated that you start out with the standard issue three lives. You also don't have to worry about getting 100 coins or rings to gain additional lives. Instead, there are 70 item pickups in each stage; dying reduces a portion of those pickups. Perfection, which means keeping all 70 pickups, is rewarded handsomely with a gold totem, while poor performers are shamed with a deformed block of wood. No matter the result, getting to the end of a stage unlocks the next one. In a game that demands a lot for the highest awards, I admire Press Play's leniency, enabling subpar players to continue progress. Racking up double-digit deaths in a given area may make you cringe, but you'll smile as well. Like many other well-tuned platformers, Kalimba instills you with confidence that a perfect run is only a handful of retries away. And even after you've restored the land with a 100% gold totem pole, the taunting digits of friends' completion times and the drive to set new records will give you the incentive to revisit each level."", ""Patience is a prerequisite of all good platformers, but saintly patience is helpful when enduring Kalimba's couch co-op levels. Press Play wisely avoided the lazy route of merely repurposing the single-player levels, since giving each totem independent movement would make a playthrough too easy. With levels specifically designed for co-op, this mode is reminiscent of the same-screen co-op Super Mario Brothers games from the past few years, just slightly less hectic and with a lower risk of damaging relationships."", ""For all the engrossing elements that drew me to replay the same stages in the pursuit of perfection, I was surprised that I felt indifferent about many of Kalimba's features beyond gameplay itself. While the vibrancy of the art direction is pervasive, the colors are seldom complementary and lack cohesion. It was also difficult trying to get a handle on Hoebear the Metabear, the narrator and teacher who is meant to supplement the in-game hints. His blunt attempts at fourth-wall-breaking humor fall flat, as does his unperturbed attitude about some of your accomplishments. His laid-back demeanor is poignantly out of place and his casual attire makes him more suited as a Margaritaville tour guide than an island sage."", ""The few memorable visuals are the moments when characters, structures, and the user interface smoothly disintegrate into tiny triangles. Watching these triangles float around the screen conjures mental images of polygonal models from the PlayStation's early years, only now these shapes fly through Kalimba's environments with graceful fluidity."", ""The beauty of Kalimba is in its high replay value, even more so than the gratification of solving its platforming puzzles. A lifetime of experience in this genre might lead to a gold totem in your first attempt in a given stage, but don't be disappointed if such achievements are rare. Kalimba doesn't need to pad its overall play length with similarly-styled levels, because getting all 70 pickups without dying is a test in and of itself, especially when you have to keep your eyes on two characters simultaneously. From a multitasking standpoint, I could see skilled drummers quickly picking up on Kalimba's platforming depth."", ' ']"Don Saas,5-Jan-15,Scrolls Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/scrolls-review/1900-6416000/,7,PC,"[""My opponent is smart. After laying a laughable ambulatory eldritch owl creature on the board in her first round, she lulled me into a false sense of security by laying a warrior on the battlefield on her second turn. Sure, he can attack at every single turn, but he only hits for two damage and only has two health. He can wait. I already have a deranged cultist on the board that will kill her warrior on my next turn, but to be safe, I put a putrid shrine between my cultist and her warrior. But that eldritch creature gives her small army more resources with every turn, and she lays down a forest shrine that periodically heals her Nordic warriors. I can't kill the shrine in this turn, so I sacrifice a small bauble that would allow me to curse my opponents so I can play a ravenous zombie from my hand. In a couple of turns, she will regret not laying out more offensive weaponry."", 'Or so I thought. On her next turn, my fiendish opponent gave her warrior a magic ring, and suddenly his attacks hit harder. ""It\'s fine,"" I told myself. He still only had two health, and my cultist was going to kill his protection that turn, leaving my zombie free to tear him to shreds next time. I laid down a wolf. I had three attackers to her one. I killed the shrine only for my opponent to lay down a cheap scout, and then my troubles really began. She cast verdant magic, and suddenly, this simple peasant warrior had more health and was immune to my own necromancy. A couple of turns later (and more foolishness on my end), that single unit had health and attack in the double digits and was slaying my units whenever they entered the battle. I surrendered and congratulated my opponent on her clever play.', ' ', ""Scrolls, the latest game from Minecraft developer Mojang, is full of opportunities for stories like that. A potent mix of turn-based tactical strategy with collectable card games, Scrolls understands the basic quality needed for either genre to succeed: choice. Whether it's the hard-scrabble battles being fought on the 3X5 hexagonal grids that each army calls home or the painstaking decisions made in moment-to-moment card-drawing and laying, Scrolls forces players to make smart choices at each step of play or fail. You will fail a lot. Scrolls stakes its claim as one of the more difficult and complex games in the crowded CCG market, and unless you've already sunk countless hours into titles like Hearthstone or Magic the Gathering: Online, you can expect an arduous hike up this game's immense difficulty curve."", ""In Scrolls, players battle one another or the computer in a series of matches with decks of up to 50 cards. Players start with one deck--the Growth deck, which is a basic nature rush deck--but you can eventually unlock starting decks for all four of the game's main resources: Growth (nature/rush), Order (knights/buffing), Energy (machines/direct damage), and Decay (zombies/debuffing). Players generate resources and gain cards at each turn to lay their cards as units on their half of the game's grid. Units deal damage or proc magical effects to units in their row with exceptions for special ranged artillery units, which have a wider area of effect for their attacks at the sacrifice of complete immobility. The end goal is to destroy three of your opponent's idols, which are hidden at the back of each row. And you will likely swear uncontrollably, mostly in a good way, while doing it."", ""Part of what makes Scrolls so unforgiving is its resource system. Unlike Magic or Pokemon, which have dedicated cards that one sacrifices to slowly but surely play more powerful cards in your deck, or something like Hearthstone, which has an auto-resource generation system, Scrolls forces you to sacrifice cards in your hands to generate resources or to get two other cards. It's rare for a match to begin without both players sacrificing a card for resources. If your deck is constructed well, you'll have few cards that you'll want to let go of willingly. And while you have to keep sacrificing cards to get enough resources to play the best units in your hand, if you only sacrifice cards for resources, you're asking to end up top-decking against your opponent. Scrolls is not a game where top-decking is a sound strategy."", ""So a constant balance is struck between sacrificing for resources and sacrificing for cards. And the longer you play, the more times you'll see an opponent use a card that you thought was an easy sacrifice choice in a new and interesting manner and crush you. And you begin to recognize the situational value of each card in your hand. And that makes the choice of what to let go that much harder. But you have to let something go. If you don't sacrifice one way or another, your opponent will break away in resources or cards, and either one is a lethal advantage in Scrolls. The choices become agonizing because every choice you make has immediate and measurable consequences."", 'Scrolls would be difficult if that were the only quirk in its systems, but the grid combat itself is just as punishing, though significantly more tantalizing in its complexity. Units, with the exception of ranged artillery and structures, are laid on the grid, but they have freedom to move about it. Units also have countdowns that determine when they can attack and when they can simply hope to defend, although defense is perhaps the wrong word because units attacked during their opponents turn do not do any damage to their attackers. They simply have to endure the attack and hope that they can vanquish their abuser before its countdown resets.', 'Scrolls forces players to make smart choices at each step of play.', ""And if there are enough pieces on the board--it's very easy to simply be swarmed by your poor decisions and good draws/decisions by your opponent--Scrolls becomes akin to a game of chess. Do you place your strongest units at the back of the row to ensure that they remain in play, or do you put them in the front to shield your weaker units while putting your most powerful players at major risk? Do you throw intentional sacrifices on the board to force your opponent to waste turns attacking meaningless units? Matches are won and lost in the minutiae of troop placement, and mastering that system is as important as understanding the competing values of your cards."", ""Fortunately, Scrolls offers a large and substantive training mode to ease players into the game before you take on human opponents. Beyond the basic tutorials, the Trials challenges (of which there are dozens) teach you to think situationally about the game. The Trials range from Easy and Medium to Hard. The Easy Trials give the player stat bonuses and various other buffs/extra units to start matches. They are used for situating yourself with the Growth deck and help you unlock the other decks. They can still be lost if your draws are bad enough; no matter how tactically driven Scrolls is, there's still a random element to the game. But, by the time you finish all of the Easy Trials, you should understand the basic ebb and flow of Scrolls matches."", ""It's when you reach the Medium Trials that Scrolls brings out its claws and teaches you how to react to the odds being stacked against you. While you may occasionally get buffs in Medium trials, your opponents also get bonuses like extra units and their own enchantments. And you will play these trials over and over and over again until you solve the puzzle. And while the opponent's advantage may seem unfair, the lessons are invaluable. You learn how to deal with opponents with comical health stacks. You learn to eliminate units that generate other units first. Sometimes wins in Medium Trials seem as if they came down to pure luck, but that element is at play in all card games. Hard Trials are for only the most masochistic, as the computer's advantage is nigh insurmountable unless you are a top-tier Scrolls player."", 'Matches are won and lost in the minutiae of troop placement.', ""Scrolls is one of the best-looking games of its genre. When cards come into play, the units on the board transform from cards into the units themselves. And with a visual aesthetic that is drawn equally from Western and Eastern inspirations, Scrolls' character models recall the art style of Nickelodeon's The Legend of Korra with a touch of George R. R. Martin. Units have unique battle animations for attacks and will sprint across the board to attack their opponents. It's a small touch, but it adds to the feeling that your cards are waging a war on your behalf, and it removes from the abstraction of health points and damage boxes. When a hulking, carapaced blob tears through three of your units in one go, it feels more satisfying than a glowing card and flashy ephemera for damage ever could."", 'Another highly redeeming feature of the game is its minimal microtransaction model. Real money can be spent for ""shards,"" which allow you to buy things like preconstructed decks, individual cards, or entries into the game\'s ""drafting"" mode, Judgment. But there\'s a limit to how often money can be spent on shards, and there\'s almost no reason to ""pay to win"" in the first place. Even matches that you lose pay out a decent amount of gold, which can be used to buy anything you can buy shards with. The various Trials reward with gold as well upon completion. And in my time with the game, I had enough gold to enter Judgment three times, buy over half a dozen card packs, and purchase four of the six preconstructed decks. Shards also can\'t be spent on the random deck packs, further minimizing the advantage that wealthier players can accrue. Here\'s hoping that more CCGs follow Scrolls\' suit in this case.', ' ', ""For all the ways, then, that Scrolls rewards players who are willing to delve into the caverns of its mechanics and possibilities, it's a shame that the endgame is often such a drag. Scrolls matches are long. If neither player concedes and one opponent isn't squashing the other with a nasty rush deck, matches can last between 30 and 50 minutes. It's easy to tell when you're too far down to have any possibility of coming back. Many matches are won in the first five to seven turns, but if you have enough hope to struggle forward on the off chance you'll get the one card you need to survive, matches can drag on for an eternity as you and your opponent slowly pick away at each other's defenses. You know you aren't going to win, but you don't know it with enough certainty to throw in the towel. It ties into the game's countdown system, which keeps units from attacking at every turn, and while that adds a delicious layer of tactics to the early and mid-game, it manages to rob the endgame of that urgency. It's especially problematic when you and your opponent have so many units on the grid that neither of you has the mobility to execute complex strategies in the first place. It just becomes a repetitive slug fest."", ""The endgame isn't always a drag. I played in (and lost) a ranked match against a player running an Energy deck against my Decay deck. My deck was built around surviving to the endgame because I had a spell that would transform all of my creatures in play (which would, I hoped, be a lot by then) into re-animated husks with high damage that could attack immediately. And I could then play a creature that summoned more husks like that every two turns. But Energy decks revolve around area-of-effect ranged attacks and a ton of direct damage, and we were trading pieces back and forth for almost an hour until he played a spell three times in a row that wiped essentially my entire army off the board on the third go (a spell that attacks every unit connected together, which at that point in the game is every unit). It was a frustrating loss, but the match was thrilling from start to finish."", ' ', ""Scrolls also suffers from a handful of bugs. The most benign simply erases the attack/health/countdown information about the units on your screen unless you hover over the unit, though even that bug can cause serious headaches if you momentarily forget numbers and do bad math in your head. The more serious bugs require regular resets of the game because the game will simply refuse to connect you to Trials or to put you in the queue to participate in multiplayer ranked matches. They don't happen often, but they are far from rare. The matchmaking system is also somewhat disappointing, and there have been dozens of times where I've fought the same opponent multiple times in a row, which can be frustrating when the game consistently fails to match you with other players around your rank/rating."", ""Scrolls shouldn't be your introduction to collectable card games; Hearthstone serves that purpose far better. In fact, you should probably pop in Final Fantasy Tactics or Disgaea should you need a primer on Scrolls strategic concerns. But if you crave a challenge and a new type of CCG experience, Scrolls may fulfill that role. The community needs to grow, and some general balancing issues need to be addressed, but it's not hard to imagine Scrolls becoming the home of the most dedicated and talented of the CCG community.""]"Brittany Vincent,24-Dec-14,World of Warcraft Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/world-of-warcraft-warlords-of-draenor/1900-6415997/,8,PC,"[""Blizzards iconic World of Warcraft has been one of a handful of games that have endured in the massively multiplayer arena. While many highly-touted MMOGs have come and gone, World of Warcraft has lasted despite its tendency to rely on outdated mechanics and antiquated practices. Tens of millions have fell in love with the worlds of Azeroth and Outland, and the newly explorable realm, Draenor, proves equally appealing. Few other games offer that same sense of accomplishment you earn when completing a raid or finally receiving just that right piece of gear, and few have years' worth of quality content ready to absorb and stimulate you. When World of Warcraft gets a new expansion, it's a big deal."", ""Warlords of Draenor picks up right after the events of Mists of Pandaria, and has the game's latest big-nasty, Garrosh Hellscream, escaping from his confinement with the aid of a very large accomplice. He then travels back in time to Draenor, stops the Orcish clans from becoming corrupted, joins the Burning Legion, unites the clans into the Iron Horde, and realigns the Dark Portal to invade Azeroth. (As you might surmise, the Warlord of the Warsong is a very busy Orc indeed.) You play the role of an Alliance or Horde General, part of the force that drives the Iron Horde back through the gate. Warlords of Draenor opens with the most thrilling preamble since The Burning Crusade and the Legion's invasion of Azeroth, and in doing so, infuses the game with a sense of urgency that makes it feel like truly dire times."", ""Warlords of Draenor's complementary ties to The Burning Crusade are clear. It is, in many ways, an analog to the first expansion, but instead of Lord Kazzak opening the Dark Portal to Outland to release the Burning Legion into Azeroth, it is instead Garrosh unleashing the Iron Horde from a pristine Draenor. Warlords of Draenors deftly utilizes its thematic ties to previous events, offering an alternate universe that treats you to story elements that cleverly refer back to the entire series. Expect some mild confusion: This Draenor is an alternate Draenor and not actual Draenor Prime (which is Outland), and while the events that happened in previous expansions expansions actually did occur, they didn't occur on Draenor--or perhaps more precisely, they haven't yet occurred on Draenor. The in-game Draenor (as opposed to the Outland Draenor) exists 30 or so years before present-day Azeroth, because the Dark Portal can transcend both space and time. (Don't worry if you already feel lost; it's best to take it all in a little bit at a time until it makes sense.) Luckily, you can enjoy Warcraft lore whether you skim it or dive deeply, and if you haven't explored the original game and its first two expansions in great detail, you might wish to spend time with them, if only to enjoy all of Warlords of Draenor's delightful cameos and references."", 'This expansion doesnt only turn the lore on its head, though: there is plenty under the hood to be excited about. The ability and stat systems have been overhauled to squish the stats down into more palatable numbers and a set of useful abilities for each class. If you had a million health prior to the expansion, you might discover you only have 400,000 upon entering Warlords of Draenor. However, the stat readjustment applies to enemies as well, so you will still be as powerful as you were previously. It is undoubtedly cool to deal thousands of damage per second, but it takes little time to realize that ""hundreds"" is the new ""thousands,"" so you needn\'t worry about losing that sense of power that comes with the hard work of tailoring a character to your liking. Blizzard has also retired the superfluous stats of hit, expertise, dodge rating, and parry rating, thus streamlining the process of building a character even more. Abilities have been refined for each class to draw from a more useful pool, with fewer cooldowns and less crowd control, making gameplay more tactical than strategic in nature, with less emphasis on complex macros in an attempt to get players to spend more time playing and less time preparing. If you\'re a sporadic player, the new changes are welcome, as they minimize the commitment required to learn and absorb such a daunting amount of information. Fortunately, new characters can instantly level to 90, so anyone new to World of Warcraft can play with friends that have subscribed to the game for years, and veteran players have a fresh template upon which to experiment with new abilities and a new character.', 'Blizzard also has thankfully improved the visuals. All character models (save Blood Elves, Worgen, and Goblins) have received updates, and Blizzard is in the process of creating new models for enemies as well. Although World of Warcraft is still not a graphical powerhouse, the new models and textures make for a great compromise, enhancing the games aging visuals while still supporting an enormous range of systems. The graphical improvement is a bit haphazard in its current form though. The effect of the new models populating a world with many of the old is sometimes jarring, but more and models are scheduled to be improved, so this should not be a permanent gripe. Nonetheless, as graphical fidelity in other games increases at such a tremendous rate, it becomes harder and harder for World of Warcraft to counterbalance its aging looks with its charming aesthetic and enthralling adventuring.', ""Subtle improvements permeate the new expansion. The auction houses for each server have been consolidated into one entity, which makes searching for appropriate equipment less frustrating than before and widens item availability. The user interface, while staying the same as a whole, received a host of tweaks and upgrades to reduce frustration. It is great, for instance, to be able to finally label bags by item type and have treasures auto-sorted into them. Quest items now go in their own separate menu, so you never have to miss out on that 50th pair of leather pants just because something essential was in the way. Reagents can now be used in the bank, which is a huge plus, since it makes having to carry them around for long periods of time unnecessary. Given the importance of gear and items, it's wonderful to be able to spend less time organizing them and more time earning them."", ""Warlords of Draenors questing is notably more focused than with previous expansions. Although there are the typical collection quests, the quest UI changes get you into the meat of the game quicker than ever. The Dungeon Finder and player-vs.-player windows have been folded into the Group Finder, making it simple to find quests, dungeons, raids, or anything in between, thus eliminating a ton of the most frustrating aspects of WoW in one fell swoop. Blizzard has also expanded its phasing technology, allowing Draenor to appear quite different to each player, depending on their progress and story choices. Depending on your place in the story, you may see characters that have been long dead in other players' stories, though you still inhabit the same zone. The new garrison system uses phasing extensively, as each player-maintained garrison can only be seen by its owner or invited friends."", ""With all the changes laid out in Draenor, however, adventuring sticks to a familiar path. You log in, perform your dailies, then get to work for the various NPCs strewn throughout the land. Where things tend to diverge from the day-to-day workings of seasoned players are in raids and dungeons, if not drastically so. Raids have undergone a respectable facelift as far as difficulty goes, while still serving up satisfying encounters to seasoned vets. Dungeons automatically adjust individual difficulty levels depending on the number of players involved, and raids themselves range from casual to challenging. There's a system in place to ensure lower-level players can't accidentally sidle up into a higher-level dungeon they simply aren't ready for, and progression is tiered in a way that forces you to approach dungeons in a way that's fair for everyone. Loot drops have also been refined, ensuring hard-working raiders are rewarded with items they actually find useful rather than a bunch of trash or less-than-personal goodies for a one-size-fits-all series of frustrations."", ""Given the importance of gear and items, it's wonderful to be able to spend less time organizing them and more time earning them."", ""NPC awareness has never been one of World of Warcraft's strong suits; you might strut around upon a rainbow-colored tiger, brandishing high-level gear, and quest-givers might still talk to you in annoyance, as if you are a mere underlying in annoyance. In Warlords of Draenor, NPCs acknowledge you as a powerful hero, and your position as a General of the Horde or Alliance is rewarded by the aforementioned garrison system, which provides you with a large plot of land and the means to develop it. The initial garrison is fairly humble, but as you place more buildings and level them up, a collection of huts and tents transforms into a large fortress. Each building serves a purpose, with some serving to boost your profession or access the benefits of other profession, while some are just fun places to visit. Each building has its own unique impact on the world as well, activating quests once they have been built or upgraded. You eventually max out at 10 plots of land in your garrison, and with 21 buildings available, you must choose the proper ones to get the best benefits from your garrison. (Luckily, if you erect a building that doesn't suit you, you can demolish and replace it.) After the garrison reaches level two, you face keep invasions, although thankfully, invasions are not time-sensitive. It's easy to become attached to what amounts to your own little town, and you can find yourself spending more time collecting resources and attracting followers for your garrison than you do on the main quest line."", ""With a garrison come soldiers and staff, and you can also recruit a whole host of followers to command. As you journey across Draenor, you meet NPCs that can be recruited through meeting them, completing quests, earning achievements, or buying them from taverns. They come in three quality levels which determine their effectiveness: uncommon, rare, and epic, with the rarest of them requiring you to meet stringent prerequisites. Once followers make it to the garrison, they can be assigned to missions, or to work in one of the buildings. Each one possesses his or her own profession, items, and level, and you manage them through menus. You send your followers to quest, gather resources, and manufacture goods in their respective buildings, and use the same menu to collect the rewards. It's an adequate system, but with so much care put into the customization and building of your garrison, it's disappointing that you cannot accompany your followers on quests, help them work, or lead them into battle against another player in fortress-versus-fortress gameplay. For now, the garrison endgame lacks luster."", ' ', 'Warlords of Draenor has revitalized World of Warcraft with a huge amount of new content and refinement of the basic gameplay. Unlike the debacle of the New Game Enhancement of Star Wars Galaxies, Blizzard has not taken away anything with the stat changes, but instead finally fixed the stat inflation that had built with each expansion. For those new to World of Warcraft or those who have been around since the original release, Draenor feels like the beginning of a new era of the game. There are those who have said that World of Warcraft is on its way out, and that it is tired and old. Warlords of Draenor proves otherwise. Blizzards winning formula is not going anywhere.']"Miguel Concepcion,23-Dec-14,Sunset Overdrive Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sunset-overdrive-and-the-mystery-of-the-mooil-rig-/1900-6415999/,8,Xbox One,"['The better the game, the easier expansion packs can rely on a more-of-the-same approach (see Mass Effect 2 and Diablo III). Mystery of the Mooil Rig! is wholly effective in its series of nine missions, with objectives recognizable to those who have beaten Sunset Overdrive. Normally, I dislike being an errand boy in open world games, yet Im happy to engage in fetch quests in Mooil Rig, because each quest is succinctly designed and retains the same kind of comedic storytelling found in the main game.', 'Its hard to turn down assignments from one of the worlds more resilient and endearing quadriplegics. If youve played several hours of Sunset Overdrive, youll know Im talking about Brylcreem. The absence of arms and legs didnt stop him previously, and he remains the eternal optimist in the Mystery of the Mooil Rig. Now armed with a fortified exosuit, Brylcreem plays Colossus to the heros Wolverine, launching you toward key objectives, including a boss mouth. These scenes add thrilling forward movement; the more you hurtle at breakneck speeds, the more you want to keep going.', 'Add-ons to open world games either expand the maps with a new landmass (e.g., Burnout Paradises Big Surf Island, Forza Horizon 2s Storm Island) or conjure up new experiences within the current city (e.g., Watch Dogs: Bad Blood). The Mystery of the Mooil Rig opts for the former, with a sprawling oil rig primed for more perpetual grinding. Its an overly intricate off-shore base littered with life rafts, barges and other tiny landing points to help you avoid the water. With the exception of one occasionally lethal undersea creature, spending time in the ocean isnt a hazard at all. Like an energy drink-addicted version of Jesus, this expansion capitalizes on the main games speedy methods of unaided water traversal. Whether youre on or near the rig, the biggest rushes come from stringing together movement combos as you make your way to your next objective. The addition of two new water moves--a deep dive and an eye-catching high-flying uppercut--mean you can maintain movement combos for hundreds of yards in watery areas within Sunset City, not just the Mooil Rig. The upper cut--oddly named Water Slam Bounce--looks like a water-based Shoryuken, although I was unsuccessful in using it to attack flying foes. Its more practical as a method for reaching elevated parts of the rig.', 'If I were to describe Sunset Overdrives look and feel to someone who knows nothing about Insomniac Games latest hit, it would be bubblegum punk. The closest aesthetic relation I can come up with is Crazy Taxi, but even that Sega classic didnt saturate its visuals with this much fuchsia and neon green. Couple that with Sunset Overdrives grind-intensive gameplay. If its a railing or some semblance of a railing, you can grind on it. If it has an edge, you can grind on it. Somewhat like the adrenaline-fueled action film Crank, suspending forward movement often results in death. These situations are diciest when you have to protect stationary objects from invaders--it forces you to get creative with nearby grind points. Provided you mix up melee and ranged attacks, youd be surprised how long you can survive going back and forth on a 50-yard railing.', 'Those who love Sunset Overdrive already know how playing well creates a feedback loop within seemingly chaotic combat. Having a sliver of health is seldom a cause for concern, because you know that firing another explosive teddy bear is likely to yield a health pack, along with a high body count. The missions in the Mystery of the Mooil Rig are seldom short of such moments, so surviving them is all the more gratifying.', 'Insomniacs writers for Sunset Overdrive exude the chops of a revered, decades-old comedian, one who never laughs at his own jokes and knows to keep quips short and sweet. That includes avoiding the sin of over-explaining a punchline or the myriad pop culture references throughout the main game and this expansion. Even with a boss sporting multiple tentacles, the script wisely avoids hamfisted nods to Japanese erotica. Like the multi-generational appeal of Looney Tunes animated shorts, the Mystery of the Mooil Rig namedrops cultural allusions that many adolescents today wont pick up on, like a certain Alfred Hitchcock film with cross-dressing. One of the most memorable missions is a fetch quest for the versatile director Alan Smithee, whose name has been attached to many edited-for-TV movies dating back to the 1960s, a Metal Gear Solid trailer, and numerous voices in games like Eternal Sonata and Street Fighter X Tekken.', ' ', 'For all the risks Sunset Overdrive takes with its vibrant art direction and intuitive level design, the Mystery of the Mooil Rig is a fundamentally safe spin-off. Its impressively consistent with the main game, and enough that relearning the controls takes no time, even if you havent touched Sunset Overdrive since launch week. This user-friendliness leads to tight, concise story mission playthroughs that will be familiar to fans of the main game. Its not to say these objectives are easy. Theyre just short, a result of Insomniacs talent for creating scenarios trimmed of fat and devoid of filler.', ' ']"Cameron Woolsey,23-Dec-14,Loadout Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/loadout-review/1900-6415998/,7,PS4,"['Loadout feels good on the PlayStation 4. Its not just how well the game has adapted Sonys controller, but also that small changes have translated into some big differences. This free-to-play third-person shooter is all about collecting gun parts and crafting them into vicious weapons that lash out with fire, lightning, or spiked metal spheres--just as it was on the PC. But on the PlayStation 4, Loadout tries new things, completely revamping its method of distributing weapon parts that makes collecting them almost as exciting as constructing them into a vast array of deadly guns. Despite a lackluster campaign and a locked-out ranked mode, Loadout is a frantic and entertaining shooter on the PlayStation 4 and will keep you happy on your quest for loot, with a smile on your face and a numb trigger finger.', 'The highly craftable guns are the stars of the show, and the customizable loadouts set the stage. Abandoning traditional classes, Loadout instead offers a toybox that slowly fills with various gun parts that you can play with using its robust weaponcrafting menu. For instance, creating a powerful shotgun is as easy as snapping a scatter barrel and a shell-loading magazine onto a gun chassis. Swap that scatter barrel out for a Gatling barrel and strap on a high-capacity magazine to create a Gatling gun, and so on. Different ammo types kick things up a notch or two, and can make your weapon belch fire or send out a slap of electricity that sends chain lightning through a group of hapless foes. Not all ammo types are deadly: loading your gun with healing rounds transforms your weapon from a death dealer to a wound healer, and theres nothing wrong with wanting to be the team medic. Or, if youre feeling sneaky, you can use a gun with a silencer, and, using the disguise equipment, go undercover to infiltrate the opposing team and silently take them by surprise. And you might as well slap on a suit, mask, and tie from the outfitter store while youre at it, and become the spy Team Fortress 2 always knew you could be.', 'Earning parts in Loadout on PlayStation 4 is a much different experience than in the PC version of the game. On a PC, you unlock parts from daily prizes or in a tech tree by earning experience and spending blutes, Loadouts in-game currency awarded at the end of matches. On the PlayStation 4 edition, weapon parts, gear, and safes are often awarded at the end of finished multiplayer matches or campaign missions. Safes, which contain items of varying rarity, are opened with dynamite, which is bought with spacebux, Loadouts other currency that must be purchased with actual cash and not blutes, somewhat like the currency in Counter-Strike: Global Offensives weapon cases and keys. Parts are assigned levels, as well as a degree of rarity that moves from common to rare items. Rarer parts can grant optional attribute boosts, such as decreased reload times or additional health.', 'Comparing the two systems of delivering items, from the tech tree of the PC version to earning parts post-match on the PlayStation 4, I prefer the latter. Parts and gear come at a steady flow in Loadout on PlayStation 4, and I cant deny the giddy feeling of anticipation that grows just before opening each loot chest or safe filled with new toys to play with. You gain a lot of weapon parts as you progress, but not everything is worth keeping. The included fusion mechanic allows you to take a lower-tier item and merge it with other disposable parts to increase its potency. Its a great way to burn off extra junk you dont need, while making your weapons even stronger, all the while not spending any actual cash on upgrades yourself. And the upgrade is often quickly apparent, too; promoting that level three pyro rocket to level five or higher can mean the difference between leaving your foes medium rare or well done.', 'Crafting and naming your own custom weapon is a joy Ive rarely experienced in other online shooters. A machine gun with the offensive output of mosquito bites later roars as it rips flesh from bone. A feeble rocket launcher that evokes more laughs than screams evolves over time to become a frightening, two-hit kill monster that causes enemies to burst into flame--its enough to bring a tear to your eye.', 'The weak campaign mode, however, is a wet blanket that stifles some of that fire. There is no story to speak of, only five chapters with missions that consist of you fighting waves of AI-controlled alien baddies on the available multiplayer maps and gametypes. For at least a few missions, the campaign is passable, if not somewhat disappointing. But after playing through chapter after chapter of similar battles, the venture becomes tedious and dull. The only real incentive to play each campaign is tied into Loadouts new method of distributing loot. Campaign mode offers loot packs and safes that drop randomly as you play through a match, and that unfortunately means having to wade through the muck for some of those precious parts and equipment--some of which, like deployable health packs and jump boots, is awarded at the end of certain missions. At least collecting the extra loot in campaign is still enjoyable; its just the parts in between that are the issue.', 'The highly craftable guns are the stars of the show, and the customizable loadouts set the stage.', 'One additional positive about the campaign, however, is that it allows you to earn some additional spacebux without having to fork over any of your hard-earned cash. Currently, Loadout on PlayStation 4 is the only version to have the campaign included with the package. The PC version is set to have the currently separate campaign (now in beta) merged with the base game next year.', 'Thankfully, the core multiplayer experience is just as exhilarating and violent as ever, and it is here you spend most of your time. The controls adapt well to DualShock 4, though aiming does feel a little squirrelly when zoomed in--a problem that can be alleviated by lowering aim sensitivity. Other than that, Loadout plays exceptionally well on the controller; skirmishes havent lost an ounce of their raw intensity in the transfer from the keyboard and mouse. Across six varied maps that include deep crevasses, hidden pathways, and high ledges, you sprint, dive, and leap high into the air while raining fire on enemies above and below.', 'Loadouts action is ferocious, and each clash erupts in a chaotic frenzy of flying rockets, popping grenades, and neon lasers; the vibrant cartoon visuals are a colorful foil to the absurd violence onscreen. During battles, flesh is seared from bone, heads are blown apart to leave bouncing eyeballs and a brain, and somewhere in the fracas is a person thrusting their gun between their hips as a pair of disembodied legs run across the war-tattered field before collapsing. Loadout is often as hilarious as it is grotesque, leaving you vacillating between laughing at the slapstick insanity and cringing at the immense gore. And you know what? Its quite a lot of fun--though much of it is like a riding a rollercoaster through a whirlwind of bullets and body parts.', ' ', 'Multiplayer consists of four-on-four matches among five game types: blitz, death snatch, extraction, domination, and jackhammer. Blitz and domination are won by taking control points on a map, the latter of which has you fighting to control three points at once. Death snatch is Loadouts take on classic death match, and plays similar to Call of Dutys Kill Confirmed mode. In death snatch, dead opponents drop a vial of glowing blutes that must be snagged in order for the death to count as a kill. Extraction tasks each team with protecting a teammate who collects blutonium deposits and places them into marked grinders to score points. Finally, jackhammer is a mode similar to capture the flag, except the flag is a massive hammer that smashes enemies into itty bitty meaty chunks. You can kill up to five opponents, which adds extra points to your score when the hammer is claimed at your base.', 'There are two downsides to multiplayer; the most notable is the lack of the ranked mode, Annihilation, which is currently locked out with Coming Soon! written over it. Instead, you are left with the unranked arena, which performs rather poorly in terms of matching you with players of similar skill. You have an overall level that increases as you gain experience points earned after completing matches. However, that rank is effectively slashed in the arena, and you often find yourself paired with unskilled allies or against a team of seasoned players. I realize this is the caveat of any unranked multiplayer, but its incredibly frustrating to play a session consisting of about ten losses in a row due to unbalanced matchmaking. The other issue with multiplayer is that with only six maps, things soon slide into repetition. Having five game types does help deter some boredom, but after a dozen hours I was more than ready for a change in scenery. And just when will there be more than three customizable characters to choose from?', ' ', 'Loadout on PlayStation 4 is not without its issues, but overall it remains an energetic, madcap shooter with a violent sense of humor that delights as often as it disgusts. There are still tweaks to be made--the underwhelming campaign is the first that comes to mind--and, once released, the ranked mode will also greatly increase its value, which is a lot, considering that the game is already free of charge. Regardless, there is a lot of entertainment to be found in Loadout. The welcome new changes to earning gun parts will keep you killing, collecting, and customizing for many blood-soaked hours to come as the game continues to evolve, just like the many weapons that call it home.']"Britton Peele,19-Dec-14,Tetris Ultimate Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tetris-ultimate-review/1900-6415996/,7,Xbox One & PS4,"[""On the year of its 30th anniversary, it's hard to think of new things to say about Tetris. Few games even come close to being as universally recognized and understood as the Russian puzzle game that has caused countless people to dream about stacking blocks into perfect lines."", 'So as hard as it is simply to write something original about the classic, it must be harder to invent new and exciting ways in which to actually play it. As a result, just about every gaming platform under the sun (and even many non-gaming platforms--hello, graphing calculators) tends to end up with at least one or two new editions of the same old formula, maybe experimenting with a new mode or two but mostly sticking to what\'s tried and true. Ubisoft\'s crack at celebrating the series\' history falls into this exact trap, and Tetris Ultimate is mostly a game you can look at and say, ""Yep, that\'s Tetris.""', ' ', 'The basics are unchanged. You are given a vertical playing field in which you drop tetrominos--various shapes composed of four squares each. As a randomized parade of pieces falls from the top of the screen one at a time, you can move each one left or right as well as rotate it clockwise or counterclockwise. The goal is to create a straight, unbroken horizontal line of blocks, which removes the line from the playing field and scores you points (more points if you can eliminate several lines at once). The more lines you clear, the faster the game becomes.', 'Over three decades, this formula has remained largely unchanged, and rarely have the rules been so much as tweaked. But while there are no options to customize the look or sound of the game, Tetris Ultimate sports an admirable list of settings that let you tailor the feel of the game to your liking. For instance, you can turn off the hold queue (which allows you to save a piece for later use), change the behavior of the random generator, or turn off the more advanced wall kick and t-spin maneuvers. You can also tweak how long you can rotate a piece at the bottom of its drop--the controversial ""easy"" or infinite spin is not a default. You can\'t get super specific with these values, but the options are nice to have regardless.', ""While the potential variety of Tetris may seem limited, previous iterations of the series have nonetheless seen some rather inventive new modes using tetrominos. By comparison, Tetris Ultimate's mode selection is bare-bones. In addition to your standard marathon and endless modes there's Sprint (a race to see how quickly you can clear 40 lines), Ultra (a high-score challenge where you only have three minutes to play), and a couple of multiplayer-only battle modes--one with power-ups and one without. All modes can be played with humans or bots, with team versus team and co-op variations of each."", ""Co-op and team modes are the most interesting twists on the Tetris formula, as they widen the playing area (and thus lengthen the width you need to cover to get a line) and divide the screen up so that each player has his or her own designated section to drop pieces into, with a couple of columns of shared space in between that both players can use. Communication becomes important not only because scoring is impossible alone but also because all players on a team share both the pool of upcoming pieces as well as the single held piece, so if you're saving that straight block for a specific purpose, make sure your partners don't use it themselves."", 'While there are no options to customize the look or sound of the game, Tetris Ultimate sports an admirable list of settings that let you tailor the feel of the game to your liking.', 'When playing online, there doesn\'t seem to be a great system for matchmaking similarly skilled players. The only ""rank"" you ever achieve is designated by how far you are able to get in either the marathon or endless mode. But playing vanilla Tetris without interference is quite a different beast from a battle mode match against another player, and this doesn\'t appear to be a consideration when matching players together. Furthermore, many matches are hit with unfortunate lags and/or bugs, and if the game\'s host disconnects for any reason, the other players are out of luck even if they\'re 14 levels deep in a marathon game.', 'If you don\'t want to put up with the occasional lag that comes from playing against strangers, you can pretend to play against your friends by challenging their ""Tetris Self,"" a bot that tries to play at about the same skill level as its player. It\'s an interesting idea, but it doesn\'t feel any more special than playing against an AI with a custom name--which is all this is.', ' ', ""When playing alone or in offline multiplayer mode, Tetris Ultimate nails most of the basics. Unfortunately, it doesn't go far beyond them. The four-player versus and co-op modes are a lot of fun, and the classic high-score chase is as solid as ever, but there are no visual or music options, and the selection of modes feels lacking. To be fair, at $10, Tetris Ultimate is one of the cheaper Tetris games to hit consoles in recent years, and what you get for that price is perfectly competent. The game's main menu features a prominent store icon that promises more modes coming soon, so those looking for more variety may get what they're looking for via DLC."", 'Part solid execution and part missed opportunity, Tetris Ultimate is hard to judge. If all you want is a good version of classic Tetris for your new console, this one will suit your needs well. The low price is nice and the gameplay options provided are a nice touch, but it doesn\'t do enough to earn the ""ultimate"" moniker.']"Brett Todd,19-Dec-14,Tropico 5 Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tropico-5-waterborne/1900-6415995/,5,PC,"[""It may be as revolutionary as a hipster in a Che Guevara t-shirt. A lack of originality means that Tropico 5: Waterborne doesn't wring much more life out of the latest edition of Haemimont Games' dictator-in-a-box city builder. Much like the main game, which slightly stretched the familiar Tropico formula with new historical eras and nastier politics, this expansion barely broadens El Presidente's possibilities with a series of glub-glub gimmicks that lets you take Caribbean corruption into the actual Caribbean. Enough new content is provided with a new campaign, buildings, and window dressing to get diehard fans of the original game interested for a couple of days, but there isn't anything essential here, and the $20 pricetag is a little steep."", ""The premise is pretty simple. El Presidente decides that being the boss of a banana republic isn't satisfying enough, so he goes the Bond villain route and heads to the sea. Quicker than you can wonder why every other 007 bad guy in the 60s and 70s seemed to have some kind of watery HQ complete with submarines and pet sharks, you're expanding your tropical dictatorship from the traditional island jungles out onto the waves. All of this wet and wild action comes in the form of a new Lord of the Pearl campaign centred on the various kooky oceanic activities necessary to secure the legendary Black Pearl. Forget about giving out any brownie points for originality."", ""Most of the new campaign storylines and quests focus on the high seas, although there isn't anything here all that interesting, save the odd geeky reference to things like discovering R'lyeh and then sending good old Penultimo off to meet with Cthulhu. Unfortunately, the developers don't do too much with these out-there plot points. At the very least, they could have had the simpering toady devoured. That said, sending canned goods to R'lyeh for the bonus of importing what have to be Deep One immigrants is kind of nifty, even if there isn't anything here beyond the textual references. Still, the goofy sense of humor on offer in Tropico 5 is strongly present, adding chuckles to the yawns. This remains a charming and very likeable experience thanks to cornball humor, the great radio broadcaster, and the fantastic soundtrack with its peppy Latin beats and guitar plucks."", ""The campaign is something of a snoozefest. Waterborne scenarios play out pretty much exactly like they did in the original Tropico 5, with you continually being pushed along from one directed goal to another, given various trade quotas, and so forth. A stream of advisors and flunkies shows up basically to give you orders about exporting this or that resource, building this or that facility to please the great unwashed, dishing out an edict to please a foreign power or suck up to an island faction, and so forth. The only difference is the watery flavour of the plot, although it really doesn't make much difference if you're trudging through the same old goals on land or on the high seas. Dull is dull."", ""New game mechanics are few and far between. There is a paltry number of new facilities to construct, none of which is any sort of stop-the-presses addition to gameplay. You can now set up oyster farms to gather pearls, which can be a hot commodity on the export market. Smuggler's docks let you play up to pirates and open up black-market trade routes, but at the cost of occasionally being invaded by gangs of pirates that do little but expose the chaos of the core game's combat system."", ""Some of these features get a little more interesting as the years fly by, but even then, there isn't much to recommend such amenities as the glass-bottom boat, tidal power plants, bathysphere, and floating apartments. You can build nuclear subs in the modern era, at least, although these aren't exactly a show-stopper given the poor combat features of the core game. Most of the new features are minor variations on existing buildings that add nothing aside from a nautical flavour to your dictatorship. About the one positive is that there is something for everyone here. The new water-based structures feature in every aspect of your city-building, from core infrastructure like food production to tourism to military defense. They do add a sprinkling of variety that should liven up sandbox games."", ""Combine Popeye with Papa Doc, stir in the usual city-building procedures of Tropico 5, and you've got Waterborne, an expansion short on imagination and implementation. Nothing here adds any meaningful content to a game that was already pretty well-known to long-time followers of the franchise. Another half-dozen or so hours of peasant-oppressing, Swiss Bank-building fun is provided for the truly dedicated, but there isn't anything here with lasting value or appeal."", ' ']"Kevin VanOrd,17-Dec-14,Elegy for a Dead World Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elegy-for-a-dead-world-review/1900-6415994/,7,PC,"['""What is Elegy for a Dead World?"" you might ask, though the answer is as ephemeral as understanding particle/wave duality, or describing love to one who has never felt it. It is an interactive writing tool and an exploration game that provides no answers and expects you to supply them. It is a complex game of Mad Libs in which you enter some, many, or all words to the story you wish to tell about the otherworldly panoramas before you. And, if you like to write but frequently find yourself at a loss for words, it is a muse, poking and prompting you to put your fingers against the keyboard and let your voice be heard.', 'You may think of a muse as an ethereal goddess who blesses you with magical inspiration, but as any creator knows, this is not the muse\'s modus operandi. Says Stephen King in On Writing, ""You have to do all the grunt labor, in other words, while the muse sits and smokes cigars and admires his bowling trophies and pretends to ignore you."" Elegy for a Dead World is your cigar-smoking fairy. It invites you into one of three landscapes, which you access via a central screen that shows you hovering in front of a rotating nebula of purple and pink. ""You,"" in this case, is a helmeted astronaut of indeterminate age and indeterminate gender. This wanderer of the cosmos may indeed represent you, or may instead represent someone or something else, entirely a product of your imagination. The figure\'s anonymity is vital to Elegy for a Dead World\'s success, for the stories you create allow you to assign it any role you wish.', 'And so you seek your muse in one of those worlds, which you walk or float across in two dimensions. One world is characterized by its red and orange skies, temples lit by glowing candles, and structures that frame the nighttime moon, which dominates the heavens. In the next, the remnants of past labor prevail. You pass by hovels and machines as you move forward, and suddenly another edifice looms large--a university, or perhaps a courthouse. The remaining world is blessed by life; upon entering, a cyclopic gazelle grazes in front of a colossal sculpture depicting three giants bearing the burden of an entire planet upon their shoulders. You may wonder what secrets this trio of kingdoms might harbor, but it is not for the game to supply them.', 'No--illuminating secrets is your role. Elegy for a Dead World provides you a structure, and then sits back and waits, smoking cigars while you do the work. Before entering a world, you choose the framework for your story. A framework called Letter to a Loved One suggests you tell your beloved why he or she would love this particular place, for instance, and begins with the line, ""You\'d like it here; _____. There are worse places that _____."" As you press on, you encounter prompts that require more input, and eventually, a tale forms. You aren\'t confined to elaborating on pre-written blurbs; you may delete those words and take your own journey, and each world offers a freeform option that allows you to write wherever you like. But the frameworks represent the muse\'s creative injections, and there are enough of them to suit writers of all skill levels, if not necessarily all interests.', ' ', ""The boundaries on subject matter are inherent to the game. These are science-fiction worlds, and while you could ostensibly use them to tell all kinds of stories, Elegy for a Dead World's imagery naturally limits you. In most ways, the limitations are a function of its design: writers, like other artists, often flourish when confined; limits are defined by genre, medium, occasion, and commission, and allow the artist to get deep and specific rather than broad and general. But Elegy's vital limitations lurk within its predetermined frameworks, and needn't have manifested in its relatively small, similarly themed worlds. You can write what you wish, but should you want your story to consistently reflect the landscape, you must accept what the muse provides. He's fickle that way."", 'Don\'t presume, however, that Elegy for a Dead World doesn\'t provide ample creative freedom. I have used a library as a backdrop for a miniature autobiography, which proved an effective exercise in brevity, a quality for which I\'m not known. In another world, I used prearranged stanzas to craft a raunchy poem I can\'t print here. You can name and publish these stories, which appear with still images that match the environments that inspired them, as well as browse other players\' creations. You would suppose most popular stories would reflect the somberness of the game\'s visuals, but players\' stories often begin with such hysterical lines as ""There are TBone steaks in the sky"" and ""When I have fears that cannot be soothed, I reach for an ice cold Coors Light."" It seems some imaginative souls refuse to be restricted after all.', ""Appropriately enough, Elegy for a Dead World's potential impact lies as much within you as it does within the game. I imagine many people might download, play, and scoff, wholly alienated by a creation tool that expects so much and provides so little. And there are times when I open the game only to stare at it for a few moments, become blinded by my own lack of artistic vision, and then shut it down in favor of entertainment that expects less of me. Yet there's nothing like Elegy for a Dead World, a muse in the guise of a narrative creation tool in the guise of a video game, and its within those layers that you find the treasures.""]"Justin Clark,17-Dec-14,Destiny Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/destiny-the-dark-below-review/1900-6415992/,6,Xbox One & PS4,"[""Three months after the release, the chances are very good that you know how you feel about Destiny and how you will likely feel about The Dark Below. If the problems that have left many a player crestfallen, even angry, in the weeks and months since the game hit haven't affected your need to keep at the constant grindstone week after week, then The Dark Below at least gives your daily runthrough a nice kick in the pants for a few days."", ""The scenario is that new non-player character Eris Morn is one of six warriors sent to go kill big baddie Crota (whose sword you wield during one of the early missions on The Moon in the campaign). She is the only one who survived, and she is now enlisting the help of Guardians to help finish what she started. Eris as a persistent storyteller is a good one, a better one than your previous companion (known affectionately as Dinklebot) at least, and her desperation and post-traumatic stress disorder lurk behind every word. Of course, that story is in one ear and out the other, as it is with most of Destiny's campaign content. You get an initial mission in the Cosmodrome as an appetizer, and it's there to introduce the new screaming female wizard baddie, Omnigul, and a new debuff called Weight of Darkness that comes into play when you start the raid called Crota's End."", ""From there follows a random spewing of new content, all to get your character good and ready to take on Crota's End, the main event. Ultimately, instead of building on Destiny to offer something we haven't seen or fixing some of the game's biggest issues, all The Dark Below does is amplify everything both good and terrible about Destiny. The core mechanics haven't changed and don't need to, since the gunplay is the one thing that Bungie nailed right out of the gate. The campaign missions to stop the Hive from resurrecting Crota are challenging, occasionally unique (one of the early sections involves a hectic firefight in planetary AI Rasputin's core while classical music plays as a warning siren), but ultimately meaningless. Most of them are all too similar to the missions youve played hundreds of times before, and the rewards are paltry, with the exception of the new fusion rifle Murmur, which at least has some elemental tricks up its sleeve. The same goes for the PlayStation-exclusive Strike, which is disappointingly, painfully short. Better rewards can be had in the new Daily and Weekly Heroics, though these two missions are tied directly to the add-on, so should you not splurge on The Dark Below, there will be weeklies you will not have access to. As it is, the two current missions, even if you manage to roll deep with a fireteam, are aggravatingly difficult."", ""Because of these limitations, to stand even a ghost of a chance with most of the new content, you must grind and grind often. The Dark Below ostensibly requires you to be level 28, but there's very little in the pack that approaches doable or fun until you're at 29 or better. The new multiplayer maps--Cauldron, Pantheon, and Skyshock--are fun enough, though fairly nondescript as far as multiplayer maps go, not giving nearly as much of the verticality that the original maps deliver so well. Skyshock in particular can be a vast, empty nightmare on small-team playlists or a frustrating, sniper-filled hellhole when there's more."", ""All this is Destiny's biggest post-game problem in a nutshell: After level 20, the game, at its worst, actively impedes you from having fun, and at best, it artificially extends the amount of time you need to spend with it. Even with the tweaks that have been made--the ability to purchase upgrade materials from vendors instead of farming, improved weapon drops, the new level cap--everything you do is in aid of reaching arbitrary goals. The list of grueling tasks continues to grow, and you can add the brand new insanity that is upgrading Exotic equipment to the list. (If you had Exotics before purchasing The Dark Below, then your progress is now dependent on Xur even having your item in stock that week to upgrade it, unless you are lucky enough to find the new version of the Exotic as a drop.) The add-on exacerbates the frustration by making the new content reliant on your Guardian being at the highest level possible, which, as it always has, relies on repeating content you've already seen countless times already. Arguably, the game tries to compensate by making new gear accessible to whoever can afford it from vendors, but that has the added effect of rendering the last two months of many players' work useless, especially the folks who struggled through Vault of Glass."", 'Ironically, the most fun part of the DLC is a quest to fill a special urn, purchased from weekend vendor Xur. It\'s a five-step quest in the vein of the Exotic Bounties, with a nice, varied set of objectives and no level requirements. The quest also contains what\'s possibly the most enjoyable objective in the entire game thus far, where, instead of participating in a normal Public Event in Earth\'s Skywatch, you get a message stating, ""The enemy is moving against each other,"" which triggers a large-scale Fallen/Hive war, involving every enemy type from both factions. In the middle of the chaos, you must kill a tough-as-nails boss knight called Urzok the Hated. The quest is pure madness, and any players passing through can participate; its the kind of event that Destiny should provide far more often. Upon killing Urzok, a quest on The Moon opens up and asks you to kill waves and waves of higher-level enemies using one of Crota\'s swords, all while the floor is pitted with fiery panels of death. It\'s hard, but at no point does the mission feel unfair, nor does it seem as though your enemies are there just to soak up bullets. It\'s Destiny at its most clever, and though the reward doesn\'t necessarily justify the effort, the game would shine so much brighter were it to provide more of this brand of fun rather than expecting you to spend 20 minutes in the Crucible to earn three more pathetic marks so that you may one day afford your 75-mark weapon.', 'As mentioned, all of this is the lead-up to the big show, which is Crota\'s End. Much like Vault of Glass, it involves a lot of organization: Bungie still offers no raid matchmaking and expects you to have friends that own Destiny and are willing to coordinate play times. Crotas End also brings with it plenty of rough fights, along with an over-reliance on ""somebody needs to stand here and wait"" puzzles. The raid doesnt do much creatively with the landscape, perspective, enemy placement, or enemy types, but there\'s at least some combat variety and plenty of visually stunning backdrops to ogle when you get a moment to pay attention. The first moments are almost awe-inspiring, beginning with a leap of faith into an endless abyss, along with a horde of Thrall and a steadily dying light that eventually restricts your ability to move altogether. It\'s then 20 minutes of fumbling around in the dark with your team, trying to activate new sources of light, and many a mad dash away from lamps that explode once lit.', ""What follows is a series of last stands in which you must wait upon panels to magically build bridges between one platform and the next, and are then beset upon by high-level bullet sponges. Vault of Glass started similarly, though the stakes are higher here: endless waves of thrall and durable knights swarm you, all while you try to coordinate who remains on platforms, who picks off the Thrall, and who functions as a veritable team medic. It isn't uncommon to simply stall for time just long enough for a single gunner to make the run across a platform--and there's very little in gaming as satisfying as the sigh of relief when most of the team is dead, and someone still manages to cross the final bridge. Collectively, these encounters feel like an attempt to do something beyond the norm, but the challenge makes it a demanding adventure that won't necessarily end in victory. As expected, Crotas End is highly difficult, and as with Vault of Glass, while there's a recommended level of 28, you're not making a dent in the thing until you hit 30-32, which, of course, involves repeating content, over and over, until you get there. To be fair, however, reaching level 30 is certainly easier now than it once was."", ""If you're interested in The Dark Below, you know what kind of game Destiny is. You're okay with the grinding. You have a like-minded clan that you play with frequently. You've been level 30 since October. You spend two or three hours a day racking up resources just in case. You are the Destiny player the game wants, which essentially means that you are a farmer. You find out what kind of product you want, and you invest the herculean time and energy needed to obtain it and then nurture it with constant love to bring it to fruition until you decide to destroy it and plant something new in its place. This is Destinys circle of life, and The Dark Below does just enough to feed it, if not enough to make it thrive.""]"Jeremy Signor,16-Dec-14,The Talos Principle Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-talos-principle-review/1900-6415993/,9,PC,"[""There comes a point in single-player games where we can feel utterly alone with ourselves. It's not just that no one else is around in the game, but everything is obscured from our perception. The finite levels begin to close in as you feel their limitations stop you from doing what you really want to do. We even feel trapped within the very mysteries we're meant to solve as we question what the point of it all is. This only really affects us because it mirrors how life treats us a lot of times. Why are we doing what we're doing? Is there a point to living, some grand design that makes our work worth it? This exact sense of isolation is explored in The Talos Principle, a contemplative meditation on the nature of humanity wrapped in an excellent first-person puzzle game."", ""Not that you're human to begin with. You awaken in a Grecian garden with no memory of what came before, armed with only the sophisticated communication skills that an adult might possess. You then hear what claims to be the voice of God, who commands you to gather the multitude of tetrominoes scattered throughout. You have free rein to enter and unlock every area within your sight, but the voice forbids you from ascending the tower at the center. Collect all the pieces, and you earn life eternal. And yet you're not entirely blind to the circumstances around you. Your form is robotic in nature, so you immediately deduce that you're not a biological human being. Sometimes the details of the world around you turn blurry and fuzzy, as if the world itself is glitching, so it's not hard to figure out you're inside some kind of computer simulation."", ""The tetrominoes themselves are cleverly placed behind gauntlets of puzzles you have to solve using several implements and switches that have been provided for you. Levels typically involve finding your way from one point to the next while bypassing the obstacles along the way. The most basic of these is the barrier of light, which you can dissipate by pressing a switch, aligning a colored beam of light into a matching hole, or disrupting it by using a special jammer you sometimes find nearby. Other obstacles, like mines, machine guns, or even the level itself, require similar strategies, but also involve timing and light reflexes. One element remains consistent: most puzzles task you with bypassing whatever is in your way through logic, often to the point where the game becomes a door-holding simulator. It's not uncommon to hold a barrier open from both sides so that you can get the tools you need to progress further."", 'Nevertheless, the combination of tools and level design keep the puzzles consistently fresh. Jammers and light-refracting rods let you manipulate any number of devices. Boxes can depress switches and serve as platforms to reach higher places. Fans blow whatever you put on them into whatever direction they point. You even use a recorder to record your own actions for a short time, and then play back the recording so that you may work alongside your clone in tandem, which is particularly useful once you gain the ability to have your recording carry objects above its head (including the real you). The Talos Principle forces you to broaden your mind and master the multitude of interlocking devices each room holds. Some puzzles even require you to move, align, and adjust them into a sprawling, interlocking system of mechanical relationships, an act that makes you feel particularly clever. Developer Croteam makes the most of a familiar conceit, challenging you to look at angles, sequencing, and timing in new, complex ways.', 'Some of the details of the world around you sometimes turn blurry and fuzzy, as if the world itself is glitching.', ""When you're not busy whittling away at the main task at hand, you're free to explore the strange simulation, which you soon find is something of a mix between the Garden of Eden and the Library of Alexandria. Aside from the forbidden tower, you're free to wander within the bounds of each area. You won't find much of interest aside from scenery, but you run into strange terminals scattered throughout the place. Each screen you find houses several pieces of information, some of which seem laughably irrelevant. Sometimes you find clues as to the nature of the place you find yourself, but sometimes you come across a history of the myth of Osiris, a passage from German philosopher Immanuel Kant, or a set of lyrics to an insipid modern-day pop song. But they are all musings trying to define what it means to be human."", ""And then there's the library assistant, which starts out as a plain speak program meant to assist you in a more conversational tone. Before you know it, however, it starts asking you questions about your nature, what a person is, what morals are, and many other heady topics in an increasingly passive-aggressive manner. You eventually get into full-on philosophy debates with it, and, much like real philosophy debates, you hardly ever feel victorious (though the jerk of an assistant will certainly try to claim as much), but you get to stretch your ideas until they either break or strengthen. Where most games are content to make you feel physically powerful, The Talos Principle dares to put you in the shoes of Socrates."", ""The puzzle rooms, while often brain-bending, are short enough that you might blaze through them with an almost mechanical glee, which almost seems to undermine the existential theme of the game. But we're talking about The Talos Principle here, so named for the bronze man of Greek myth that suggests that, if a machine can be like a human, then a human is like a machine. We are, after all, consciousness attached to working parts. You quickly learn the basics of how to manipulate the divine tools you're given, and your knowledge and expertise grow as your ability to apply logic as you move through the levels increases. But then, so can a machine. Artificial Intelligence can learn, too."", ""But as you get better at your given vocation, you're going to wander inevitably over to the terminals and pore over every work, absorbing what the ages' finest thinkers have to say about the human condition, what history and mythology tell us about our mortality and our immortality, and how the human race is advancing on the back of what came before. You listen to the audio logs of the simulation creator's musings on life and science and civilization. You read the QR codes of the AIs that came before and hear about what conclusions they came to. You even enter the tower you've been forbidden to climb because you just can't help yourself. The game doesn't require you to do any of this, but you do because you're inherently curious and eager to learn, another pesky human trait."", 'The puzzle rooms, while often brain-bending, are short enough that you might blaze through them with an almost mechanical glee.', ""After hunting down every last bit of information that the world has to offer, you don't come to any neat conclusions, but quite the opposite.

But you trudge on anyway, gathering tetrominoes as you use the knowledge of the past to build a future for yourself. The hints that the QR codes give build on your past experiences to help you solve the harder puzzles. The vast repository of knowledge at your fingertips help you form ideas about humanity and morality, which you arm yourself with when talking to that smug assistant. Every idea, every thought you come across, helps shape your belief system, ultimately informing whether you accept eternal life, ascend the tower, or stay behind and help the next generation reach new metaphorical heights. Your success is truly built from the whole of everyone's past triumphs and failures."", ""The Talos Principle is an absolute joy to play, packed to the gills with expertly designed puzzles and enough ancillary content to make any history of philosophy buff salivate. But all of that is almost beside the point in the face of the game's thematic ambitions. It may seem like you're alone in this world, but you're really not, and that's the greatest triumph of The Talos Principle: It serves as a fantastic representation of the human condition, complete with curiosity, speculation, wonder, fear, and a yearning to know the unknowable. But most importantly, it nails the role that isolation plays in the human condition. Because of all we don't know, because of how seemingly out of control we all are in the cosmic sense, we feel alone.

What might not translate in its ambiguous title is a wholly unique hook: twin dimensions in which its hack-and-slash fare unfolds through a revolving door of swappable puppet heroes.

Before long, you slay and consume the souls of assorted creatures: the zombie behemoth, the lupine berserker, and the crocodilian shaman. Uncovering new skills and talents are a large part of the genre's draw, so watching this stable of playable heroes from diverse species and creeds grow into a fighting force is a special treat. These fully customizable supporting characters can be rotated in to fill out the remainder of your four-slot party and are every bit as upgradeable as the top-billed duo, down to their own unique armor, weapons, and skill trees."", 'Your chosen hero and the demon bicker, jab, and actively mock one another as the dynamic between them shifts from subservience to reluctant partnership.', ""Weapon of choice is one of Heretic Kingdoms' strongest virtues: a refreshing change of pace from the traditional lone wolf mentality when it comes to hacking through its fantasy environments. And the Heretic Kingdoms, though represented through the expected archetypes--the forest zone, the desert area, the caverns and crypts--are beautiful, tangible places, bearing the weight of history and scars that are reflected in fine detail. A few levels stand out as especially unique, strange, and otherworldly. But for the most part, they each house their sights and vistas to be gazed down upon from an isometric perch."", 'With the addition of the shadow realm, each area is also represented in a darker, slightly altered mirror of itself, shrouded in neon nether energy.

Nearly every recipe for an item in my level range required ingredients I hadn't encountered yet, despite the burgeoning stash of materials quickly filling an extensive inventory. I regularly scanned the unorganized list of recipes for potential improvements, but the only craftable items were inferior to my current gear by several levels.

Furthermore, its Wild West-themed combat reveals more tactical depth the more you play."", ""Choosing a character in a well-made fighting game is like deciding what to eat at a restaurant you frequent. There's safety in going with what you're used to, but pleasant surprises await if you dare to try something new. Both feelings initially resonate in Secret Ponchos, though sticking to one fighter becomes an easy choice the moment you discover that each outlaw has a progression system. Superb skill yields substantial rewards, and Secret Ponchos sticks with traditional upgrades toward increased health, stamina, range, and other familiar stats."", ' ', 'The diversity of this small cast of five outlaws follows the adage that ""what one stat giveth, the other taketh away."" The Kid Red (a blunt nod to Billy the Kid) is a dual-wielder whose high-firing rate is tempered with low health. The opposite applies to the presumptive Civil War veteran known as The Deserter. Each hoodlum performs according to seven stats, and it\'s refreshing to play something where each attribute feels immediately tangible in combat.', ""My go-to outlaw is The Matador, the obligatory left-field character in a group of Western-themed outlaws. She's not unlike the French fencer Charlotte, who equally stuck out in the predominantly Japanese-themed Samurai Shodown. This bullfighter is limited in ranged attacks, but her melee hits are especially lethal. It wasn't conscious, but this choice does reflect my tendency to rely on melee kills in first-person shooters. I simply like the immediacy and gratification of an up-close, high-damage attack. And just like with a good fighting game, there's a lot to glean from learning moves beyond the standard attack. In The Matador's case, a lunging stab is both deadly and far-reaching, though it leaves you wide open if you miss. Using her cape to throw up blinding dust is a perfect overture before unleashing a series of uninterrupted sword attacks."", ""If you suspect that this roster is intentionally modest, that's because it is. If you look at the Outlaw submenu, you'll notice question marks in place of two concealed desperados, saved as paid downloadable content for a future date. When the initial cast includes someone as unusual as a matador, it wouldn't be unreasonable to get a Davy Crockett-inspired frontiersman or a Rough Rider like Teddy Roosevelt down the line. My money is on a Robert Rodriguez-influenced mariachi performer with an arsenal in his guitar case, but what I really want is a broken bottle-wielding barkeep who is sick and tired of his saloon getting trashed."", ""I simply want more fighters because I want to see how Switchblade Monkey's artists interpret more Western archetypes, given how marvelous the current cast looks. Pointy and angular lines work for this fivesome and are eye-catching as both 2D art (e.g.. during the match introduction) and as 3D models during the match and main menu. If you told me that this game had been spun off from a cult graphic novel, I would have believed you, though the lack of an expository single-player mode is mildly disappointing."", ""For all the hours that one can spend upgrading the ghostly Phantom Poncho or the quick-drawing Killer, the limited selection of four maps and deathmatch modes does the game no favors in holding your attention. That said, the eight-player Free For All isn't your standard deathmatch, since the victor is determined on the best kill/death ratio, not overall kills. When you're using a fighter who cannot heal (e.g., everyone but The Deserter), hiding becomes a viable option, especially if there's a kill count lead you want to protect. Before you know it, you've become that one character in The Hunger Games (or, if you wish, Battle Royale) who manages to survive much of the story by staying out of trouble. Hiding is also tactically beneficial in one-on-one matches if you have a health lead. If the match counter reaches zero, the healthier opponent is declared the winner. If you're the more injured opponent, running around anxiously to hunt down the potential victor can leave you careless and outside your comfort zone."", ""The indifference of death and the unfairness of the Wild West bears out fittingly in Free For All. Managing your kill/death ratio is all the more challenging when you have seven hunters out for your head. At its cruelest, this mode lets you steal kills. When one outlaw manages to reduce another opponent's health to a sliver, you can swoop in to finish off that weakened foe, at the risk of drawing the ire of the player who did all the work. As a minor consolation for these stolen kills, Secret Ponchos does factor the total damage you've dealt in a given match."", ' ', 'Secret Ponchos\' elegance is in its cover system. Taking temporary refuge behind a horse trough or a train car to take a breath and collect yourself is a sensible tactic for any gunslinger. Hiding behind objects to avoid gunfire is not unusual in top-down shooters. How Secret Ponchos stands out is two-fold. Depending on your outlaw of choice, getting into a proper cover pose will speed up your healing, reloading, or stamina recovery process. This heightens the tension not only for you but also for your pursuers, who know full well that the tide of battle can be rebalanced if you manage to avoid gunfire long enough. Actual concealment is the other benefit of cover. Functioning like a short-term version of fog-of-war tactics seen in real-time strategy games, pressing against an object renders you invisible unless you\'re within another character\'s field of vision. It\'s easy to appreciate this level of depth. Cover can turn a shootout into a cat-and-mouse hunt, especially if a team with a point lead chooses to hide while the clock runs down. On the flip side, bold hombres who do not believe in stealth can just stand in the middle of a given map\'s open area with the benefit of a 360-degree view and wait for would-be challengers. If you want to be Peter Fonda and yell, ""Come on out!"" at the top of your lungs, Secret Ponchos gives you such moments.', ""The first time I was gunned down by an opponent who had taken full advantage of the cover system was the moment I appreciated the thoughtfulness that has been poured into Secret Ponchos. You can always count on adversarial multiplayer enthusiasts to pick out the best-performing characters within days of a game's release. So when an eight-player ranked match features at least one of each of the five outlaws, you know to expect a beautifully balanced competition. Since it encourages replay through one fighter over a long period, it's not the small roster that limits Secret Ponchos' appeal but rather its passable selection of maps and modes. Yet Secret Ponchos is well worth falling for, if only because playing as The Killer and using cover for a speedy reload is the closest a game has ever come to depicting the first Metal Gear Solid boss fight from Revolver Ocelot's perspective.""]"Kevin VanOrd,11-Dec-14,LIMBO Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/limbo-review/1900-6415989/,8,Xbox One,"['""Nana, do little boys and girls go to heaven when they die?""', '""No, honey. They go to limbo.""', 'This conversation with my grandmother introduced me to the idea of an otherworldly realm in which I pictured children wandering aimlessly through darkness and mist, denied the pleasure of communing with God. I imagined that to be in Limbo was to feel perpetually lost and unable to find the way, or to even know what your destination might be.', 'Limbo, the game, is special in that while it does not wholly depict that mysterious dimension as my mind did, it captures its essence. You are a boy who wakes up in a lonely world made up only of black, white, and shades of gray. Video game logic demands you walk from left to right, jumping over obstacles as they appear, a simple task that needs little attention in the initial moments. This is your chance to absorb your surroundings. The background provides an illusion of depth, but its branches and bridges are out of focus, as if you are dreaming them into existence. The pint-sized hero, his bright blinking eyes shining from his blackened silhouette, trots ahead with the charming gangliness of a six-year-old.', ""Then comes death. Limbo is a hostile place, home to giant spiders that would feast upon you, and traps apparently scattered by the world's other denizens. You step onto a claw trap, and it closes on your neck. Your head falls to the ground and wobbles just for a moment before lying still. No tears are shed, no music plays--the game provides no grand gesture to honor your demise. It simply happens, and you revive at the most recent checkpoint to try the puzzle again. Some of these deaths aren't outright fair; stepping on a pressure plate could mean certain death, but so could jumping over it. Such inconsistencies aren't common, but your first time in Limbo requires some trial-and-error experimentation. Loading times are short, and checkpoints are frequent, however, so death is rarely a frustration, though often a horror."", ""What does it all mean? People pondered that question when Limbo was first released on the Xbox 360 in 2010, and the Xbox One version adds nothing new that would illuminate the mystery of this world, so there's little reason to splurge on another version if you've already played. Nevertheless, the ending offers important clues to the greater plot, if not to the details of the game's events and objects--the imposing neon hotel sign that you must cross, for instance, or the murderous children, seemingly escaped from Lord of the Flies, that aim their blowguns at you. Limbo means for its atmosphere to consume you in the moment, and in that sense, it succeeds. You drag a dead child's corpse to solve a puzzle, and perhaps wonder if anyone grieves this lost soul given the apathy of the realm. You glimpse a figure and regard her with tenderness, but the brief glimmer of hope is snuffed out in an instant."", ""It isn't until the final third of its two- to three-hour runtime that Limbo's puzzles become challenging. The first half of the game is more concerned with building dread and ambiguity. Even after being vanquished, a colossal spider's remaining leg thrusts at you from its thorax, one final act of defiance that could leave two corpses for the crows to pick. When you pull the leg from the spider, the audible cracks and visible white splatters emphasize just how recently its life force was crushed. Elsewhere, you push boxes and pull levers, rushing to finish the puzzle before the rising water fills the room. Failure means watching the dear boy go as limp as a ragdoll as liquid fills his lungs."", ""The second half leaves behind the horrors in favor of puzzles involving gravity and complex machinery. As memorable as it is to navigate tilting rooms with only a few hanging lamps to light the way, it is that spider that most embodies Limbo's somber spirit. The later puzzles are complex and clever, but they don't haunt the heart. The finale feels abrupt because it returns to the first hour's imagery, having abandoned it for long enough to have altered your personal connection with the game from an emotional one to an intellectual one. And yet the end offers insight into a backstory left otherwise untouched--enough of it to inspire another playthrough, this time ever so much wiser than you were before."", ' ']"Jason Venter,11-Dec-14,JUJU Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/juju-review/1900-6415987/,6,PS3,"[""If you really like the Super Mario Bros. games but for one reason or another would never dream of investing in the hardware required to play them, you might want to take a look at Juju. It's a platformer that carries you through four vibrant worlds, forcing you to bop and bash a bunch of cute enemies while riding on the backs of dinosaurs, collecting trinkets, and finding hidden bonus areas, much like Mario might."", ""With the exception of the Rayman games, there aren't a lot of options for PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360 that capture the joy of two-dimensional platforming. Juju doesn't do that consistently, either, but it has its moments. Sometimes things even come together well enough that you'd swear you've been deposited in the Mushroom Kingdom. Perhaps the game's biggest problem is that it seems to be working to evoke that particular response rather than to establish a consistent and engaging identity of its own."", 'An introductory cutscene shows two young mammals are playing outside when a wise old bear walks past them on his way to what looks like an Incan pyramid. The youngsters follow him, darting behind trees to avoid detection. They watch as their elder sticks his staff in a pedestal slot and communes with the translucent images of four distant planets. He is interrupted by a little bird that seeks his help, so he descends to the nearby forest. That distraction gives the kids a chance to mess with the staff. Their meddling releases a giant bat and a bunch of bees and assorted pests. Before long, the kindly old bear is abducted, the world is overrun by malicious wildlife, and a little pink bear with a magic mask--one of the two responsible for the mess in the first place--must reassemble the staff by journeying to the four mysterious planets.', ""Juju takes place almost entirely in these four themed worlds. Each one consists of around eight action stages, along with two boss encounters. Individual stages don't feature a timer, just a goal at the end where you can stop a spinning wheel to collect a prize before returning to the world hub to select the next stage. Areas are littered with the game's equivalent of coins or rings, and you earn medals based on how many of them you gather and how many bonus stages you find and clear."", ""The pink bear cub you control is a relatively weak heroine as the game begins but strong enough to get the job done thanks to the assistance of her magic mask. Mini-boss encounters add additional skills to her repertoire so that, by the end of the game, she is butt-bouncing, hover-jumping, and tossing explosive balls at an increasingly tough group of nasty critters. She often must pause and start banging on her drum, as well, which opens up the path ahead or distracts enemies long enough that they can be defeated. This is one of the game's few attempts to do something genuinely different, but it mostly falls flat because it's just a hassle. You press and hold a button for a few seconds when prompted by a situation, and that's the extent of it. More than anything, it breaks up the pace that the game might have established at that point."", 'Early on, Juju is rather dull. Exploring the sparsely populated introductory world feels more like a chore than an adventure, and the background artwork--though detailed nicely in the Unreal engine--is too generic to be interesting. Checkpoints are frequent, and the threat from enemies is minimal, so players of all ages should have little difficulty progressing to the end of each stage. However, subsequent worlds are a great deal livelier. By the time they reach the third and fourth planets, the player will need to pay attention to progress and will be rewarded for doing so with some of the most vibrant artwork that the game offers.', ""The aforementioned bonus stages provide an additional incentive to explore every nook and cranny, but they're not cleverly hidden. Typically, the player need only rush toward an obviously placed large wall, and part of it will pull away to reveal a magical gate. Bonus areas come in only a few configurations throughout the game, and thus get tedious quickly. Some of them are surprisingly easy to fail until you've practiced a lot, and you only get a single shot at them unless you drop into a pit or something on purpose and try again from the last checkpoint. Because the bonus stages are so repetitive and even a little frustrating, they feel like a waste of time and not the reward they might have been."", ""Bosses serve as another stumbling point. You encounter most of them twice. First, they appear as mini-bosses with one pattern. For instance, you encounter a toad, and you have to get him to swallow stinging bees so that he harms himself and flees the scene. Then you face the same foe, which now has learned a few new tricks, at the end of a given planet. Most of the bosses are difficult to defeat, serving as an abrupt spike in difficulty that could leave younger players out in the cold. The final boss in particular provides a hefty challenge. It's by no means insurmountable, and older players should be able to persevere after two or three attempts and some attack pattern memorization, but these oversized antagonists are a bit much for the younger set."", ""That's a shame, because kids are the obvious audience for Juju.The young heroine doesn't provide much for adults to identify with, and the overly cute adversaries feel like they belong in children's television programming. It's easy to appreciate the vibrant visuals regardless of age (though not the lengthy load times preceding each stage), but that's probably not enough to keep your attention over the course of a four- to five-hour campaign. There is a good way of bridging the generational gap, however: Juju lets a second player drop in and out at any time. Two people can work together to snag all of the loot, which makes bonus stages easier, and to find all of the secrets. They do have to stay fairly close together, since the camera isn't willing to pull back very far (players temporarily drop out of sight if they stray too far apart), but it works. There's no worry about running out of lives, either, meaning the cooperative experience is a positive net experience in spite of a few hitches."", ""With Juju, the developers at Flying Wild Hog have cobbled together a charming adventure that never surpasses its inspiration but still manages to provide a generally inoffensive romp through gorgeous fantasy worlds. Unfortunate difficulty spikes may keep some youngsters at bay, and the repetition is discouraging regardless of your age, but there's still some innate appeal to this cute and competent platformer, which gets the job done with minimal fuss.""]"Peter Brown,10-Dec-14,The Crew Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-crew-review/1900-6415988/,5,PS4,"[""The Crew tries to be a driving game with something for everyone. You can team up with a group of friends for an epic road trip filled with fast-paced illegal activities, and seamlessly explore a massive map of the U.S., from the tip of Maine, all the way down to Miami, over to Los Angeles and back again, passing through other iconic cities along the way. Though it's true that all of this is possible, the experience isn't all that it's made out to be. The Crew tries to do a lot, and while it technically delivers the features it promises, it frequently stumbles over itself. There are brief moments of joy within, but just when you start to think the game's turned a corner, a bump in the road sends your joyride careening off course. When the best thing a racing game has going for it is the variety of environments it has to offer, you know something's amiss."", ""You start off in the streets of Detroit, but it's not long before you're rolling through mountains, everglades, and forests. The huge maps and its colossal number of activities is intimidating at first, but that's great: the more places to go and things to do, the merrier. Story missions, which take you through a trope-filled campaign that plays out like a Fast & Furious sequel, send you from one region of the country to the next, and missions emerge out of the blue along the way. You street race, smuggle contraband, take down competing criminals, and tackle bite-sized emergent challenges that test your abilities behind the wheel while you're on the go. There are hundreds of things to do, but only some are truly fun. The problem? With so much ground to cover, The Crew feels and looks like it's stretched too thin, and it's evident from the start. The Crew's world may be massive and varied, but it's not good-looking. It's constantly plagued by texture and geometry pop-in, and looks generally outdated. People, buildings, the environment, and most importantly, the cars, are represented by disappointing models that suffer from an unsightly amount of aliasing."", ' ', ""At some point during your journey across America, you wonder: what was that about forming a crew, again? Despite the game's title and pitch, The Crew is a single-player experience tucked into a multiplayer server. It starts with a story that casts you on a grand mission, and you're constantly encouraged by your cohorts to head to the next step along the way. You always have the option of inviting three of your friends along for the ride, but at no point does the game inspire you to do so. Think extra crewmates will help you on a difficult mission? Nope; the game scales its difficulty accordingly. If anything, forming a crew is a chore that's easy to brush aside. The best thing you can do to improve your chances at success is to upgrade your car, but the way in which The Crew facilitates this can get a little frustrating. While the game won't prevent you from entering a story mission, it will tell you if you're below the recommended level. You can purchase kits when you're avatar's level is high enough, but it takes a while to hit successive milestones."", ""In practice, you earn new parts as rewards for missions, but playing story missions alone won't provide you with enough parts to get your vehicle to the appropriate level towards the end of the game. That's when you have to grind through optional missions, which pop up as you drive around the map. Some of these objectives are enjoyable, such as long-distance jumps and missions that challenge you to drive as fast and as far as you can while keeping your tires on the road. Others, like the missions that challenge you to hit a series of targets that are strewn both on and off the road, are frustrating. Essentially, the game asks you to drive like a jerk, and it's not fun when you can't help but careen into other cars and buildings as you try your best to fulfill the criteria to earn a medal. It comes down to the luck of the draw. Sometimes the coast is clear, and other times you're bombarded by a phalanx of other vehicles that you can't avoid when pursuing objectives."", ""These optional missions can be useful when you need to level up, but they can also be an annoyance when you're just trying to get from point A to point B. Every time you hit the road, you eventually cross the virtual gate that activates these missions, but there's nothing you can do to prevent them from activating automatically. Pass through a gate, and you have to suffer through a cluttered user interface, which starts with icons, but ends with a large results screen that blocks your view while driving. Apart from driving off the road to avoid a gate, or entering into a menu to abort after a mission activates, you're at the mercy of the map."", ""One of the best aspects of a racing game is the selection of cars that you get to choose from, but The Crew has a meager selection and does a poor job of incentivizing you to explore your options. Story missions are broken up by the type of vehicle they require: street, dirt, raid, performance, or circuit. Not every vehicle can be kitted out to fit every spec, but the one you get at the start of the game definitely can. Given that you earn new parts for the vehicle you complete missions with, you are never compelled to pick up new cars. Maybe your curiosity will get the better of you and you'll check out a new car, but there's nothing stopping you from using the same car from the beginning of the game through to the end."", 'Although the variety of cars is underwhelming and underutilized, the story missions take advantage of the different car specs in a good way. As you travel from one region of the country to the next, you encounter different terrain and environments that call upon the different types of kits you can fit to your car. You race street cars through dense cities, take on dirt car races through construction sites and rough terrain, and tear across states in souped up performance vehicles. The story missions are largely the best moments in the game, however, there exceptions: raid car missions and fleeing missions.', ""Raid missions are fun at first--you charge through mountains, swamps, and back country in an armored vehicle--but at some point, the game decides that you need to fulfill precise criteria, such as collecting objects on rough terrain under a strict time limit, and raid cars are anything but precise. They slip and slide all over the place, and when these missions leave no room for error, you end up very frustrated when you're cut short due to the game's poor physics. The same can be said for missions where you have to flee from cops, who are incredibly overpowered. These missions are not fun in the least, and the cops' unusual bursts of speed feels like a product of driving games of old. This isn't the only example of frustrating AI. During races against the computer, cars sometimes drive off of tracks for no reason, taking a 90 degree turn out of the blue before flying off of a cliff."", ""Essentially, the game asks you to drive like a jerk, and it's not fun when you can't help but careen into other cars and buildings as you try your best to fulfill the criteria to earn a medal."", ""With rough physics and AI, you get into a lot of collisions, but luckily, damage doesn't hinder your car's driving capabilities. However, you do have to endure a slow-motion cutscene as punishment when you take a strong hit. Eventually, you have to pay a negligible fee to fix your car if you've gotten in a lot of accidents, but it's a drop in the bucket compared to how much money you earn during missions. If crashing is not a big deal, wasting players' time with slow-motion cutscenes as punishment is pointless and disrespectful of their time."", ""Unfortunately, you have to endure the game's questionable physics in other scenarios, most notably during player-versus-player races. It's nearly a guarantee that each PVP race will start with a ridiculous display of bugginess when opponents' cars suddenly speed up and flip in multiple directions at the drop of a hat. I've seen cars teleport into the sky, and rotate uncontrollably before appearing 20 feet down the track for no reason. These moments of chaos are funny, but they make for an inconsistent and unpredictable experience. Pray it doesn't happen to you. That's assuming you can even get into a PVP match. There are a handful of lobbies across the map, but they're severely underpopulated. It's a rare occurrence that you can find enough people to race against in less than 15 minutes. Luckily, you have the option to drive around while you wait, but it's still deflating when you can't find anyone to play with."", ' ', ""Keep in mind that if UPlay, PSN, or Xbox Live is down, you can't play The Crew, even if you just want to go solo. During my time with the game, I was booted due to server or connection issues on a daily basis, which was very frustrating. The most enjoyment you get out of the game's connected world comes from player-vs-player competitions, but even they have issues."", ""When The Crew puts you into races with good AI, and you get to race through interesting and varied environments, you get the feeling that you're playing a good game. When you struggle to find people to join your crew online, balk at the outdated graphics, and shake your head at the AI and the occasionally unpredictable physics, you realize: The Crew isn't that good after all. When you can't play due to server issues, you find a new game to play and leave The Crew in your dust.""]"Justin Clark,9-Dec-14,Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/phoenix-wright-ace-attorney-trilogy-review/1900-6415986/,7,3DS,"[""There was a time Phoenix Wright was the game to own for Nintendo's little dual-screen wonder. It was the kind of game no one was making on a system that was meant to do what no one else was doing. That made it special. Fast forward to 2014, four sequels and two spin-offs later, and now we have the first three games--Ace Attorney, Justice For All, and Trials & Tribulations--cleaned up, brushed off, given a simple 3D spitshine, and trotted out to the Nintendo eShop. The gameplay has remained untouched, for better and worse: You're still playing the well-coiffed crusader of justice called in to collect clues from crime scenes, scream objections when you've caught ne'er-do-wells in a lie, and ask all the right questions to make the most weird and wild collection of bad guys and gals since Adam West's Batman all lose their cool on the witness stand. The good news is that, at least conceptually, the original Phoenix Wright trilogy has held up very well over time. The problem is that it's not exactly special anymore."", ""It's actually a great problem to have. Point-and-click adventures and visual novels like Phoenix Wright are in vogue, and games are pushing the envelope several times a year. Even with that being the case, courtroom drama isn't exactly a crowded subgenre, and, as such, the Phoenix Wright games are still a unique snowflake in that regard. Where the Phoenix Wright games still stand out among the lot of them is in sheer charm. The streamlined anime art style, and the games' jovial sense of humor permeate everything. Phoenix Wright's world is a world of over-exaggerated reactions to everything, of eye-rolling yet brilliant puns, of unsubtle but slick pop culture references (personal favorite: The clown-based Fresh Prince of Bel-Air reference in Justice For All), and of fully formed, distinct, and wildly imaginative casts of characters with story arcs stretching over multiple games. Even though we're still dealing with murders--an overwhelming number of murders, but we'll get to that--there's such a lightness and color to the game it's hard to resist spending time with them over and over again as opposed to, say, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter's dour menagerie."", ""The series forgoes any sort of CSI-style deep diving to present the player with problems of logic, and using observation to point out glaring inconsistencies in the stories of liars, cheats, and murderers instead of just rote item collection, where the game is on rails as long as you have the right item in your possession. It's not a perfect system, especially the more complex the case is. There are dozens of instances where the judge asks for a clue to prove the witness is a liar, and the clue that makes sense in real life is not the one the game actually marks as correct, but for the most part, there's a common sense to advancing in all three games. In that regard, it's still old school in the best way: the player's intellect, not their talent for scrounging, is the core of the gameplay here."", ""And yet, there was an opportunity with the Ace Attorney Trilogy. Every year that passes, every time the game gets ported to a new platform, the series' GBA roots become more and more obvious, and its limitations become glaring. Its simplified anime art-style, while functional, can be seen here as consistent, but often repetitive, with the series' recent efforts towards innovation all occurring in the games after Trials and Tribulations released. The cases are almost always murders, with only rare variations to investigate a clue, or get a witness' story straight, and, more often than not, the game shows you who did it before Phoenix is allowed to figure it out. Interrogation methods haven't improved in all three games, though Justice For All's Psyche Lock system, a way of picking at a witness' testimony to get to their deepest secrets, is nice, though an even more cartoony addition than needed. But more than anything, the three games have been ported to multiple systems now, and the only real enhancements have been to the graphics. The 3DS trilogy is, to its credit, the sharpest it has ever looked or sounded. The extra real estate from the top screen has been put to good use, and the 3D is subtle, but the layering effect of all the character art is a nice, effective touch."", ""Meanwhile, the 3DS has seen its own exclusive Phoenix Wright sequel that finally brings all the innovation the fancy new hardware can afford to the table. It would've been a painstaking process, no doubt, but the first Phoenix Wright's final mission brings such welcome changes to the table, using the DS's audio and touchscreen functions, that the other two games, which still haven't gotten a similar treatment, are dimmed by comparison. Instead, the only other real enhancement to this new version is the ability to play the games in their original Japanese forms, which is neat if you understand Japanese, though Jeremy Blaustein's English localization is wonderful enough as it is."", ""There is, of course, the off-chance that the trilogy might be someone's first exposure to the life and times of Phoenix Wright, or at least their first exposure in a great many years, and it's as refined a jumping-off point for that as can be expected. For anyone for whom this is their third, four, or fifth time around, there's nothing new to discover, aside from the convenience of having all three games in one handy digital package. There's nothing inherently wrong with that, but knowing what the 3DS and this series is capable of, the games' flaws have never been more glaring, and not nearly enough has been done to overrule the objections players have had for years.""]"Kevin VanOrd,9-Dec-14,Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/lara-croft-and-the-temple-of-osiris-review/1900-6415985/,7,PS4 & Xbox One,"[""Isometric-view cooperative games aren't so uncommon in this day and age, not when Diablo III still commands a sizable audience and its imitators clamor for favor. What makes Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris stand out, at least from a mechanical perspective, is that it feels not like a button-mashing display of otherworldly power, but rather like a true adventure. Temple of Osiris is more about the wonder of mystical places and the pleasure of solving puzzles than about firing shotguns and squishing the rising undead. This is video gaming through the lens of Raiders of the Lost Ark, which in turn looked to the old serial adventures with such evocative names as Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe and Jungle Girl. The jungles and the universes change, but the unfettered drama of these classic stories still lives."", ""The tone and setting may recall adventures of years past, but the actual story and dialogue strike a mundane chord in spite of Temple of Osiris' mythological motifs. The evil Egyptian god Set is your primary nemesis, but he typically manifests as a less-than-imposing talking Instagram filter, sucking the color from your screen and informing you that your recent defeat of a big boss is merely a temporary setback. (It's a collision of cliches that will have your turning off your mind and focusing instead on the adventurous atmosphere.) Your goal is to restore the god Osiris to his former glory by finding scattered pieces of a statue, which means your narrative reward for conquering dungeons is a floating foot or disembodied torso. The epic reveal of such less-than-epic objects is a bit of an anticlimax, as is the game's unimpressive visual fidelity when you play on current-generation consoles. The new Lara Croft is not an argument for purchasing a new system, though temple ruins coated in green mist and roaring rivers teeming with traps nonetheless set the perfect stage for the trouble Lara and her three comrades are entangled within."", ' ', ""Travel with friends. You can play on your own, and the game wisely adjusts so that you can solve puzzles on your own, not just by tweaking environments, but by giving you access to a magical staff that allows you to raise platforms and slow down bomb countdowns. But you miss out on the game's finest pleasures should you go solo. When friends join you--locally, online, or both at once--you must find new ways of overcoming obstacles. Switches, levers, spiked walls, and catapults: these are the tricks of the game's trade, and the team is granted tools for manipulating them. One of you flings a grappling line to a hook across a chasm, and the others cross it like trapeze artists. One of you surrounds herself with a glowing bubble so that others can leap upon it and reach higher places."", 'Temple of Osiris strings these activities into a beautifully-paced adventure that breaks up puzzles with fun but fleeting combat encounters and chase sequences that get the blood flowing. These chases, incidentally, also give you an opportunity to coordinate grand feats, encouraging teammates to leap to optional platforms where currency and collectibles linger while other players rush forward, hoping only to stay alive as spiked explosives tumble towards them. Meanwhile, each new dungeon requires a new angle of approach--and offers a new chance to laugh at teammates that ignore the rules of engagement and run off, only to be impaled by spikes that rise from the rubble beneath their feet.', ""The puzzles aren't mind-benders, but conundrums like those that have you angling mirrors to deflect magic lasers require just enough teamwork and communication to make you feel a little clever for having pulled them off. That's presuming you don't run into any bugs, like flames you have lit that don't appear properly in your online partner's game--or presuming the sometimes skittery controls or invisible walls don't mess with your navigation. Boss encounters require a bit of creative thinking as well, requiring you and your partners to coordinate tossing bombs and raising platforms lest you succumb to the scarabs, skeletons, and bipedal alligators that swarm you all the while."", ""You need to fend those creatures off with pistols, grenade launchers, and other weapons, but firefights aren't very difficult, unless you strive to meet the optional challenges found in each level, or seek out combat tests in the hub area once you complete the four-hour story adventure. You collect currency and other doodads during your journey, and in doing so, find all sorts of weapons to equip, as well as rings and amulets that strengthen your combat abilities. It's not too tough to deal with the bad guys when they appear, however, making inventory management an occasional diversion rather than a deep and necessary feature."", ""If you're willing to let go of any hope for depth and instead seek a chunk of clever cooperative fun, however, Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris is ready to escort you on another tomb-raiding adventure. It's not the revelation that Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light was--it's a bit too glitchy and dated to herald it a new classic, in spite of the welcome addition of four-person online play. And yet as an afternoon's worth of jolly cooperation, Lara Croft's newest sojourn makes a fine flight of fancy to an Egypt that probably never was, but certainly should have been.""]"Miguel Concepcion,8-Dec-14,How to Survive Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/how-to-survive-storm-warning-edition-review/1900-6415984/,7,Xbox One & PS4,"['Naming a game after its tutorial might sound lazy, but it works for How to Survive. It would be like Activision naming its next shooter, Call of Duty: Combat Readiness. Not having Zombie or Dead in the title of a zombie-themed game is always a welcome change and thus, How to Survive stands out. Being stranded on an island with the undead is as dire a situation as any, but the titular manuals defuse the tension thanks to the guides author, Kovac, and his tongue-in-cheek delivery. This 2014 repackaging, How to Survive: Storm Warning Edition wasnt arbitrarily named either. The added rain can literally dampen your best-laid plans.', 'How to Survive is a fine complement to the more immediate and faster-paced zombie shooters like Dead Nation and Zombie Apocalypse. Those games match rapid-fire gun combat with large hordes of the undead. How to Survive appeals more to the player who seeks exploration and deeper item scavenging, the latter being inherent to the zombie genre. Thats not to say How to Survive has fewer zombies overall, or that its a slow burn. Encounters are plentiful, with being noticed by one zombie meaning that all other zombies nearby will make a beeline for you as well. Youre rewarded for thinking and acting on the fly. A careful stealth strategy can be thwarted by a single perceptive zombie who you missed hiding in the background. All the while, youre tasked with finding items and people, the information and means to get off this series of islands.', 'Wielding your first stick at the start of the game does not make for an effective first impression. The single-arm flailing of the stick gave me flashbacks of original-trilogy Star Wars action figures, the kind without elbow joints. While this made me skeptical about the rest of my playthrough, further upgrading and crafting made me more tolerant of some of the stiff animations. By contrast, the survivors execution moves are well animated and aptly lethal, leaving you with the satisfaction and certainty that a given zombie is unequivocally dead. Most adventure game finishing moves function as a reward for enduring a prolonged battle. In How to Survive, its a constant judgment call; executions yield more experience than regular kills, but these moves also leave you wide open after you finish your kill.', 'When creating campfires is essential and fire-enhanced weaponry makes every kill better, having a rain storm extinguish all your flames truly sucks. Stockpiling resources like flint becomes all the more crucial, forcing you to explore the islands that much more thoroughly, which in turn equals more zombie encounters. This is just one of the myriad hardships this re-release throws at you. Some of the new content (previously available as post-release DLC) also means much harder playthroughs and the incomparable suspense of surviving with a single life. The once add-on survivor named Nina is also back with a flamethrower, making her the ideal foil for all the rain scenes, provided you use the weapon wisely and in good health.', 'For the heightened difficulty options, the developers at EKO Software didnt just change stat values to reduce resources or add damage to enemy hits. They even included challenges through the user interface, where the action doesnt pause when you access your menus. This rewards preparation in between encounters and punishes those who cant multitask at a moments notice. You certainly need to think on your feet when you run into your first bear, crocodile, or their undead versions, all of which were not in the original game.', 'As much as How to Survive is at its most appealing when you explore, the added Barricade! DLC is a fitting accompaniment, wherein you have to protect survivors from waves of zombies rather than escape an island. Its not as engrossing as Horde Mode in Gears of War or Firefight in the Halo series, but thats not to say Barricade! is bereft of depth. While other games regularly provide you with resources to fortify your base, How to Survive forces you to leave the comforts of your encampment to scrounge for wooden planks and scant weaponry. Youre only as good as your ability to gather items to reinforce your barricade. Putting in this extra effort is unusual for a wave-based survival mode, and coupled with the exploratory design of How to Survive, Barricade! ended up becoming my favorite mode outside of the campaign.', 'How to Survive: Storm Warning Edition rewards the procrastinating zombie enthusiast whos been curious about the game and its add-on content. Its next to useless to the devoted who have followed How to Survive and have picked up every subsequent DLC along the way. Didnt EKO Software learn anything from the record industry--that the trick to luring fans with greatest hits collections is to add at least one new song, even if its terrible? This is not a directors cut, but rather EKO Softwares aspirational idea of a Game of the Year Edition.', ' ']"Justin Clark,5-Dec-14,The Wolf Among Us Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-wolf-among-us-review/1900-6415981/,8,PS4,"[""In 2014, in a pop culture environment where make it grim and gritty because were adults! is the default and least-inspired approach to everything innocent that's ever been made, The Wolf Among Us feels right at home. That would be an insult if not for the fact that Telltale Games, by way of Bill Willingham's strong source material, is far too talented to waste the premise on violence and grim urban reality for its own sake."", ""The premise is this: The land in which all the figures of fairy tales and folklore reside has been overrun (by a shadowy figure called The Adversary, oddly not mentioned in the game), forcing a mass exodus into the mundane--i.e., human--world. The vast majority of them settle in Fabletown, conveniently located in Manhattan, and you follow the efforts of Fabletown's elite and its sheriff, Bigby Wolf, to keep this new home from falling apart."", ""Where the game and its source material diverge is in aim and tone. Fables the comic is very much a product of its medium; it's a series of one-off mysteries, random tales of fable life, and more traditional, comic book character studies, showcasing magic just behind the scenes of a real world. The Wolf Among Us, on the other hand, is less a story of what legends and folklore figures would do with the real world than a straight, neon-colored allegory, a Dennis Lehane nursery rhyme that uses the loss of a fairy tale homeland as a jumping off point to address issues of neighborhood class struggles and possibly the best exploration of immigration that isn't Papers, Please. It's sobering, sad, and tense, and occasionally, it even has time to be magical."", ""Taking place in 1986, nearly 20 years before the events of Fables, the game's story begins with the first genuine murder to occur in Fabletown in some time. Bigby is ordered by Ichabod Crane, Fabletown's ersatz, twitchy deputy mayor, to investigate quickly and quietly. What ensues, of course, is anything but. Very little's been shaken up from Telltale's well-understood template, and it really doesn't need to be. Each scenario brings you to a new area, where you collect items, speak to others, make decisions on how Bigby reacts, and face the occasional quick-time sequence for some truly stellar, hard-hitting fights and chases. After the options are exhausted, the story advances. The pace is functional, simple, and satisfying."", 'What The Wolf Among Us brings to the table is an injection of actual detective work. Investigation does not involve the obtuse puzzle solving of Sam and Max but more resembles a simplified L.A. Noire. Liars can be called out during conversations, faces can be read, evidence collected can tell you a story, and it is indeed possible to come to incorrect conclusions and incriminate the wrong people. There are scattered moments where characters might give you a different, kinder impression of someone who may be guilty, and the seed of doubt always comes at the worst possible time. There are a few scenes in which you get to play good-cop/bad-cop, forcing you to find just the right balance of intimidation, be it verbal or frighteningly physical, without causing a suspect to completely break or clam up. Many of these decisions cannot create meaningful or at least wholly undesirable fail states, but it shows the same improvement on that score that Season 2 of The Walking Dead does, where Bigby can make a bad decision in the moment or wait too long to act, resulting in some harsh consequences down the road or the loss of already fragile trust from another character.', ""This method of operation extends to the action sequences, where Telltale's penchant for QTEs gets more room to stretch, granting multiple options for handling hostile suspects and enemies as harshly as you see fit. When Bigby gets to wolf out in later episodes, your options become downright brutal. These later episodes, especially the final one, fall back on the mechanic more than is necessary, and it's unusual to fail in a truly meaningful way, but the game is far more Heavy Rain than Dragon's Lair when compared to Telltale's previous work. In essence, if you've played one Telltale game of late, you already know how you're going to take to The Wolf Among Us."", ""It's sobering, sad, and tense, and occasionally, it even has time to be magical."", ""As always, the strength of a Telltale game rides on its story, and it shines bright here. While the cel-shaded graphics are very much 1980s four-color comic pulp come to life, the aesthetic built within them has far more latter-day Michael Mann in its blood, capturing the density of 1980s New York along with the sense of dingy isolation, backed by a minimalist, appropriately synthy score. Somehow, it's able to convey this sense even when the game is at its most grand, be it in Fabletown's lavish business offices or the shadowy lairs of its elite caste of criminals."", ""More often than not, though, the game can convey it easily because we spend so much time with Fabletown's lower classes, the folks barely scraping by. On paper, this is a story of the Big Bad Wolf trying to atone for eating people's grandmothers, blowing down houses, and all the rest of his storied mayhem, but it is ultimately a tale of displaced people, second-class citizens whom other residents don't even acknowledge and just might happen to be Grendel, Snow White, Beauty and the Beast, and the Little Mermaid. It's a strong neo-noir that gets its hands dirty just as much from the grisly violence you're investigating as it does from the ugly first-world problems of its upper crust. It's the story of working poor vs. a harried elite, filtered through the lens of long-forgotten legends and folklore. There's a moment in which an increasingly frustrated Snow White is forced to deal with the complaints of the people directly and states, We're at war! Don't they realize that? Almost instantly, you can draw from the squalid bars that people hang out in, the makeshift, threadbare funerals under bridges afforded to dead fables because there's no way to bury their dead, and the contempt that fables have for a government that is woefully unable to provide, and know that the answer to Snow's question is an emphatic no. How much that fact plays into your decisions when it comes to bending the law to help out a fellow fable is all on you."", ""And therein lies the true game at the heart of The Wolf Among Us. If The Walking Dead was ultimately determined by how you have protected Clementine's soul, the same can be said for Bigby Wolf here. The once and future Big Bad Wolf in the comics is Wolverine wearing Sam Spade's trench coat. He's brusque, cold, and brooding, and his past misdeeds weigh on him constantly. The game's Bigby less resembles Wolverine physically and is closer to Sawyer from Lost, and even if you choose the most cold-blooded choices throughout the game, the Bigby of The Wolf Among Us is a different, lighter, more human character, and he is malleable. How do you handle how Mr. Toad is unable to afford a glamour throughout the game and might be deported with a very young, innocent son? How do you treat an injured troll knowing that you're responsible for her sister's death, and by nature of the crimes, there was no way you could've done more? There's a running motif of people speaking of the old land of fables as the old neighborhood, the old times, the same way you imagine someone haranguing the hero in one of Ben Affleck's Boston crime dramas, and most of these people don't forgive The Big Bad Wolf his misdeeds. Earning their trust determines how the final, crucial moments of the season play out, and the outcomes is less about the integrity of a single character than about the heart of a community. To play Bigby is to manage a city from the inside."", ""It's the kind of game where The Big Bad Wolf and the Woodsman who saved Red Riding Hood have a nostalgic, sad drink in a bar and talk about their troubles, and the fact that it can be such a quiet, pensive moment rather than a melodramatic joke is a testament to Telltale's work. It's a triumph of tight plotting, wild imagination, and sure-handed direction. It's a game that never flinches in taking its story and its chain-smoking protagonist everywhere it can. The kind of cop we leave Episode 5 with is more a product of his environment than perhaps any other Telltale protagonist so far. Fabletown will remember that, and so will you.""]"Josiah Renaudin,2-Dec-14,Defenders of Time Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/defenders-of-time-review/1900-6415980/,7,PC,"['Defenders of Time is a wonderful tower defense game. The rush that comes from barking orders at teammates, frantically clicking different corners of the map for support, and scrambling to cobble together an effective defense during a competitive four-versus-four battle is difficult to match. The assortment of towers and upgrades gives you creative sovereignty from wave to wave, and while you might find an effective setup for a particular map on your first pass, experimenting with the placement and upgrade paths of your towers regularly leads to a better, more efficient solution. With enough practice and players, Defenders of Time is a joy.', 'Unfortunately, no ones playing this game.', 'There arent deep single-player hooks to bolster its value. I often struggled to find even one other player during my dozens of matchmaking attempts, and thats a fundamental problem for a multiplayer-focused experience. You can spend time honing your craft by playing any of the six maps by yourself, but even on the simpler stages, I struggled to keep up with the heavy workload. Defenders of Time is crippled by its diminutive player base, and thats a shame considering just how much fun it can be.', 'The action appears simple at first. Visible to the player are colored lines that connect spawn points to bases. These are paths that clusters of creatures travel down, and placing towers on top of a single line affects its direction. Cutting off specific points will completely reroute the path and lengthen it to provide additional opportunities to deal damage, but placing a tower in the wrong spot can provide creeps with a direct route to one of your bases. The most basic maps present one or two spawn points, but complex locations have you monitoring four or five different lines connected to unique bases.', 'Keeping track of it all can be dizzying. Early on, I often left certain bases completely unguarded due to my lack of map awareness, opening myself up to heavy damage. I learned not to panic, though, as making mistakes is rooted into the games design. Matches in Defenders of Time move at a clip far faster than those of other tower defense games, so you dont have time to dwell on each and every move. Effective play almost requires you to burn through your cash as soon as you earn it, and the ability to quickly sell towers--either basic or fully upgraded--gives you plenty of room for error. This need for quick thinking and decisive decision-making can be difficult to keep pace with, but after hours of experimentation, it becomes easier to both manage a map and maximize your artillery.', 'Basic towers deal minimal damage, so after accruing money by blasting enemies, its vital to upgrade these emplacements. Missile strikes, poison bursts, and chain attacks are all situationally effective, so how you build your armaments depends on the quantity and nature of creeps being sent your way. A strong grouping of area-of-effect towers might be effective when a large number of flimsy enemies arrive, but when faced with a small squadron of armored ground units, youll need to consider a completely different approach.', 'Controlling the map and preventing leaks in your defense is essential to keeping the 50 allies in your bases alive, but Defenders of Time isnt all about defense. Each team holds an assigned Commander responsible for unlocking tower upgrades and unleashing creeps onto the opposing team. If your opposition has a rock solid ground defense, a swarm of flying creatures will likely slip through the cracks and chip away at their allies. The Commander needs to keep a careful eye on the enemys map, but the whole operation will fail if the remainder of the team isnt effectively communicating what upgrades should be unlocked next.', 'The role of Commander is assigned to the player with the most games (and wins) under his or her belt, since directing the offense and defense demands a mastery of the mechanics and clear understanding of the maps. In a full game, the Commander is only in control of the upgrade path and creep dispersal. He or she can mark different spots on the map where towers should be built or use voice chat to suggest strategies, but actually placing and upgrading towers is up to the rest of the team. However, if there are fewer than four players, the Commander holds all the aforementioned responsibilities in addition to tower placement. Its a mentally demanding role, and one that only a high-level player should attempt if they hope to come out with a win.', 'It takes a significant amount of time to feel fully comfortable with the mechanics and understand the advantages of each tower upgrade, and regrettably, the in-game tutorials dont do you any favors. Short explanations of how to place towers and fulfill the Commander role are available, but actual explanations for the different upgrades and enemy types are reduced to text on the games website. If youre looking for tips on how to extend spawn lines, combat certain waves of creeps, or approach the intricate maps, youll either have to suffer through hours of practice rounds or pair up with a more knowledgeable player.', ' ', 'Of course, its hard to find good teachers when few have had a chance to study the material. No ones online, so youre left banging your head against the mechanics until you understand what youre supposed to do to survive from wave to wave. Owners of the game can invite their friends to download a demo version and join them as long as theyre online, but unless you have a large group of friends with PCs and a love of tower defense, this isnt a viable solution. Theres a certain satisfaction that comes from crafting unique strategies and finding your favorite combinations of towers, but the lack of a true tutorial, paired with the absence of additional online players, can make Defenders of Time feel opaque.', 'Its a shame, too. Defenders of Time is one of the smartest, most interesting tower defense games in recent memory, and while there isnt a bevy of maps to be found, the strategic variety allowed by each zone ensures hours upon hours of enjoyment. Without a supporting cast of teammates or a proper tutorial, though, few will be able to see what this games all about. If you have enough friends to fill up a lobby, theres plenty of fun to be had with Defenders of Time. Otherwise, youll be left angrily waiting around for someone, anyone, to jump online.', ' ']"Alexa Ray Corriea,1-Dec-14,Game of Thrones: A Telltale Games Series Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/game-of-thrones-episode-one-iron-from-ice-review/1900-6415979/,8,PS4,"['The first major decision you make in Telltales Game of Thrones breaks you. Its a deceptively complicated choice, a choice you second-guess for the entirety of the two-hour opening episode. You would think that making a choice between, say, saving one life and saving many lives would be simple. You have to do whats best for the house you serve, right? But what if its not the best thing for you, personally? What is more important: self-preservation or your lords legacy?', ""When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground. So says Cersei Lannister in the HBO television series Telltales game is based on, which itself is based on George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire books. Game of Thrones makes you participate in the twisted machinations of said game of thrones in an attempt to protect the reputation and ensure the survival of your family, House Forrester. The Forresters have long served House Stark, a house that is already rapidly spiraling into bad favor when the first episode opens. This places the Forresters in an already precarious political situation, which in predictable Game of Thrones fashion, only gets worse."", 'Thrones story begins just as the War of the Five Kings is heating up. Five lords all seek to claim the Iron Throne and assume kingship over Westeros. The political climate is hot with peril and tensions are strung so high that lords and handmaidens must choose every word carefully, on pain of losing their status and life if they so much as look the wrong way at someone in power.', ""This stress hangs over everyone involved in the delicate dance of fighting for kingship, but Telltales Thrones perfectly communicates the anxiety by focusing on a smaller house that is not directly in the limelight. House Forrester is no House Stark in stature, but in terms of familial loyalty, duty and love, this family is very similar to the ill-fated Wardens of the North. House Forrester is still vital to Westeros, however, as the family controls the majority of the worlds Ironwood, a strain of wood that is in high demand for its durability and strength. These groves of Ironwood are just one more thing you need to keep track of as you guide the Forresters through precarious situations with other lords and ladies. You play as three members affiliated with House Forrester, and the three in question will change with each episode. Telltales tried-and-true branching dialogue choices are present in Game of Thrones, along with its simple analog stick shifting and button mashes to maneuver through fights. And there are quite a few fights in this first episode. Prompts appear for trigger-presses that end with the swing of a greatsword or the stab of a pitchfork. Sometimes these prompts call for frantic button mashing to escape burning debris or wrestle out of a soldier's grip."", 'Game of Thrones is less about combat and more about verbal parlaying. The emphasis on talking is very much a Thrones thing; just as in the show and books, words carry a weight that can make or break your fate. One wrong word to Joffrey and youre executed on the spot. A flippant comment to Littlefinger and youre as good as ruined. Failing to curry favor with Margaery, Cersei, or any other powerful lady in court could spell doom for you when you most need help.', 'Game of Thrones successfully recreates this panic in game form, dropping you in the middle of sticky situations that will be familiar to you if you know the source material. The most chilling of these scenes involves you having to talk your way into favor with a certain unpredictable highborn woman. Your dialogue options suggest that you can lie outright and say everything she wants to hear by feigning absolute loyalty, profess loyalty to the lady you serve and risk bringing mistrust on your head, or go all-in, defending your house and the North in exchange for what could be a horrendous punishment. This scene is the essence of what Game of Thrones tries to convey, a healthy amount of fear coupled with the responsibility to protect your family from extinction.', ""Every decision you make matters. Everything you do has a consequence, not just for you, but for the house you belong to or the people you serve. If you a kill a man belonging to a rival house, you can bet that rival house will want vengeance. If you reveal your secret plans to another handmaiden, someone else will find out. And if you ask the wrong person to use his or her power to help you, it could not only bring misfortune onto you but onto your new ally as well, affecting your relationship. The Game of Thrones show paints pictures of a ripple effect that never stops rippling, and this same effect is an omnipresent thing in the game. It's difficult to explain without spoiling some very intricate political clockwork, but the game does an excellent job of stage-setting in a way that makes it immediately apparent every choice will haunt you later."", ""There are a lot of small details in Iron from Ice, many brief moments and markers that you may miss, at first, due to the episodes slow pacing. Game of Thrones starts at a slow-burn, with an opening episode that is almost entirely stage-setting for the five more episodes to come. Its never boring, but there are a few scenes that feel a little too long with slow-moving dialogue. For example, a shouting match against a rival lord that won't take no for an answer runs in circles; he asks for what he wants, you say no, he says he won't leave without it, you offer something else, he says no, you have the option to lie to or yell at him, he goes back to his original argument. The pacing is very George R. R. Martin-esque, but in the context of a game it dissipates the momentum. However, these stretches of quieter scenes are worth it when you get to the more heart-pounding climaxes of each playable characters tale."", 'One of the biggest charms of Game of Thrones is being a part of major events from the show. Its exciting (and also sometimes devastating) to fight in familiar battles or chat with well-known characters. These longtime characters are also voiced by their show actors, adding a deeper thrill to these encounters. I was tingling after completing a scene featuring the sadistic Ramsay Snow--I was on edge, my body completely tense. I didnt realize I had been sitting completely still, barely breathing with mouth agape as I tried to tell Ramsay all the right things that would just make him go away. Its moments like these that make you feel as though youre right there in the show, with Ramsay Snow breathing death in your eyes and waving a dagger underneath your nose.', 'Recreating the sense of anxiety-riddled anticipating that the show is known for is one of the better things going for Telltales Thrones, but the best is the Forresters themselves. Spending time with Margaery Tyrell or Tyrion Lannister is enjoyable, but whenever the action turns to these characters you instantly want them to leave. The Forresters are a heartwarming, earthy group that epitomize Telltales knack for creating deep, attractive characters. They, like the Starks, are in a bad place due to a poorly-dealt hand of fate, and their plight, the central story, is genuinely gut-wrenching, horrific, and real.', 'You grow to love these characters because of the brave faces they try to put on and the doubt and pain that nearly destroy them. Its hard to name one character who does not change in some way due to the events of Iron from Ice, and that character development is both a reflection of author George R.R. Martins character design influence and Telltale Games ability to birth beautiful broken people that you want to spend time with. You come for Tyrion and Cersei, but you stay for the Forresters.', 'Telltale has again successfully paired itself with a franchise that knows how to wring emotion from its audience. Game of Thrones is off to a slow but not uneventful start, with an almost unfairly large heap of teases and promises for the next episode. The pacing is true to its source material--slow, taking its own time--but the payoff for major scenes is worth wading through. If the show makes you scream, the game will make you scream, because its difficult not to get wrapped up in the struggle to serve and hold up your house. Its a game about family told in perhaps the most un-family-friendly environment in fantasy fiction, and in a way that will leave you sick with delight and sadness as the credits roll.']"Peter Brown,1-Dec-14,Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/captain-toad-treasure-tracker-review/1900-6415978/,8,Wii U,"[""The bite-sized Captain Toad stages in Super Mario 3D World were a wonderful side dish, offering a very different type of challenge from the rest of the game. Little did we know at the time that the compact, puzzle-like levels would eventually find new life in a full-fledged game, Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker. Now, Captain Toad and Toadette, his partner in plunder, have hit the road on a quest of their own, and it's one of the most charming and enjoyable games to grace the Wii U. The two tiny explorers squawk and trot to all corners of the Mushroom Kingdom in search of golden treasure, and occasionally to rescue each other from danger. While it has a gleeful exterior, Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker's also a deceptively challenging romp, especially if you attempt to uncover all of the game's hidden items."", ""The Toads' outing is distinct from other adventures in the Mario universe for many reasons, but one in particular stands out: their abilities are pared down to the basics. They can't jump, and they don't take on any super-powered transformations. All they can do is walk, climb ladders, throw turnips, and use their headlamps to fend off ghosts. Such simplicity may sound boring, but it works because you're more reliant on elements in the world than your abilities to get from A to B. You ultimately seek items that are nestled in hard-to-reach corners of levels that are dense with paths and possibilities. Ladders, ramps, and moving platforms may yield an avenue to the stage's goal, a golden star, or they could be false leads. Deciphering all of the interconnecting parts of each stage requires a fair amount of abstract thought and mental coordination."", ""Understanding the lay of the land requires you to rotate the camera around the given stage, which, nine times out of ten, fits within the confines of the screen. Should you need a closer look at your surroundings, a quick button press makes the camera zoom in on Toad's location. Hidden nooks reveal themselves in unexpected places, but quite often, there's nary an entrance in sight. In order to access these tempting treasure holds, you sometimes have to interact with the GamePad's touchscreen to move sliding objects or spin wheels to raise platforms. It's one of the few games that's best played on the GamePad alone, where you can easily see all of the game's visual cues."", ""The Toads' adventure is fraught with more than just puzzles; goombas, ghosts, and butt-stomping birds are just some of the enemies that stand in your way, and they can be especially threatening when you're busy manipulating the stage around you via the GamePad. If you're quick enough, however, you can tap the screen and stun them in their tracks. As in most games set in the Mario universe, it takes two blows from an enemy to bring you down. One hit causes you to shrink, and the next will cost you a life and force you to restart the level, unless you manage to find one of the series' iconic red mushrooms. Yet, you never feel like your progress is in jeopardy. Even if you lose all of your lives, the game sets you up in a cave with a tiny field of plants that yield 1-UP mushrooms so that you can replenish your stock before continuing where you left off. It begs the question: why have a life system at all?"", ""You don't spend much time wracking your brain to find a path to the goal in each stage, but you find yourself stumped when searching for hidden gems. At first, you assume these are optional, and possibly forego excavating them in order to progress forward, but you eventually need a certain amount of gems to open new stages. Some backtracking is needed, and while this may be a boring task in other games, the smooth pace at which the difficulty ramps up in Captain Toad provides the skills to tackle puzzles from the past that may have been too tricky during the first run. It's validating and rewarding when you deftly uncover secrets and realize that you've actually learned a thing or two over the course of the game."", ""Once in a while, you take a trip in a minecart, which is filled with turnips that you can toss at enemies and bricks. These moments are a nice respite from puzzle solving, as all you're expected to do is fire away at your surroundings and hang on for the ride, but there are still gems to find, so you need to keep your wits about you and keep an eye out as you whip around mountain peaks, being sure to target everything in sight in a timely manner. There are also bonus levels to enjoy after you complete certain levels that net you extra lives and coins. You occasionally unlock these stages by thoroughly completing full-fledged levels, and you have two options once you enter: wield a pickaxe and plow through fields of turnips for rewards, or pick up cherry multiplier items, which create clones of Toad or Toadette, and slide down ramps to collect extra lives."", ""Two bosses appear multiple times throughout the game, including a fire-breathing dragon in a rising lava pit, and an evil bird, Wingo, who just loves to kidnap Toads. Every time you face one or the other, the respective challenge evolves gracefully, requiring stricter timing and attention to your surroundings than before. However, save for the final battle, they aren't difficult."", ""In order to totally complete most levels, you need to find every gem and get to the star under extreme constraints. Sometimes that means stealthily slipping past enemies without alerting them; or you're challenged to find a golden mushroom in an unlikely place that's invisible save for a faint sparkle. For the true treasure tracker, there are plenty of challenges that ask you to look at old stages in new ways, and these are the most challenging moments in the game."", ""If you happen to have Super Mario 3D World saves on your Wii U, you're automatically treated to a selection of bonus levels taken right from that game, but even if you haven't played 3D World, fear not, because the same levels open up once you complete the main Treasure Tracker chapters. There's nothing wrong with extra gameplay, but these stages aren't as mentally stimulating as the main game. Toad and Toadette's journey is so interesting because the puzzles and stages are designed around their limited abilities, and almost every moment is spent solving a small part of a larger puzzle. While the bonus stages are adapted to suit the Toads' skillset with the introduction of ladders and moving platforms, they don't embody the puzzle-like structure that makes the rest of the game so great. You still get to enjoy an extended romp through the Mushroom Kingdom, but it's different and less appealing than the primary adventure."", ""Were Captain Toad's world not so appealing, it would be easy to grow tired of the repeat playthroughs if you need to go back and collect items like I did, but the cartoony, whimsical Mushroom Kingdom is easy to love, with layer upon layer of charm. From goombas in swim rings that flap their little feet underwater, to the tiny birds that land on Toad's head when he's idly wasting time, Treasure Tracker has a lighthearted and lovable presentation. It has the right mix of atmosphere and challenging puzzles to keep you engaged, and it's a great experiment within the larger Mario universe. It may have started out as a minigame, but with its original take on the Toad character and a large number of enjoyably tricky puzzles, it's great to see it in the spotlight it so truly deserves."", ' ']"Kevin VanOrd,26-Nov-14,Geometry Wars 3: Dimensions Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/geometry-wars-3-dimensions-review/1900-6415977/,8,Xbox One,"[""It is 2:00 a.m., my right thumb is sore and my brain is fried, yet I cannot sleep--not just yet. I am staring at two numbers in the millions, one of which is higher than the other. The higher number belongs to a colleague at another publication. By day, we are friends and peers; by night, we participate in a grueling display of one-upsmanship and vain preening, working to best each others' Geometry Wars 3: Dimensions scores. And I cannot abide by this discrepancy. Clearly, I must prove my superiority."", ""Geometry Wars 3 is about that endless quest to best friends and strangers. As you work your way through the single-player progression or toy around with the returning modes from Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved 2 and its predecessor, your focus may be on the onscreen fireworks display, but it's the promise of rising up the leaderboards that compels you. You use the left stick on your controller to move your minimalist vessel across the playing grid; you use the right to shoot a constant stream of projectiles in whatever direction you push. Green diamonds, yellow arrows, purple pinwheels, and all sorts of other geometric structures swarm you from every side, each shape following a particular pattern through space. Your brain and your thumbs are fully engaged with the process of mowing them down to the point that mind and muscle become one. You react to events before you understand them, yet there is a miniscule segment of your gray matter always devoted to the score you hope to reach."", ""Score-chasing is rarely so elegant. Numerical goals are always visible on screen, and should a level end before you meet your challenge, it's quick and easy to restart the stage and try again. Yet while the promise of gloating over your friends is primary to Geometry Wars 3's appeal, that appeal would be diminished were the action itself not so refined. This dual-stick shooter controls like a dream, responding to your nudges and wiggles with exceptional grace. All the while, the soundtrack recalls Jan Hammer and Daft Punk, forcing you ever onward while giving even the early seconds of each level a sense of nervous urgency."", 'You could have described the awesome Geometry Wars 2 with similar praise, and that game\'s best modes are represented once again, all under the guise of ""Classic Mode."" Evolved is a time-honored tradition among shooter-lovers and loses little of its chaotic seductiveness. It\'s Pacifism that remains the most interesting of the returning styles, however, in that it removes shooting from the Euclidean equation entirely and has you traveling through neon gates that explode when you travel through them, and in the process, take down the alarming number of the pulsing cyan prisms pursuing you. The mode may be called Pacifism, but you aren\'t likely to feel very peaceful while you play. Success here means taking dangerous chances, allowing dozens of shapes to encircle you in the hopes of annihilating great numbers of them at once. Or, perhaps, zooming through the cloud of blue detritus that those shapes leave behind when destroyed, and cursing the busy visuals that obscure the perils that lurk behind the proliferating particles.', ""Adventure Mode is at the forefront, however, and it is the mode that most deviates from the Geometry Wars formula. For one, it provides structural progression, granting you currency that you then spend on drones (and drone upgrades). Drones accompany you as you flit about the arena, perhaps adding to your firepower, perhaps sniping foes from a distance, perhaps collecting the green geoms that vanquished shapes leave behind. Then there are supers, special abilities that join your arena-clearing bomb, and have you dropping mines, spewing out homing missiles, or placing a highly powerful automatic turret. Adventure Mode's other deviation is in the levels themselves, which are no longer just flat arenas, but wrap into three-dimensional constructs. Some arenas take the form of globes; others are shaped like peanuts or cylinders. Sometimes, additional idiosyncrasies are mixed in, such as walls that gradually close in on you, or bosses that belch aggressive geometry and chase you around the playing field."", ""Both diversions change Geometry Wars in fundamental ways. Where the unlock system is concerned, not all players are on level ground when playing a stage. You won't have the same abilities the first time you play a stage as you might when you return to it to shoot for a higher score. This adjustment inspires you to return once you've earned powerful drones--but it also strikes at the heart of the series. One of Geometry Wars 2's greatest assets was its purity: it was by skill, and skill alone, that you triumphed. There's less joy in rising to the top of the leaderboards when most of the players lurking under you conquered the level with lesser equipment. I glowed when I saw my name at the top of Adventure Mode's very first stage, but I didn't really earn my place at the head of the table. Classic Mode grants you a more accurate picture of your abilities, and though those leaderboards might crush your soul, it's a great pleasure to claw your way to the top--a pleasure Adventure Mode doesn't duplicate in spite of its own natural addictiveness."", 'The soundtrack recalls Jan Hammer and Daft Punk, forcing you ever onward while giving even the early seconds of each level a sense of nervous urgency.', ""The wraparound levels are home to some creative challenges. In many cases, the arrangement and order of the shapes that spawn into the arena are fixed, thus establishing specific gameplay rhythms. A stage might have you continuously zipping around a volumetric curve, carefully navigating a cube that flips around as you approach its edges, or avoiding oscillating platforms that destroy you with a single touch. Discovering how to exploit these rhythms is one of Geometry Wars 3's great challenges, for it's in that rhythm that is hidden that elusive high score. This is an uncommon brand of trial and error in the series, Waves mode notwithstanding, for you are rewarded just as much for your ability to recognize and memorize patterns as you are for your quick reactions to the game's variables."", ""Geometry Wars 3 is absorbing regardless, though I can't in good faith claim that its additions make this sequel surpass its predecessor. Concerns of equal footing among players aside, some quirks also poke at the elements that made Geometry Wars 2 a case study in arcade austerity. In King Mode, for example, the circles that signal a safe space have been stretched into three-dimensional domes, complete with unnecessary rotating details, whose boundaries aren't as clear as they should be. Elsewhere, the returning red-and-blue diamonds that prove so often deadly in late-game fireworks no longer announce their presence via sound effects, leading to deaths that don't feel particularly fair, in part because the entirety of the stage doesn't appear on screen, and thus the shape's sudden appearance leaves no time to react. In the past, the series' visual clutter came from the vibrant particles that painted the screen. Now, it's the 3D visualizations, tilting surfaces, and warping effects that prove distracting, and often more so."", ' ', ""You can crank up the distractions (and the tension) in four-player cooperative play, which leads you through a mini-adventure of its own, as well as a bit of squabbling as you face the fun (and challenging) mode-ending boss. (Sadly, there is no cooperative Classic Mode.) Your dreams of online cooperation still go unrealized, but you can still take the enjoyment online in the form of two different competitive modes, which pit two teams of up to four players against each other in a high-score showdown. These modes are sadly underpopulated to the extent that you might not find a match, which is a shame, considering how unusual and energetic they are. In Stock Mode, for instance, you must gather ammo drops to beat a crystalline boss, which means you and your opponents remain in constant motion, battling not only to survive and collect, but also to reduce each others' collective ammo pools. There is consolation here, however: online battles are a blast even when you're competing in lonely teams of one player each."", ""But it's the leaderboard competition that remains at the heart of the series, in spite of Geometry Wars 3's tweaking and twisting of the blueprint. Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved 2 remains an almost-perfect example of its genre; Geometry Wars 3, in its reliance on unlockables, feels less confident in its foundation, adding embellishment where none was needed. My thumb, however, stands testament to the game's greatness, throbbing in pain as I enter the seventh consecutive hour of geometric action. Tomorrow, I will look at my swollen digit and promise myself to lay off the Geometry Wars 3: Dimensions. But such are the game's absorbing attributes that I will break that promise before the day passes."", ' ']"Alexa Ray Corriea,24-Nov-14,Tales from the Borderlands: A Telltale Game Series Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tales-from-the-borderlands-episode-one-zer0-sum/1900-6415974/,9,PS4,"['Tales from the Borderlands is brilliant proof that professional fan fiction can be a beautiful thing. The first episode ""Zer0 Sum"" sets a high entry bar into the series but one that\'s fun to surmount. If you come looking for the simmering anxiety of The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us, you will find none of that here. Instead, you get an adrenaline-fueled circus of frantic smooth-talk and constant motion that is definitively Borderlands from top to bottom. Telltale has masterfully set up a plot that feels like a Borderlands campaign. It moves between plot points with little downtime in between, and with each scene feeling like a rapid uphill sprint. Rarely do conversations exceed five minutes, and the two longest dialogue-focused scenes are tense, high-strung affairs. The sense of urgency hanging over every conversation makes response time for dialogue choices feel shorter, stringing you through negotiations with criminals and attempts to smooth over verbal blunders.', ""Borderlands games are about shooting and looting. You do both of these in Tales, because nestled within its narrative-based nature you confront several lengthy action sequences. The first episode alone features brutal skirmishes resulting in more than a few exploded heads. While there is no shooting in the traditional Borderlands sense--you won't run around gunning down Psychos or skags--there are opportunities to operate heavy machinery and fire off a round. These scenarios require fingers always on thumbsticks, chaining together the familiar moving and ducking commands from Telltale's previous episodic games. So when you're not moving analogue sticks to dodge-roll away from cleaver-wielding bandits, you're mashing buttons to break a guard's neck or bash Psychos in the face. You're running away, jumping onto moving vehicles, grasping for weapons, and slamming them into an attacker's face, and dodging bullets. You aren't given the luxury of mulling decisions for long. Motion is constant, because nothing on Pandora waits for anyone. It's incredibly satisfying to wrap up a 20-minute vehicle chase with a few explosions and an axe kill or two to a face before moving on. And unlike in Telltale's other games, when dealing with others, silence is rarely a good option."", 'As in other Telltale games, players have a limited amount of time to select one of four dialogue or action options when dealing with other characters. The way the studio has tweaked its choice system for Tales from the Borderlands adds another layer of depth to an already complex feature. Both Rhys and Fiona are telling their side of a tale and, as a result, provide different (and sometimes conflicting) details about what happened. You get the opportunity to control both of them, offering your own take on the character.', ""Rhys is a Hyperion employee, and everyone on Pandora hates the company. He's viewed as another cog in a machine that destroys lives. Other characters have a real beef with Hyperion as well, and these prejudices dictate how they interact with Rhys. As Rhys, you have to choose whether to flaunt that powerful connection or appeal to others by being vulnerable, telling them how the company has screwed you over too. Fiona appears to have little vulnerability other than love for family, but it's up to you how successful she is as a con artist. You can dissemble to save your skin, but Tales does an amazing job of forcing you to think hard about who to throw under the bus and how badly your actions will bite you in the ass later. The game begins with the pair being interrogated, each asking for their side of a story involving an elaborate con and a lot of money. That's about all I can say, as the story takes off so quickly that anything else would be a spoiler. The openness with which the two characters are written adds to the player's responsibility. Because of the openness of choice here--two noted liars spinning their own stories within a narrative path determined by the player--more than ever, this is your story to tell."", ""Unfortunately, the supporting cast in this first episode feels less real than Fiona and Rhys. Vaughn, Rhys's sidekick, often overshoots funny into annoying. Villain August doesn't feel threatening just yet, and Fiona's sister Sasha tends to ping-pong emotionally. The one exception is the bandit lord Bossanova, who appears only briefly but adds a bright splash of Borderlands-baddie flavor to the whole affair."", ""You also get to tinker with some technology from the mega-corporation Hyperion. Rhys has an Echo Eye, an implant that allows him to scan objects in exploration sequences for more information. The Eye is used to gather more information about the environment and reveal more objects to click on and interact with. Rhys also gets to build and choose equipment for a Loader Bot, a self-aware piece of machinery that fights for you. You pick his equipment--grenades and a riot shield, for example--and let him loose, occasionally taking control from his perspective to shoot bandits. Other cyborg implants on Rhys allow him to hack systems, uncovering sensitive information pertinent to the plot by snooping his boss's computer screen or sifting through a stronghold's security system. It's a nice, smart touch."", ""Telltale's Pandora is beautifully realized. The cel-shaded art works perfectly, and several times during my playthrough I forgot I was looking at a game that wasn't from Gearbox's canon. I rode in a lightning-fast car across Pandora's surface, kicking up sand into a glowing sky and whizzing past brightly-colored billboards and slavering skags. I stood in the pit of a dingy, dusty battle arena, alone in a maze of dazzling debris as fluorescent spotlights beat down on me."", 'But it\'s not just the look, it\'s the sound too. Dialogue moves at a fast clip and retains the same dark humor that colors Borderlands. Sometimes jokes are a little cringe-worthy, but the wit is there, along with several well-placed gems. Fiona muttering jibberish and trying to imitate a Psycho, Rhys sweet talking another character and ""blowing his mind"" by moving him to tears, and a character using a voice-distortion machine to mask his high-pitched squeaky voice all made me audibly giggle-snort. Snark and smarm are ever-present in the tone, but characters don\'t sound like they\'re trying too hard to be funny. The writing just works, as Telltale nails another pillar of the Borderlands aesthetic.', ""I would be remiss not to mention the superb Tales soundtrack, which feels like something pulled right out of a Borderlands score. Jared Emerson-Johnson, who scored both The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us for Telltale, has created tracks that make one think of bloody chases across Pandora's sandy surface and the violent clang of bullets and machetes on steel. During a scene in which Rhys summons a Loader Bot to help take out a group of bandits, the music swells to a pounding half-rock, half-techno frenzy that brought me back to my first firefights in the first Borderlands. Everything about the soundtrack is Borderlands--the tonal ambience inexorably drags you into battles and inspires them to press on."", ""Telltale and Borderlands are the peanut butter and chocolate of the current gaming landscape, creating a piece that is too rock-solid in its own convictions to be labeled simply as a mashup. It's hard to even call it professional fan fiction. Tales from the Borderlands is a Borderlands game, but Telltale has opened up Gearbox's Pandora in a way the original Borderlands games haven't and can't as shooters. Through exploration of the little people struggling in the shadows of Vault Hunters, you gain deeper opportunities to explore the world.""]"Daniel Starkey,24-Nov-14,Super Smash Bros. for Wii U Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/super-smash-bros-for-wii-u-review/1900-6415976/,9,Wii U,"['In some respects, Smash for Wii U is the same game released on the 3DS two months ago: it has the same characters, same premise, and same reverence for gaming history. The fundamental difference is in the depth of the experience. The Wii U Smash has tighter controls, better action, more options for single- and multiplayer, more remixes of classic Nintendo songs, more stages, more customization, stage builders--the list goes on. The Wii U version is the definitive Smash Bros. experience.', ""At its most basic level, Smash Bros. is what youd get if you built a game on the premise of settling the classic question, I wonder whod win in a fight: Mario or Link? You and your opponents choose whichever character you like from Nintendos staggering roster of 49 fighters and enter the fray. Damage works in a unique and slightly obtuse way. In stark contrast with most fighting games, you dont have a limited pool of health that depletes as you take damage. Instead, your health counts upwards, and the more hits you take, the further you're sent flying when hit again. The goal of any given match is to knock your opponents off the stage and prevent them from safely returning."", ' ', 'This series presents a challenge unique to the Smash Bros. series: recovery. If you are simply knocked from a platform or fall off by accident, its usually easy enough to make it back. Every character has at least two jump moves, and almost all of them have an additional emergency technique for covering large distances. Mindlessly knocking around opponents rarely clinches you a victory. Depending upon how well your opponent can predict your movements, its entirely possible and often advised to trick adversaries into falling off the stage for an easy knockout. The amazing depth and variety of this system is at the heart of Smash, and its marriage of the ridiculous and the serious, and the casual and the competitive, is what sets it apart from other adversarial games.', 'The disparity between the portable and console versions of the game is both immediately apparent and stunning, and making the jump to the Wii U version is freeing. On the pint-sized 3DS, some characters are clearly more comfortable to control than others; given the Wii Us option to use seven different kinds of controllers, most Smash enthusiasts can immediately and competently play as just about anyone. If you struggled to use Mega Man to his fullest potential on the 3DS, you will enjoy the ease with which you can guide him now. Everyone from Samus to Wii Fit Trainer, Villager to Mario, responds with impressive ease.', 'Each time you select someone with whom youre unfamiliar, its like being given a brand-new toolbox. You wont know how to use every move immediately, but they all have a purpose. Your role is to learn when and where to use each skill. As with competitive martial arts, much of the match relies on carefully watching your opponent, maintaining your own balance, and being constantly ready to punish a mistake. At every step in the process, you have some degree of control.', 'That focus on fine control dovetails perfectly with many of Smash Bros.\' new mechanics. Ledge guarding, a staple in Smash 64, Melee, and Brawl, has been removed. This pushes a lot of the combat off the stage, requiring stronger aerial play. While most moves also knock foes farther than they used to, each character generally only has two or three solid ""killing moves."" That means that knockouts require substantially more skill to execute cleanly, which in turn, translates into a distinct cut between high-level and low-level players. These changes benefit everyone. Casual players are able to survive much longer than they may be used to, making sure they arent left out of the game entirely. Professional-level brawlers still have the skill set necessary to dominate the less experienced, but cheap kills amongst one another are less common. This tight balance helps satisfy every kind of fan, without cheapening the experience for any one group. This philosophy defines Smash Bros. for Wii U.', 'Everyone from Samus to Wii Fit Trainer, Villager to Mario, responds with impressive ease.', 'Keeping a competitive game open for the inexperienced, but giving advanced folks the opportunity to spread their wings, is a challenge that requires an enormous number of options and plenty of ways to train and refine skill sets. Super Smash Bros. for Wii U is packed with dozens of challenges, training modes and minigames. These modes arent pointless additions. Event matches and challenges have you trying new approaches with characters you arent used to--often to teach you something you may have never learned otherwise. The Homerun Contest, for example, has you building up damage over ten seconds before knocking it as far as you possibly can. While it seems a bit odd, it actually helps you build a better understanding of how characters react to receiving damage, and how different techniques affect the trajectory at which you can launch enemies. There several specific distance goals, like R.O.B. having to hit the sandbag between 1600 and 1656 feet. To complete the challenge properly, you must develop a deep understanding of which attacks knock the bag too far away to continue your combo.', 'Event matches are less structured, but they often pit you against unusual or overwhelming odds and force you to adapt in order to progress. In one of the toughest events, you play as Falco and prevent a stream of Mr. Game and Watches from touching down even once on the stage. While you can approach the goal in a few different ways, you quickly discover that aerial attacks are one of Falcos best choices, as they allowed you to deal with incoming foes more quickly with less downtime between attacks. There are hundreds of these types of skill tests, and they are designed to help you familiarize yourself with as many characters as youre willing to learn. Even if you dont end up ever using Falco, the events still give you enough experience with the games 49 characters that you know what your foes are capable of, and can then modify your approach accordingly.', 'If you have an Amiibo, then youve got yet another option to practice. Amiibo work like customizable AI opponents: you can change out numerous attacks, manipulate their names and appearance, and ""feed"" them equipment to make them stronger. For the most part, they grow by battling other people or Amiibo, and allegedly learn and adapt to better handle other peoples playstyles. Im far from the best Smash player out there, but Im better than most, and I struggled to deal with max-level Amiibo figures. When I switched from my typically aggressive style to a more defensive one, the Amiibo would respond either by baiting me to attack or by spamming ranged attacks to try and create an opening so that they could punish me. Amiibos arent unbeatable, but their attacks do a lot more damage than yours, and a good chunk of their difficulty seems to come from that. If you dont have friends around and tire of the single-player options, an Amiibo is a great addition for all but the most talented Smash players, even if they are a little pricey.', 'For most players, the goal of this single-player training is to test your skills against friends, and thats where Smash Bros. for Wii U excels. Eight-player matches are phenomenal. Turning item drops up to high and cramming eight players into a relatively small space results in the kind of unbridled lunacy Ive come to love from Smash Bros. If you prefer the action to be a bit more tame, you can still play standard matches with four combatants, and thats as great as its always been. There are quite a few new stages in which to slug it out, and more than enough to provide a good variety for just about anyone. The most interesting stages, of course, are those that change dramatically over the course of a match. They force players to keep up with the shift, and as long as youre not looking for serious competition, its always hilarious to watch unwitting folks fall off the stage because they werent expecting the bottom of the level to suddenly drop away.', 'All of these stages are wonderfully rendered and keep multiplayer matches from losing their luster even after countless hours.', 'In that vein, Yoshis Wooly World, Kalos Pokemon League, and Mushroom Kingdom U are standouts. They all have new stage hazards like flaming pillars, or a pool that makes your fighter metallic, or a guy that tries to stuff you in a sack and jump off the level, resulting in an instant death. All of these stages are wonderfully rendered and keep multiplayer matches from losing their luster even after countless hours, though you can always use the Wii U gamepad to create your own levels if you seek even more diversity. There are too many restrictions on size and too few tools available, but drawing ridiculous levels with the touchpad more than makes up for the limitations. Disappointingly, you cant conduct eight-player matches on custom stages, which is a missed opportunity for even crazier play.', 'Online multiplayer is an unfortunate stain on an otherwise stellar game. Lag in online Smash Bros. matches is hugely variable. Some online games chug along at a mere five frames or fewer per second or less, rendering the game completely unplayable. Others are almost as smooth as if you were playing locally. Playing with friends with solid Internet connections may help, but even so, theres no knowing how any given match might perform. Online play is extremely hit-or-miss, with the misses being absolutely maddening.', 'Poor internet functionality is, thankfully, a blight on an otherwise incredible game. Between the Masterpiece Collections, which are short demos of the classic games that inspired Smash Bros., the many fighters and stages, the deep character customization for fine-tuning your fighters to suit your play style, and the extensive screenshot editing tools, theres just so much to do. With the Wii U release, Smash Bros. has fully realized its goals. Theres something here for nearly everyone--from young to old, from novice to expert--presented almost without compromise. Super Smash Bros. Wii U invites everyone to join in its undiluted, joyous celebration of the broad community that Nintendo has built over the past forty years.', ' ']"Brett Todd,24-Nov-14,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-binding-of-isaac-rebirth-review/1900-6415971/,8,PC,"[""It's creepy, blasphemous, and obsessed with poo. Despite all that, good luck walking away from The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth. This remake of the scatological 2012 original from developer Edmund McMillen (best known for Super Meat Boy) doubles down on the dementia with even more surreal power-ups and bizarre enemies. I still don't know exactly what I've been playing for the last six or seven hours non-stop, but I know that I liked it and that I want to go back for more."", ""Actually, Rebirth is easy to categorize on the surface. The game is a basic roguelike, with tips of the hat to the frenzied combat in Robotron. The feel is decidedly old-school in that the top-down maps are randomly generated and you have to plow through the entire game in one sitting (so don't die, or you're going right back to the beginning). If you've ever played a classic arcade game, you know the drill. You run around constantly, shoot everything that moves, and grab power-ups. Repeat through each level until you kill the end boss or die and start all over again a little bit older and little bit wiser."", ' ', ""But that stock description sells the game short. From here, things get strange. Really strange. Instead of the usual warrior elf or whatever, you play a little boy named Isaac. Sound kind of sweet? It isn't. Isaac is on the run from his mother, who has some kind of prophecy/mental meltdown in the stick-figure opening cinematic and tries to kill her son on the orders of God. Apparently, taking away the kid's Game Boy and toys isn't enough for old Jehovah, who insists on mom doing the Abraham thing and sacrificing her son to prove her love. Just before mom bursts into Isaac's bedroom with a butcher knife, though, he escapes down a hatchway into a creepy basement, and the game is on."", ""So if you've spent time in a cult or have any sort of mother issues, you might want to close your eyes during the intro video. And maybe later on, too. Finishing each level earns the questionable reward of a new cinematic, which always features some horrific nightmare like other kids pooping on Isaac, his mother constantly kicking him away, him falling to his death, and someone handing him a gift box filled with (what else?) poop. The game also continually ventures back into strange Christian references. Isaac seems pulled between good and evil. At times, the game veers toward the Satanic, with various demonic options and power-ups. At other times, it shows an internal struggle as Isaac takes on various doppelganger foes representing deadly sins like sloth and envy. The game always goes out of its way to be unique and maybe make you think that it has a deeper message, even when it almost certainly doesn't."", ""It's creepy, blasphemous, and obsessed with poo. Despite all that, good luck walking away from The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth."", 'McMillen really brings the weird when the game gets rolling. Isaac\'s health is tracked with hearts (you start with just three, and new ones are few and far between in the game), and his only weapon is his tears, which form into watery bullets. The basement and cave levels below the house are disturbingly filled with big piles of swirly cartoon poop (that comes in all shapes, sizes, and colors) and poop-related monsters like anthropomorphic piles of crap that fling smaller piles of crap at you and all sorts of related creepy crawlies likes flies, spiders, slugs, and so forth, along with demon spawn like animated dead babies (that frequently explode when killed, spraying bloody viscera all over the place). Power-ups are equally loony-tunes. There are hundreds of these goodies in the game, some passive, some active, and all are surreal, blasphemous, or an inventively sick combination of the two. Isaac can pick up the Stigmata power-up and start shooting more powerful bloody tears. The Black Bean causes Isaac to spew toxic fart clouds whenever he is attacked. A Placenta boosts health. The severed heads of various pets provide all kinds of buffs, as do Tarot cards, evil books, and so forth. Cancer gives you -- ah, I don\'t even know or want to know. It was enough for me to see Isaac shout, ""Yay, cancer!"" when he picked it up.', ""At first, it's hard to know what to think of all this. I alternated between nervous laughter and being sort of grossed out. Then the game took over, and suddenly the idea of whistling poop boss monsters didn't seem all that crazy. Beyond all the insanity, Rebirth is a fantastic arcade shooter. Combat speed, a variety of enemies, and alternating types of rooms keep you off-kilter just enough so that the game never gets repetitive. One moment, you're taking on blackened babies in a huge cavern, and the next, you're dealing with poisonous slugs in a cramped room loaded with obstacles."", ""Levels also hit you with optional challenges, like rooms that can only be opened with keys, dangerous rooms with toothy doors, shops where you can buy items, special rooms like an arcade where you can play games to try to earn items, and much more. You also have to make tough calls at times. Hmm, I'm down to just one heart. Do I take a chance on battling the end boss in that room up ahead right now? Or do I go back and explore some other chambers I skipped earlier and hope I can avoid enough damage to pick up some hearts? With the threat of permadeath always looming, you have to spend at least a little time thinking about the best ways to move forward."", ""The visuals are also disturbing in that they blend an innocent, pixelated design more fitting to a cheerful eight-bit console game than something this twisted. The look of the game makes you expect something kid-friendly and G-rated, to the point where I couldn't quite believe that these graphics were being used to show bloody trails behind a little kid and the exploded remains of evil babies. The audio is almost as catchy as the gameplay, with the most distinctive part of it being the 80s hair metal score that sounds like it was concocted during a collaboration between Cinderella and Iron Maiden."", 'Come for the brilliantly designed shooter action; stay for the poo. The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth may first catch your attention with its insane setting, surreal monsters, and irreverent references to Christianity, but the speedy, varied gameplay and seemingly neverending new features (which include multiple endings and new bosses after you take out mom the first time, so the replay value is nearly infinite) are what keep you coming back for more.

A quarter-century later, though, Rollers of the Realm has arrived on the scene with a similar blend. The fresh attempt would be exciting news indeed if only the results weren't so messy."", ""You can try your hand at two modes: a campaign and an arena. The former option is the star of the show, telling the story of a thieving young girl who doesn't have time to worry about ancient legends because she's too busy scrounging for coins. She arrives in a port and soon runs afoul of the local militia, which is in service to a wicked blacksmith who in turn serves an even less pleasant baron. Separated from her precious pooch, the sassy heroine takes up with a growing number of allies, and together the heroes fight to right various wrongs on their way to an epic showdown with evil."", 'In a sense, the characters from the story are all playable. This is a pinball game, after all, and the heroes are the balls. They all possess unique traits that you utilize as you knock them around a given table. For example, the gruff knight is larger than the others and can smash through obstacles more swiftly. A mystic woman restores health, a mysterious archer knocks rodents out of his path with projectile shots, a sorceress weaves powerful spells, and so forth. You meet new friends regularly as you advance through the campaign, and you can hire additional allies once you acquire enough gold.', ""Gold is in distressingly short supply, though, and the junk you can buy with it is underwhelming. A helmet might allow a ball to deal more damage when it collides with an adversary, or some boots might permit faster movement. This is a neat idea except that you mostly have to take the game's word for it; the impact that any single item has on a corresponding ball is difficult to spot even when you're looking for it. Since you must outfit each individual hero with increasingly costly accessories, efforts to improve your character mostly amount to busy work."", ""Another problem is that the core physics system doesn't feel right. Balls don't seem to have any proper weight to them, the way they do in typical pinball games like Zen Pinball. Instead, they fly around the screen like pigeons on caffeine, destroying obstacles or speeding toward openings along the bottom of the table in a manner that doesn't feel especially pinball-ish."", ""The tables are also bland, offering too little variety and too few secrets to be interesting. Many of them contain a hidden treasure, but all you generally have to do is light a few torches on the wall to reveal a key and then bounce the ball against the locked chest to raid its contents. When enemies appear, they wander about briefly before settling into a position that is likely to bounce the ball in a direction you won't like, but you can hit them a few times and then they disappear. Some foes throw up shields to nullify frontal attacks, but that's more annoying than anything. You can always come at them from behind, after all."", ""The above description might make Rollers of the Realm sound easy just by virtue of its simplicity, but that's not entirely true. Enemy units often can fire projectile shots at your paddles, slowly (or much more quickly in later stages) chipping away at them so that they are considerably less effective. You can sometimes restore those paddles by rolling a ball over a potion or by activating a character's heal ability, but that's only possible if you haven't lost said hero to a bad bounce. If your helpful mystic is gone and you don't have another medic in the wings, you'll have to wait until you can fill a mana meter (by smacking against objects positioned around the current table) and revive your favorite friend. Then you can swap her into the battle, provided that you're able to bring the active ball to a rest against one of the main paddles. Switching one ball for the next quickly gets tiresome even though it takes only a few seconds with a supported controller, and performing the task often enough to safely clear the later stages is downright tedious."", 'Gold is in distressingly short supply, and the junk you can buy with it is underwhelming.', ""The game also stumbles where production values are concerned, but not consistently. Character portraits feature unevenly drawn eyes and distorted features, which can't entirely be explained away even when you remember that they are elsewhere represented by pinballs. The voice actors for some characters--particularly the heroine and the knight--do a great job, while some others fall flat or come across as caricatures. The music is suitably stirring but never memorable, and sound effects are both generic and unlikely to remind you of any pinball table you may have ever heard."", ""The aforementioned arena mode might easily have offered some additional depth, but instead, it is content to revisit a few familiar tables once you advance far enough in the campaign. They're no more interesting the second time around than they were the first, unless you are especially anxious to show up any of your friends who may have posted a score to the leaderboards. Your secondary prize for playing in an arena is additional gold that you can then spend in the campaign, but you only get to keep a tiny portion of your earnings, which is just irritating."", ""One final problem is the possibility that you will be left high and dry right near the end of the campaign. Difficulty progression is uneven throughout the experience, but it's still not terribly difficult to advance to a late stage. You can easily backtrack to previously completed areas to gain the experience and gold that will allow you to recruit additional team members and outfit them with the best gear. If nothing else, doing so gives you a few extra chances at a tough table. However, you might be tempted to avoid the hassle until an unexpectedly challenging event or two suddenly comes along, at which point you no longer are allowed to retrace your steps."", ' ', ""Like Pinball Quest before it, Rollers of the Realm is good enough at what it does to prove that a pinball and RPG mashup has potential. This isn't the game to live up to that promise, however. Its flaws are too numerous, and its strengths seldom manage to work in concert. The end result is more disappointing than it is entertaining, which is a real pity if it means another 25-year delay before someone takes the next crack at doing the concept justice.""]"Justin Clark,24-Nov-14,Speakeasy Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/speakeasy-review/1900-6415973/,3,PS4,"['Speakeasy is a fighting game based on a cross-country underground fisticuffs tournament in the time of Prohibition, populated entirely by Al Hirschfeld caricatures of actual notable figures from the era, where the winner gets access to the last barrels of legitimate hooch in America to do with what they will.', ""I am so, so sorry that I had to tell you that. I'm sorry because that is the only accurate description that one can give to the game, and because the description probably put a beautiful picture in your head of a wild, cel-shaded fracas, scored by the likes of Jelly Roll Morton and George Gershwin, of super moves involving Tommy guns, of the typically meaningless fighting game timer counting down to government raids, of flapper girls milling about in backgrounds, of final bosses living in Great Gatsby opulence, and of being able to replay great matches in the style of silent pictures. I apologize because I am going to have to sweep all those wonderful ideas away and tell you what Speakeasy actually is: a glorified game of Rock, Paper, Scissors."", 'I apologize because Speakeasy is, quite simply, a waste.', ""The core of Speakeasy's gameplay is that you pick your character, each character stands on opposite sides of the stage, and upon the word Fight! you can either attack using X, block using Square, or fake out your opponent using Circle. Matches are one-hit kills, and in the main gameplay mode, you can only press each button once. If your attack connects, your opponent's head pops off and you win. If you both try to attack at the same time, there's an Injustice-style quick-time minigame when the fighters meet in the middle that determines the winner."", ""These mechanics might have found a reasonable home on mobile platforms, but having it be PS4 exclusive is like using an orbital laser to heat up a Hot Pocket. It's a game prime for bite-sized bursts of fun while waiting to do something else. There's the thin trappings of strategy here, where split-second timing to beat your opponent to the punch is key, and having the ability to fake out opponents is a nifty twist, though that's as far as the game's strategy really goes, and all it really does is raise the game, in fleeting moments, from being just Rock, Paper, Scissors to Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots."", ""There's no meat on Speakeasy's bones. There is no single-player mode and no online matchmaking, so unless you can find another person to play with, it's useless as even a fleeting diversion. There are a few different modes allowing you to press each button two or three times instead, a three-person tag mode, and options for tournaments, but this isn't the kind of game that lends itself to that level of obsession and competition, especially when actual Rock, Paper, Scissors is free, and you can probably reward each other with real-world snacks instead of a pathetic selection of fancy hats for your 100th win."", ""Speakeasy being just a simple, ignorable bad game could be accepted, but the fact that it had to drag a fantastic premise down with it is criminal. Every time the character selection screen pops up is a tragedy in motion: The cast of playable characters includes easily recognizable caricatures of Nicolas Tesla, Amelia Earhart, and Charlie Chaplin, but it also aims for appropriate historical deep cuts, like a stern, hatchet-wielding effigy of Carrie Nation. The cast is rounded out by a brickhouse giant, old-style mustachioed boxer and a black jazz trumpeter. It's a cast of characters that you never see in any fighting game, and the likelihood of it ever happening again is slim. Each character only has about five animations apiece, with no voice acting, each controls identically, and virtually none of the personality you'd assume from seeing these characters on sight is present. It's basically no different from when old-school gamers had to lay cellophane over TVs to pretend that the bounding lights on their screens were something else. It was silly in the 70s. Its unthinkable now."", ""Ultimately, everything about Speakeasy comes down to a leitmotif of ____ is too good for this game. The PS4 is more powerful than the game deserves. The premise is more than the game needs. The characters are too perfect just to be squandered on punching characters' heads off. The game was better when it was just Rock, Paper, Scissors. The price is more than the game is worth. And your time is better spent doing something else."", ' ']"Don Saas,24-Nov-14,WWE 2K15 Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wwe-2k15-review/1900-6415972/,5,Xbox One & PS4,"[""Wrestling is a pageant. It is a ritualized celebration of athletic excellence, over-the-top characters, and flashy production. Take away any of these elements, and the pageantry suffers. Phenomenal technical or aerial wrestlers like Cesaro or Kofi Kingston have trouble getting over with audiences because they don't have the bombastic personalities to match their enormous in-ring talent. And wrestlers that are all charisma and no technical skill burn out when their gimmick is no longer welcome. The current-gen releases of WWE 2K15 nail the production and athletics of wrestling better than any game in the franchise, but the character-driven, storytelling soul of the WWE is lost in the process."", ""After scrapping his way up from the WWE's developmental circuit, NXT, the Hollywood Thunder has fought every opponent thrown at him and spent an unprecedented year as the NXT champion as he honed his craft on second-tier programs like Main Event and Superstars. But, it's time. He's been called up to the big dance. He's on Smackdown. It's not quite Raw, but instead of fighting jobbers, Thunder is taking on established names. Now is his chance to prove he belongs in the WWE."", ""Sadly for the Hollywood Thunder, it turns out that being on Smackdown isn't too different from the years that preceded his promotion. Voluntarily dropping the NXT title so he can challenge for more prestigious belts, he winds up battling in months of filler matches with no story and no context. He's making more money, but he misses the days when each fight meant something... when each fight was a blood feud to keep his belt."", 'But, one day, apropos of nothing, Daniel Bryan calls him out. One of the most naturally talented superstars of the modern WWE hasn\'t lost a match in six months, and he appoints the rising Thunder his challenger. How does Thunder respond? He punches the leader of the ""Yes!"" movement in the family jewels. Thunder\'s a heel and for the next month, he spends every possible moment sneak-attacking Daniel Bryan in preparation for their big match. And when the PPV finally comes, Thunder knocks out the ref, bludgeons Daniel Bryan with chair shots, and then hits a Curb Stomp for the win. And, afterwards... Daniel Bryan and the Thunder lead the WWE Universe in a friendly ""Yes!"" chant to celebrate Thunder\'s victory.', ""That story evolved from time spent with WWE 2K15's highly touted MyCareer mode. And for those hoping for the tightly crafted narratives of WWE career modes of yesteryear: leave those expectations at the door. After creating a character (provided you don't experience the hard crashes currently plaguing Xbox One users in this mode), you begin as a fresh recruit at the WWE Performance Center in Florida and work your way up the WWE ranks until you can one day be the WWE champion."", ""And while the mode lays the groundwork for storytelling in the beginning (including fully-voiced cut scenes with actual NXT trainer Bill DeMott), it quickly devolves into an endless series of text-driven messaging. If you're lucky, Vickie Guerrero or William Regal will provide you with short snippets for why you should care about your match, but, more likely, your fight will lack any sort of context and you'll be wrestling purely for the money and upgrade points."", ""That story with Daniel Bryan occurred after over eight hours in MyCareer mode. And the four weeks spent feuding with the man who stole this year's WrestleMania were the highlight of the mode even if the ending makes no sense considering my custom character's role as a sneaky, vicious heel. Prior to that match, I'd had a couple of social media-driven feuds with over superstars but those only lasted a week or two and they only ever occurred when I was the NXT champ. And after the Bryan feud, it was hours of meaningless fights before another story event occurred. I joined Team Randy Orton (the heel team) for Survivor Series but, like the majority of previous feuds, this was told only through tweets."", 'With the exception of the short-lived Bryan feud, every element of MyCareer mode (one of the two story-driven modes in WWE 2K15) feels half-baked. You have a face/heel gauge, but opportunities to act as a heel or face are rare. I counted perhaps four moments in my 10 or so hours with MyCareer mode when I was able to make a heel story choice. Mostly, the only way I was able to generate heel heat without sacrificing my momentum as a superstar was to put on a great match and then hit my opponent with a foreign object to get myself disqualified. Upgrading your character is too slow a process at first and then goes far too quickly once you make it to Smackdown. I went from taking months to upgrade key stats to majorly updating multiple stats in weeks. Similarly, you spend your salary on new moves which also goes from torturously slow to overwhelmingly rapid at the flip of a switch.', ""The other, better campaign mode is the 2K Showcase focusing on two of the biggest rivalries in WWE history: John Cena vs. CM Punk and Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H. It's largely unchanged from the last-gen versions (MyCareer mode being a current-gen exclusive). You fight a series of matches exploring the most dramatic moments in these classic feuds while smart video packages provide context for your bouts. Though, any fight without a video package is immediately recognizable as the filler it is. The Shawn Michaels/Triple H feud, in particular, delivers a rousing arc of friendship, betrayal, and revenge from start to finish."", 'The 2K Showcase mode also displays a fantastic mechanical wrinkle where in-match objectives add a layer of unpredictability and drama. In the first match of the CM Punk/John Cena feud, you may have an objective to hit Cena with a top-rope signature. And you attempt this but transition to a cut scene where Cena counters with an Attitude Adjustment that you turn into the Go to Sleep which he then turns into the STF which you turn into an Anaconda Vise. Great wrestling matches are full of these shocking back and forth moments, and for those not familiar with the inner workings of all of these classic matches, it constantly keeps you wondering about what will happen next.', 'For those hoping that the gutted rosters and customization suites that blighted the last-gen versions would be gone for new systems--sorry. Although the last two years of WWE games have seen positively massive rosters and a treasure trove of ways to tweak your WWE experience, 2K15 features the current Raw/Smackdown rosters, a handful of NXT superstars, and a similarly limited selection of classic performers. And entire Create-A-""X"" modes have been removed from the game, including Create-A-Diva, Create-A-Storyline, Create-A-Finisher, and more. It\'s a disappointment for the most dedicated modders out there, and the WWE creative community is usually quite active.', ""It's a shame that the stories and personalities that keep audiences tuned into wrestling every week (whether that's Stone Cold flipping the bird to Mr. McMahon or, more recently, Rusev's anti-American rampage across the entire WWE roster) are so absent from MyCareer mode because the series has never looked better. New technology and a new console generation have led to night-and-day leaps forward in character capture. Stars like Dolph Ziggler, Randy Orton, Sami Zayn, and many more are stunning, with animations that even manage to capture some of their signature facial tics. I tweeted a still of Dolph Ziggler from the game, and at first a friend thought it was a screencap from television."", ""It is capable of delivering great in-ring action, and it has the flashy production values that none of Vince McMahon's competitors have ever been able to replicate, but it's hard to care about why any of it is happening beyond the moment-to-moment competition."", ""Not all of the character models are successes, though. Superstars with pronounced facial features become cartoonish with this new scanning technology. John Cena looks like a jowly, Cro-Magnon bulldog, and any characters with large foreheads seem comically misproportioned in the game. That's nothing compared to characters with large mouths, though, such as The Miz or Summer Rae who become almost monstrous with freaky, distended smiles. Theyd look more at home in a Silent Hill game. Characters that weren't scanned at all may lack the body horror of poorly scanned performers, but they're certainly less appealing than the scanned performers."", 'The in-ring combat has seen nearly as much improvement as the game\'s visuals. Though the new ""collar-and-elbow tie-up"" system for the beginning of matches adds an interesting strategic tweak that keeps matches from unrealistically exploding right out of the gate, it\'s the new stamina and health systems that totally revamped how I played WWE 2K15. For the last couple entries, stamina was relegated to when your character ran. It had little to no interaction with grappling and striking or aerial offense. And, while the health for each body part is still present, a character\'s health is primarily related to a health bar.', ""Each character has three stamina bars and three health bars. If you lose a health bar, you drop down to the equivalent stamina bar if you haven't fallen there already. This ensures that if you're at low health, your character is now beat to hell and worn completely out. He can't move as quickly as he did at the beginning of the match. It became my goal to make sure that my character's stamina never dropped below where his health dictated it should be. This slowed my play down significantly, but it made matches more realistic. I wasn't flying full-force at opponents until I squashed them into defeat. I had to think about how I expended my energy. And, if I made tactical errors, it was much easier for AI opponents to turn the table on me than it had been in years past."", ' ', ""Certain wrinkles of combat are still problematic. Counters still refuse to become an intuitive process minus countering strikes. It's too easy to lose all of your first bar of stamina (an important advantage in combat) if you're at the losing end of the rock-paper-scissors element of the collar-and-elbow tie-ups. Tag team partners don't seem to know anymore that, if you've hit your finisher on an opponent and are about to go for the pin, they should enter and stop your opponent's partner from breaking up the pin. And reversals do a disproportionate amount of damage that creates a disincentive to perform many moves in your arsenal."", ""Furthermore, though theyre much rarer than they were in the last-gen versions, bugs still pop up. In tag matches, it's easy to make your performer's hands vibrate infinitely at super speeds if you're not the one tagged in. During a training match in the performance center, a collar-and-elbow tie-up turned into both wrestlers falling on the ground, and then floating/sliding under the ropes and out of the ring without ever stopping. And, certain finishers just won't connect (not involving a legitimate counter) simply because the game's collision system decides it doesn't want to function."", ""WWE 2K15 reminds me too much of the modern WWE. It is capable of delivering great in-ring action, and it has the flashy production values that none of Vince McMahon's competitors have ever been able to replicate, but it's hard to care about why any of it is happening beyond the moment-to-moment competition. And while that can provide plenty of entertainment while you're playing/watching Raw, it leaves the sinking feeling that the wrestling you love lacks the spark to be special anymore. At no point does WWE 2K15 gel into something truly special.""]"Josiah Renaudin,20-Nov-14,Adventure Time: The Secret of the Nameless Kingdom Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/adventure-time-the-secret-of-the-nameless-kingdom-/1900-6415970/,6,PC,"[""Adventure Time: The Secret of the Nameless Kingdom is a Legend of Zelda clone, through and through. Its overhead perspective, sword-swinging combat, multi-floored dungeons, and item-based progression go beyond simply hinting at the game's roots; they beat you over the head with them. It's far from inventive, but being a clone doesn't necessarily sap a game of its merit. The Secret of the Nameless Kingdom is a well-executed replica of a formula that isn't seen all that often outside of Hyrule, and while a persistent lack of direction leads to frustrations, Adventure Time still stands above the heap of insipid licensed games so often rushed out the door."", ""It might not be as grandiose as A Link to the Past or The Minish Cap, but the Secret of the Nameless Kingdom provides a similarly satisfying experience on a smaller scale. Three temples are located at opposite ends of the overworld, each housing locked rooms, new items that let you progress to different locations, and a final boss that's more of a puzzle than a test of combat proficiency. You're often asked to make use of whatever fresh ability you come across-- whether it be a glove that lets you push heavy objects or a fire spell you shoot across the screen--eliminate your target and save a princess being held in captivity."", ""The combat is basic at best, but what makes these encounters so enjoyable is discovering your enemy's weak spot. Desperately swinging your sword at a boss's armored gullet is fruitless, so you instead play around with the environment, your enemy's patterns, and the equipment you have at hand to get the job done. The Zelda parallels go beyond the temples. Bushes can be chopped down for loot, treasure chests open to reveal keys and heart pieces, and your boomerang stuns creatures when it makes contact--everything you'd expect from a game of this nature is here. There's even a familiar camera scroll as you move from screen to screen, and somehow, that sense of familiarity is almost comforting. What could feel like a knockoff instead arrives as a breath of fresh air, and, of course, Adventure Time's wacky personality adds a touch of distinctiveness to the journey."", ""Finn and Jake are the stars, with popular characters from the TV show like the Ice King and Choose Goose acting as quest-givers. As you'd guess, nothing about these activities is traditional. In no other game are you asked to capture a fart in a plastic bag and release it to make a talking Cinnamon Bun laugh so hard he jumps off a bridge, but that's the norm here. It's absurd, yet this frivolity isn't as prevalent as what is seen in the series itself. The sense of silliness comes from the characters and the nature of your quests, but the often-weak dialogue prevents the humor from truly shining through."", ""The map is smaller than your average Zelda game, but an overall lack of direction means that you'll become well-acquainted with its every nook and cranny. There aren't big, glowing markers telling you where to go and how to get there; beyond the sparse NPCs who offer a helpful hint or two, it's up to you to find your way. I wasted a significant portion of my playtime within sections of the mountains and swamps that I'd explored dozens of times, aimlessly searching for a quest or character I'd somehow missed along the way. It's the structure of the overworld, not the temples themselves, that present the most exigent--if unintentional--puzzle, leading to unnecessary pacing problems."", ""That's not to say that individual temples don't provide a healthy challenge. Pushing blocks into the correct spot and flipping the right switch at the right time requires a true eye for detail, and the steady stream of enemies looking to end your journey doesnt make your job any easier. Each of the temples and their corresponding environments present their own unique aesthetic, too, so you won't feel like you're doing any rehashing once you actually find a way inside each structure."", ""It has the personality of Adventure Time, but the Secret of the Nameless Kingdom holds the heart and soul of The Legend of Zelda. For the most part, that's a good thing. The temples present creative challenges, and the bosses are fun to tests your wits against. Lulls in progression stemming from the game's failure to communicate objectives lengthen what should be a short and sweet adventure, but that doesn't sully the game's core. Even if the Secret of the Nameless Kingdom can bite at your nerves, it's fun and funny enough to keep you searching for the next boss key.""]"Jeremy Signor,20-Nov-14,Freedom Wars Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/freedom-wars-review/1900-6415969/,8,PlayStation Vita,"['Life isn\'t easy for a Sinner in Freedom Wars. You\'re dropped into a ruined, vaguely urban area, armed to the teeth with guns and technologically enhanced melee weaponry. As you begin to get a feel for your surroundings, you mow down a few stray drones with your submachine gun. To see what\'s ahead, you bust out your Thorn--a specialized piece of grappling equipment that also sports healing, defensive, and binding features--and propel yourself up to a crumbled balcony. That\'s when you see your target, a hulking, aggressive Abductor battle mech built to kidnap the smarter caste from enemy Panopticons (dystopian enclosures that serve as countries) and deliver them to work for their captors. Your job is to liberate these ""resources"" and get them back home.', 'You take a couple of pot shots from on high, then spring into action, catapulting yourself into the thick of the fight with your Thorn. This particular model is protected by shield generators on either shoulder, so you switch to your hi-tech short sword and use your Thorn to grapple onto one of them in order to cut away and eventually sever the generator while the rest of your team is keeping the mech occupied. Once the shields are down, you fling your Thorn at the mech once more, this time in an attempt to drag it down and immobilize it. Your teammates join in, making the task that much easier. When it finally falls, you all gang up on it, eventually destroying the central pod and exposing the Citizen encased inside. Once again using your Thorn, you leap up, grab the Citizen from a flaming, near-wrecked Abductor, and make a mad scramble for a specialized transport tube that will take him to safety as the Abductor frantically chases after you in order to reclaim its bounty.', ""That's the beauty of Freedom Wars in a nutshell. Equal parts Monster Hunter and Phantasy Star Online, Freedom Wars thrusts you into bite-sized maps with a team, a mission, and a plethora of ways to approach them, including assault rifles, chain guns, rocket launchers, swords, flamethrowers, and even guns that fire sticky webs at enemies to slow them down. Each weapon can be equally destructive in the right hands, but they all feel distinct, encouraging players to find their own play styles. Supplementing these weapons are a number of other battle items such as mines, grenades and decoys, letting you employ a number of inventive strategies."", ""But it's the Thorn that gives the player flexibility and allows the levels and missions to feel more alive and open than many Monster Hunter-type games. Freedom Wars doesn't have a class system per se, but the Thorn's powers go the furthest to define roles in combat, whether they be immobilizing Abductors, erecting barricades that you can shoot through but your opponents can't, or healing the party. The Thorn's base abilities give players a staggeringly large amount of versatility. The grappling element means there are levels in which verticality actually matters, and between dragging enemies down, clinging to them as you hack pieces off them, and using them as anchors to launch yourself elsewhere, the Thorn lends the game a feel not unlike the popular anime Attack On Titan."", ""This variety extends to the mission types as well. You'll often be rescuing Citizens from Abductors, but sometimes you're tasked with destroying the mechs completely, taking the protection angle out of the equation. Or you may be pitted against another team of Sinners, turning the proceedings into a traditional third-person shooter deathmatch. You'll also occasionally see Citizens thrown into the mix to make it more like a frenetic game of Capture the Flag, or terminals you must rush to control like a big King of the Hill match. Freedom Wars deftly repurposes shooter game modes as old as the genre itself with its cooperative conceit, creating an experience of play that is distinctly its own."", 'All this is complemented by the game\'s commitment to its theme. Your control prisoner is sentenced to a million years for being a worthless drain on society as you\'re forced into ""voluntary"" militarized missions to gather resources and engage enemy forces. Completing these missions reduces your sentence little by little and gives you points that can be used to buy entitlements to make your stay more habitable, though until then you\'ll also commit such crimes as pacing too much in your cell, sleeping while lying down, and daring to come within five feet of another Sinner. It stings a bit getting a hundred more years tacked onto your sentence for such stupid infractions, but you soon realize that\'s a pittance compared to what you earn from completing missions, making it a neat detail inexorably tied to the game\'s theme. Online play also continues this trend, pitting your home Panopticon (mine is New York) against every other one in the world. You can even invade enemy Panopticons, and though it\'s ultimately a small part of online play, it\'s yet another thematic tie-in that lets you buy into this world. Plus it\'s fun to have rivalries against top Panopticons. (Damn you, Hong Kong!)', 'The grappling element means there are levels in which verticality actually matters.', ""Sadly, the same can't be said for the games story, which does fill in the neat details of the world, but also merely attempts to string together your missions with a frail skeleton of anime tropes. Worse still is the narrative's insistence on interrupting your time with the game to constantly force you to wander around a static-feeling town and talk to plot points until the next mission appears. (This becomes much less annoying once you purchase the fast travel Entitlement.) And then there's the awkward forced stealth sections that don't allow you to use your Thorn or equipment. Though they're painfully easy, they're also painfully pointless and awkward to play through. It's a shame that a game as thematically rich as Freedom Wars has to be saddled with such an inept story."", ""And then you have a handful of little issues here and there that keep the game from being truly superb, such as the fiddly lock-on system that makes the camera go haywire if you're too close to a target. The game's crafting system also feels much more complicated and arbitrary than it needs to be. Over the course of the game, you accumulate an obscene amount of resources you can use to upgrade your weapons. The problem is that you'll usually stick to a handful of preferred weapons once you get a feel for the game, so you're either going to only care about a small number of the mountains of items you've acquired or none at all. And the crafting for battle items and medical supplies proves even more puzzling given that you can plug in any amount of any resource and get a pile of goods back, but what you get is randomized. A pared-down, simplified crafting system would have made the game that much better."", ""None of that matters, though, when you're flying around the battlefield toppling giants, making daring escapes with Citizens, chopping entire pieces off an Abductor, clinging to walls like Spider-Man, and climbing tall structures only to dive down and slice an unsuspecting Sinner with impossible force. Every action in the meat of the game just feels good, especially when you join up with three other people online to take down missions or even pit yourself against other teams. Once you get the hang of the complex controls and slight camera issues, you're in for a breathless, exhilarating time staring down giant robots, outmaneuvering your rivals, and rescuing your betters. You may be battling for your freedom, Sinner, but you may not want this battle to end once you get going.""]"Daniel Hindes,20-Nov-14,Never Alone Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/never-alone-review/1900-6415968/,4,PC,"[""Never Alone is a heartbreaking game, but not just because it's a particularly sad one. No, it's because the game's concept is admirable--a platformer steeped in the culture and folklore Native Alaskan Inupiaq people--but the game itself is shabby. Included in Never Alone are short video vignettes comprising interviews with Inupiaq elders, and beautiful footage of the real-world locations you visit; from these, it's clear that great respect was paid to Inupiaq cultural touchstones and their translation into game mechanics. These videos are unlocked as you progress through the game, and do an excellent job of giving a cultural context to the level you are about to play. Never Alone has a genuine and honest desire for you to learn about these people, their way of life, and their methods of storytelling--and by the end of the game, you walk away with an appreciation for all three, but you resent the journey required to get there."", ""You control a young girl who must set out into the Alaskan wilderness to find the source of a particularly powerful blizzard. Your standard sidescrolling platformer mechanics are present and accounted for: running, jumping, and pushing boxes to jump to higher ledges, and eventually you use a throwing weapon called a bola to break through ice that blocks your forward progress. This simplicity isn't what makes Never Alone a poor game, for even within this familiar framework, occasional bugs and unresponsive controls frequently result in deadly falls into crevasses or freezing water. Movement feels slow and unwieldy, and for a game in which you spend your entire time running across ice, this makes sense. But the game also throws you into chase sequences or platforming puzzles that require precise timing which the controls simply do not allow."", ""On top of this, the blizzard at the centre of the story plays a role in the mechanics as well. In some levels, strong gusts of icy wind blow across the screen at seemingly random intervals, requiring you to hold a button to brace against the ground and avoid being blown backward. The problem here is that it's incredibly difficult to discern when a gust is about to blow. You frequently find yourself halfway through a jump, only for the blizzard to suddenly blow you backward to your death. Eventually, you find a slightly more readable pattern to the timing of the gusts, but discovery generally occurs as the blizzard itself stops, only to start up again later in the same level. Sure, the weather evokes how harsh the Alaskan wilderness can be, but it does so in a frustrating way. Toward the end of the game, you need to use the blizzard to boost your jump length in ways that require precise timing. So you have a seemingly randomised mechanic that requires intentional use, but only through sluggish controls that require a precision they are not capable of providing."", 'Never Alone has a genuine and honest desire for you to learn about these people, their way of life, and their methods of storytelling', 'That lack of precision is most evident in the companion character, an arctic fox. A second player can take control of the fox and work in tandem with the young girl to solve slightly more complicated platforming puzzles. Some later puzzles are less fiddly to solve with two people, but the game is still fully playable in singleplayer mode; a button is used to toggle control between the girl and the fox. The problem here is that, when the other character is not being controlled, an AI takes over and attempts to keep up with the other character by doing its own running and jumping--and the AI often falls to its death, or gets stuck.', 'The frustration is compounded by the fact that the fox can activate ""spirit platforms"" that only exist when it is close to them; if the fox moves away, the platforms fade out of view and cause characters who were once standing on them to fall. If the fox\'s movement is left up to the AI, it will routinely move away from these platforms while you, as the young girl, were still in the middle of climbing them. In the latter half of the game, the fox gains the ability to move these platforms around by grabbing and pulling them, but there\'s barely any visual feedback communicating when a grab is successful, or when certain platforms cannot be moved despite being identical to the ones that can.', 'I began my time with Never Alone thinking that it could be the kind of game I would recommend even to people who rarely play games, something to hold up alongside the likes of Journey, inspiring me to say, ""Look! Here is what games can do!"" By the game\'s conclusion, the opposite was true; frequent and infrequent players alike should avoid it, for no amount of narrative sincerity makes up for this exercise in mechanical frustration.']"Miguel Concepcion,19-Nov-14,Escape Dead Island Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/escape-dead-island-review/1900-6415966/,5,PC & PS3,"[""There's a pervasive plainness to Escape Dead Island that hasnt been common since the PlayStation 2 days. This zombie joins the list of competent yet unremarkable third-person survival adventures like Extermination and Cold Fear, games with Resident Evil-branded chips on their shoulders. You might be initially curious to know what answers Escape Dead Island, as an expository side story to the original Dead Island, could offer that would shed light on the series' initial outbreak. But Dead Island's mysteries are likely not what compels you to keep up with the franchise."", ""To reinforce the perception of Escape Dead Islands story as a canonical spin-off, this action adventure game is viewed from the third person rather than the first person perspective used in the prior installments. Moreover, the art direction foregoes the detail and grit of the prior games in favor of a graphic-novel-in-action look, right down to the 1960s Batman-inspired onomatopoeias during combat. The motion-comic style of the cutscenes between chapters are one of the game's few strengths, which made me wonder if this tale would have been presented better as a full graphic novel, digital or otherwise."", 'This art style certainly doesn\'t do survivor and zombie slayer Cliff Calo any favors. His unkempt beard, permanently furrowed brow, and Ian Somerhalder eyes make him the leading contender for the cockiest-looking protagonist of 2014. After a few hours, he reveals himself to be a more likable hero, who spits off chuckle-inducing one-liners that would make Arnold Schwarzenegger blush. The best include, ""How you like them brains?"", ""Mind under matter,"" ""Get some sleep. You look dead tired,"" and ""Let me axe you a question.""', ""Propelled by the need to impress his dad, Cliff and his two journalist friends have taken to the seas--thanks to the boat Cliff stole from his dad--to investigate the rumors surrounding Banoi, the locale of the first Dead Island. Instead, they end up at Napapela, which is in the same archipelago, and is conveniently affected by the same outbreak as Banoi. Cliff's motivations do more than hint at daddy issues, which reach hamfisted levels with physical manifestations of emotional baggage by the second half of the story. Coupled with a series of dream sequences inspired by Groundhog Day, you're left wondering what is a hallucination and what is reality. When some of the chapters begin with him waking up from the same bed inside a shipping container, you wonder if any of this is real at all. These tricks of perception are further explored in the new-game-plus playthrough, where subtle changes to map progression and narrative pique your curiosity. Its enough to draw you in for another few hours, but not enough to warrant a second full playthrough."", ""Escape Dead Island's uninspired design extends to its inventory system. It's neither as deep as the expandable suitcases of Resident Evil 4 nor as sparse as I Am Alive. There's no submenu for items; weapons like the pistol or katana are simply accessible with a single button press. Gear-like ropes and grapple hooks function more like keys than inventory items, since they're only useful in very specific areas. Even the gas mask auto-equips if you step foot in a toxic area. And it wouldn't be a zombie game without a makeshift melee weapon. Cliff's best creation is a multi-bladed hatchet on a pole, which he makes without your help. The lack of crafting further underscores the shallowness of Escape Dead Island."", ""One of the genre's conundrums is not knowing how many items should be saved in anticipation of a major fight. If you play conservatively, you end up vanquishing the final boss in less than 10 seconds due to having more rocket launcher rounds and other explosives than they know what to do with. Escape Dead Island saves you the time and effort of pondering item conservation because it doesn't have items for you to hoard aside from ammo. Furthermore, you only have two guns, a pistol and a shotgun."", ""Gear-like ropes and grapple hooks function more like keys than inventory items, since they're only useful in very specific areas."", ""Overall, the mix of optional zombie encounters versus mandatory ones is an even split. The sensation of pulling off a quiet, effective, and gruesome kill captures the same satisfaction as a discrete takedown in other stealth-intensive games like The Last of Us and the Splinter Cell series. Even if you prefer confronting over fleeing from zombies, be prepared for the latter. It's not because some sections are particularly hard or overwhelming; there's just no practical incentive to thoroughly cleanse Napapela of the undead. These zombies drop no loot to redeem or spend in stores because no such economies exist, and you can't earn experience since there's no ability-based progression to worry about. It doesn't make Escape Dead Island wholly boring, just one-dimensional."", ""Escape Dead Island also suffers from poorly-placed checkpoints, the kind that force you to endure a real-time cutscene or conversation before you're allowed to jump back into the action. Even worse, any death and subsequent respawn might result in the game freezing. This occurred an average of once per chapter (out of 11 chapters) during my PlayStation 3 playthrough, while I encountered slightly fewer lock-ups on a PC."", ""Napapela is as deep as it is wide, and while the square shape of the map implies a wealth of exploratory possibilities, this island is the furthest thing from an open world. With rooms filled with toxic fumes and locked doors that only upgraded weapons can unlock, traveling through the island is a deceptively linear experience. You have little choice but to move toward your current waypoint and there is little to no motivation to deviate from your course. Aside from a lengthy chapter in which you're tasked with retrieving three access cards from the other side of the island, all other key cards are close to the locked door you're looking to open. There's no guesswork; even the zombies who have the key cards you're looking for are clearly highlighted. I was pleased that the waypoint indicators are easy to follow and continually update as you reach each respective point. In a game in which every hurried footstep counts in avoiding zombies, the optional convenience of these indicators (you need to hold down a button to see your waypoint) did not diminish my experience. Escape Dead Island's few saving graces are the shortcuts that become available later in the game. Much like opening a one-way door in Dark Souls, using newly acquired grappling hooks and other gear turns a 15-minute trek into a five minute stroll. You can tell this was inspired by the best Metroid and Castlevania games, but the application of these influences feels lazy and trite."", ""The only reason you might want to go off the beaten path would be to hunt for collectables, and even those items offer scant insight on the cause of the infection. In the interest of a thorough investigation, Cliff's colleague in crime, Linda, asks him to take photos of newsworthy locales and objects, but since obtaining a complete collection of photos doesn't yield anything worthwhile, this side mission carries little value."", ""As an origin tale, Escape Dead Island is hampered by an issue common to the zombie genre: the appeal of the narrative focusing on the characters' day-to-day survival, combined with little attention being given to finding a remedy to stop the outbreak. When I finished Dead Island three years ago, I wasn't compelled to scour forums to theorize the root causes of the infection. There was enough exposition by game's end and whatever mysteries were left unsolved left me feeling indifferent. Despite my profound apathy regarding making sense of Cliff's hallucinations and dreams, there was at least some satisfaction in silently assassinating the undead.""]"Brett Todd,18-Nov-14,Space Hulk Ascension Edition Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/space-hulk-ascension-edition-review/1900-6415967/,7,PC,"['Space Hulk: Ascension gets it right. Developer Full Control Studios dropped the storm bolter last year in its first shot at adapting this Games Workshop board game classic, sticking too closely to the formula of the 1989 original. The designers have loosened their collars this time around. While they respect the intense Space Marine-versus-Alien duel at the heart of the original experience, more of the Warhammer 40,000 universe has been tossed into the mix, along with many new features that bridge the gap between the old board game and contemporary turn-based strategy gaming. There are still some lingering issues with the insanely punishing difficulty, and some quirks with the visuals and the interface. But this is still a much improved take on Space Hulk that, oddly enough, feels truer to the original game even as it moves farther away from it.', ""Subtlety is the shared characteristic of the changes and additions. Space Hulk: Ascension doesn't mess with the core elements of what made the tabletop game a cult hit. You take charge of squads of Space Marine Terminators, hulking genetic monstrosities in power armor that lead the way in the battle against aliens and heretics in the grim Warhammer 40,000 future, where there is only war and the laughter of thirsting gods. You get a thin slice of the brutality on offer in the greater world of Warhammer 40K miniature wargaming and fiction, guiding small groups of these fanatical warriors as they invade space hulks, which are wandering starships filled with alien Tyranid Genestealers that pose a threat to the Imperium of Man. There is a lot of backstory here, but all you need to know is that you must shoot, smash, and burn alien monsters that infest the shadowy corridors of spaceships."", ' ', 'Everything is handled with a traditional turn-based interface. Your Space Marines consume action points with every action, from firing storm bolter pistols and flamers, to going into overwatch to guard against enemy movement, to simply turning around in their big suits of power armor. Matches are slow, in that you have to constantly watch your flanks, guard enemy spawn points, keep an eye on ventilation ducts where Genestealers lurk, and so forth. All missions take place in the cramped confines of space hulks, ancient wrecks loaded with corridors so narrow that Space Marines have to proceed through them in single-file formation. Genestealers turn into blurs of teeth and claws up close, so positioning is vital unless you want to be turned into hamburger.', ""This sounds a lot like last year's Space Hulk. But once you get beyond these basics, Space Hulk: Ascension becomes a significantly different and better game. For starters, the game now features three Space Marine chapters, with the famous Ultramarines and Space Wolves joining the Blood Angels from the original game (the Space Wolves were also available as DLC for the first game). Both bring added Warhammer 40K atmosphere, along with some variations in gameplay, as the Ultramarines specialize in ranged combat and the Space Wolves in melee, while the Blood Angels are jacks-of-all-trades. The differences involve just a couple of unique weapons and a minimal difference in attacks, but the armor of each chapter is distinctive, giving matches a different flavor that is already a huge bonus to anyone who has been painting miniatures of these guys for years."", ""Space Hulk: Ascension doesn't mess with the core elements of what made the tabletop game a cult hit."", 'There are also three full campaigns (expect to play each for at least five or six hours), each with storylines tailored to the Space Marine chapters. (Unfortunately, multiplayer has been removed.) With the Ultramarines, you defend their homeworld of Macragge, while the Space Wolves deal with the fate of a long-lost pack, and the Blood Angels get the chance to redeem themselves yet again. There isn\'t a great deal of story here, with no voice-overs or cutscenes to set the scene and tell the tale. But the campaigns do feature branched missions where one assignment rolls into another, which provides some illusion that you\'re waging an ongoing war to destroy a space hulk instead of taking on barely connected battles. You are also given some choice when it comes to accepting missions, and are hit with optional one-off jobs taking on hordes of Genestealers. These events serve to extend the campaigns, although they also provide a changed focus in that they set up tactical free-for-alls instead of the goal-oriented (steal information, ""cleanse"" a corrupted Space Marine brother, set explosives, etc.) story missions.', 'Missions see you facing new and varied types of Genestealers now, with different types of armor and claws, feeder tendrils that allow brains to be gobbled up handily, and flesh hooks that can yank a marine in close for some tender loving crushing. Marines come in different varieties, too, with sergeants, melee and range specialists, heavy troops with flamers and cannons, and psychic librarians all joining the fray. Attack options that allow for aimed shots, suppression fire, and so forth have also been added, and up the ante during tactical combat.', 'Space Marines now also gain experience and level up. You can gain points that are applied to attributes such as ballistic skill, agility, and perception. New levels unlock access to weapons like the power sword, thunder hammer, and lightning claws, equipment and skill slots, and specialized skills that boost everything from your shooting accuracy to weapon heat management to overwatch ability. This system should be familiar to anyone who has played a turn-based squad game on the PC over the past two decades. Still, these frills nicely expand the core Space Hulk gameplay, giving you more strategic options when building your army while simultaneously helping you form a bond with troops that become better with each passing mission.', ""Or so the theory goes, anyhow. The blessing and the curse of Space Hulk: Ascension is that you have very little margin for error due to your small five-man squads, limited ammo, the proliferation of Genestealer spawn points, and other factors. Having the deck so stacked against you makes the game very exciting and tense, but also a bit maddening as losses are generally high, even on the missions where you emerge victorious. This has a real impact on character progression, as you of course have to keep your people alive for a mission or three for this feature to really matter. The lone redeeming feature is saving, as you can save progress in mid-mission and replay whenever you lose one of your top marines. Still, it's hard to keep up with casualties. Trying to be perfect, or even close to it, requires so many continual reloads that single missions can easily turn into multi-hour marathons."", ""The overall look and feel of the game has been much improved over its predecessor. Audiovisual quality has been boosted with improved Space Marine models, sharper and spookier-looking space hulk corridors, and a moody musical score. Problems that plagued the last game, such as unskippable animations, have also been removed. The one sore point, however, is that the game is now a little too dark. Where the first game was bright and colorful, like the tiles and painted miniatures of the board game, this second take adds in the fog of war and removes the top-down strategic map. Even in revealed areas, maps are now so shadowy and murky that it can be hard to identify doors, ventilation shafts, Genestealer spawn points, and even game icons like the green eye indicating that a marine is in overwatch. This adds to the atmosphere and tension, as you now don't know what awaits you. But it also increases the frustration factor and forces you to play with the camera and gamma settings."", 'Having the deck so stacked against you makes the game very exciting and tense, but also a bit maddening as losses are generally high.', 'The interface has also been overhauled with a radial menu for available orders that pops up whenever you click on a marine. It works very well for the most part--although the selections are quite small--in providing quick access to all Space Marine attributes. But there is no undo button, which was readily available in the last game. A ghost image of your marine in its new position is now shown before you click again to confirm moves, but it is way too easy to move the cursor a tiny bit and wind up facing the wrong direction. Or to move accidentally when you try to click on another marine and miss. Since action points are so few and so valuable, any slip-up like this can kill a Space Marine (use an extra point by mistake and you might not be able to go into overwatch, for instance). Adding back the undo button would be a huge benefit.', 'Space Hulk: Ascension rises to the challenge by preserving the spirit and most of the mechanics of the original board game, while still expanding on the design to embrace its new home on the PC. Even with the design miscues, this is the closest that board game fans have come to being able to recreate the heart of the tabletop experience on a computer or console since the two great Electronic Arts takes on the franchise that came out in the early 1990s. Unless you have a desire to play head-to-head or to paint miniatures, you can get all the Space Hulk that you need right here.', ' ']"Cameron Woolsey,18-Nov-14,LEGO Batman 3: Beyond Gotham Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/lego-batman-3-beyond-gotham-review/1900-6415962/,7,Xbox One & PS4,"[""Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham is as much a game about Batman as it is not. In fact, it's about as close as developer Traveller's Tales has come to producing a full-on Lego Justice League video game. In Beyond Gotham, Batman and Robin team up with the Justice League and the Lantern Corps to prevent Brainiac from using the power of the seven Lanterns to shrink Earth and add it to his growing collection of tiny space objects."", ""But the story has trouble deciding where to aim its spotlight. There are many scenes in which the caped crusader is his natural self as the man with the plan, and yet it's undeniably strange to occasionally watch him play the role of a grumpy, cynical supporting character--especially in his own game, which also celebrates his illustrious past. The confused package is further weighed down by some technical and mechanical issues, but remains standing thanks to the Lego series' endearing foundation of infectious charm and good-natured humor."", ""Gameplay in Lego Batman 3 doesn't stray far from the classic Lego design. Puzzles, which mostly involve opening doors or creating some other method of progress, are solved by breaking apart Lego objects and using the scattered pieces to create something new. The bilateral system of destruction and creation is just as enjoyable as ever, and collecting those precious studs is just as satisfying. As an old Lego fan, watching those plastic bricks fly through the air, skimming by just close enough for you to make out the LEGO name stamped on the tiny pieces, caused my heart to flutter with nostalgic delight. A wide variety of suits play a large part in exploration and puzzle solving, which includes wading through toxic sludge to knock down a ladder, or using an electricity suit to power doors."", ""Not all is perfect in this brick-laden superhero adventure. While most puzzles rarely put up much of a fight, there are several that offer no clear direction on how to proceed. It's not a question of insight; no, rather you are left cycling through characters and suits until you find the right peg for the predetermined hole, which quickly gets frustrating. It also doesn't help that your computer-controlled partners are comically dumb. When your allies aren't completely ignoring enemies, or just meekly punching away without causing much damage, you will often find them stuck on platforms or in a cluster of rocks. Another source of annoyance comes from iffy button prompts, which require you to be in an exact position to activate; otherwise you are forced to circle back and try again. Invisible walls surrounding levels drain the joy that comes with flying characters, even as the game encourages you to explore, with hidden secrets often found just out of sight."", 'Without question, Lego Batman 3 is a big party, and nearly everyone got an invite. Many of the Justice League big shots, such as the Martian Manhunter and the Flash, are here in full form. But I was also pleased to see the game give a fair shake to characters such as Plastic Man and the Atom, who both play an equal role in discovering hidden content. The game more than doubles the character count of its predecessor, bringing in about 150 playable characters to unlock. This includes various Batman iterations throughout his past, such as his hulking form modeled on his look in The Dark Knight Returns, and also the gray and blue leotard of his 1966 television debut. Excellent vocal work, provided by such seasoned veterans as Troy Baker (Batman) and Clancy Brown (Lex Luthor), breathes life into every character, fleshing out their distinctive personalities.', ""Crashing this party is a peculiar selection of celebrity guests, one of whom you'll find swiftly overstays his welcome. This is none other than Conan O'Brien, who acts as a dedicated tour guide in the Batcave and Watchtower, both of which exist as enormous hubs where you can select missions or look at collected trophies. You'll find him throughout the hubs explaining the function of particular rooms. The problem, though, is that O'Brien repeats his spiel every time you enter one of these areas. After listening to him explain for the umpteenth time what a map room is, I was ready to pull my hair out. Superhero fan and occasional Batman comic writer Kevin Smith also makes an appearance, but has thankfully fewer lines than OBrien. Adam West's inclusion makes the most sense out of the bunch, and you will find him in just about every level playing the role of a TV personality in distress. Though his audio level is through the roof and his pleas for help easily drown out everything else."", ""Lego Batman 3 is a massive game featuring tons of extra content, but not all of it is worth exploring. The lengthy campaign comes in at around 12 hours, but your time may differ depending on how many side quests you choose to pursue. The game is brimming with secrets and hidden collectibles, so much so that it can be overwhelming. Even after putting in around 20 hours completing the story and hunting down gold bricks and completing some extra missions, Id still barely scratched the surface. In addition, you also have miniature versions of the home worlds of Lantern Corps members. While it is initially rather neat to fly around the small planets, they don't offer much beyond even more items to collect and dull races to complete. All in all, theyre not much more than boring distractions."", ""Not unlike Batman's frequent adversary Two-Face, Lego Batman 3 has two conflicting sides at odds with each other. On one side, you have an entertaining superhero game in which Batman struggles to play the leading role. But on the other side, you have a respectful and satisfying look into Batman's storied history. Here, there are numerous nods and homages to famous works such as the Tim Burton films, Batman: The Animated Series, and of course books like The Dark Knight Returns and Batman: In Darkest Knight, among many others. The resulting game is somewhat perplexing, often verging on baffling. To be fair, this is not nearly enough to greatly harm what is overall a genuinely fun game, but it does mean that it lacks some sense of direction and balance."", 'Still, Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham is an engaging and often hilarious joyride. The game includes many standout moments, such as the Resogun-inspired shooter sections, as well as levels where you stomp through shrunken versions of famous cities. Many of the headlining characters are superb, with the Flash coming in as an easy favorite. His constant hijinks during cutscenes left me laughing out loud every time. Just as great is the portrayal of Cyborg, who left a broad smile on my face every time he unleashed his trademark ""BOOYAH!"" In short, the game is a delightful, family-friendly hop around the galaxy starring some your favorite superheroes. A wealth of hidden secrets in every level keeps the game high on replayability, while the deluge of extra content promises many hours of adventuring.']"Peter Brown,18-Nov-14,Pokemon Alpha Sapphire/Omega Ruby Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/pokemon-omega-ruby-alpha-sapphire-review/1900-6415965/,8,3DS,"[""The race to catch them all has been going on for nearly 20 years, and for better or worse, the heart and soul of the Pokemon series persists in the new 3D remakes of the two Game Boy Advance classics, Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire. From the modern presentation to the new mega evolutions and side content, Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire are greater than their progenitors, but they're still very similar to every Pokemon game that's come before. I'm OK with that, because at the end of the day, these are enjoyable games with a large number of cute combatants to capture and train, and near-infinite competitive multiplayer potential. As you delve into the world of battling other trainers, losses and close calls motivate you to search for more viable Pokemon and master the art of raising a strong and versatile team. Yes, there are some minor elements that need fixing, but it's all about hunting, training, and battling Pokemon, and those elements are as strong and engaging as ever."", ""As is usual, you're a plucky youth in a world where man and nature share an unyielding bond, and you're on a quest to catch and raise wild Pokemon in order to become the best trainer in the land. Along the way, you challenge top trainers from different gyms around the region, but you also go toe to toe with amateur trainers on the lookout for wild Pokemon. Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire live and die by their combat system, and though it may look simple on the surface, there's plenty of depth to explore if you take it seriously. If you only tackle the main storyline, you find a pleasant and easy role-playing game rife with cute, imaginative creatures, but delve into the realm of Pokemon mastery, and you discover a highly competitive world that rewards dedicated and sharp minds. Just don't expect much from the game's bone-dry plot which, apart from the message of man and nature living in harmony, offers little to the imagination or soul."", ""As you traipse around the island region of Hoenne, every patch of grass, body of water, and murky cave is ripe with combat possibilities against wild Pokemon. Tackling these encounters is how you earn experience and raise your team's abilities, and thanks to the exp share item that you acquire early on, your entire team benefits from combat even if only a single Pokemon engages in the fight. With exp share active, It's common for one of your six active Pokemon to level up or learn a new move after every fight, which is both rewarding and motivating."", ""Of course, wild Pokemon are yours for the catching if you manage to employ the proper tactics. It takes the right amount of finesse to whittle a Pokemon's health down to its last reserves, weakening it just the right amount to capture it in a Pokeball. It's disappointing when you accidentally go to far and drain all of their health, or they manage to escape from Pokeball after Pokeball, but when you finally land the elusive Pokemon you've been searching for, you revel in the feeling of accomplishment and the addition of a new ally. Some species appear more frequently than others, so you need persistence and patience if you hope to find, let alone bag, the pick of the litter. Given that there are hundreds of Pokemon in the game, and variations in skillsets among a single variety of Pokemon, it's somewhat demotivating when you continuously run into the same breeds for hours on end. Thankfully, this trend reverses around the game's halfway point."", ""One of the joys of these games is stumbling into unexpected and wildly creative Pokemon. Yes, there are simple looking creatures that resemble real-world counterparts, such as a frog or a wolf. However, as the game progresses, you meet something like Camerupt, which is a mix of a cow and a volcano, or Probopass, which is something akin to an Easter Island statue with a mustache and birds for arms. There are plenty of Pokemon that are absurd and make almost no sense, but they're part of what's so interesting about getting your hands dirty and digging into the wide world of catchable creatures. Catching Pokemon is always a challenge, and discovering surprising new forms is always intriguing."", ""Eventually, you're given access to mega Pokemon evolutions: temporary, super-powered forms of Pokemon that only exist during battle. Introduced in Pokemon X and Y, mega evolutions are an addition that makes the main quest slightly easier during the later stages, but it adds another layer to competitive play as you need to look for mega stones in the world if you want a full stash of mega-capable Pokemon."", ""Take one look at the combat system, and you may mistake it as rudimentary. With just a few exceptions during the course of the game, two Pokemon face off at a time with only four moves at their disposal; what could be so interesting? Give it a closer look, and you find that there's a deep system of elemental relationships and statistics lying underneath that adds a compelling amount of depth to what looks like a simple affair. Being good at combat is easy, but mastering it takes a significant amount of memorization and experience with different types of Pokemon. Though the story missions are mostly forgiving when it comes to your chosen warriors, especially once you get a hold of a few mega stones, it's real world opponents that have the best chance of giving you a challenge, and preparing for these scenarios requires dozens of hours of training beyond the plot's conclusion."", ""As arduous as hunting and training can be, the former is easier than ever in Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire thanks to the availability of the DexNav, a tool that reveals details of nearby Pokemon in the wild. This radar-like device gives you an idea of what to expect from hidden Pokemon, in terms of elemental affinity and level, and this data affords you a chance to temper your excitement or realign your team before getting into battle. It's a great little tool, and it's a prime example of how the series is evolving for the better, ever so slightly, by arming you with more information than in the past."", 'As in Pokemon X and Y, not all training takes place on the battlefield. Through a system known as super training, your Pokemon can hit a variety of punching bags to raise individual stats, or enter an arena and attempt to take down large inflatable Pokemon. Neither minigame is particularly fun, but if you want to get the most out of your Pokemon, super training handy tool to have at your disposal when aiming to raise a specific attribute.', ""Once you're confident enough in your team, you can battle opponents locally or online, and this is where the true endgame arises. It's not unheard of for people to spend upward of a hundred hours or more training their teams and perfecting their loadouts. As ever, Pokemon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire feature hundreds of Pokemon and different abilities to use in battle, making the possibilities for match-ups near endless. Trading Pokemon is also useful when you're looking for a specific type of Pokemon that may be exclusive to the opposing version of the game, and some Pokemon will only evolve into advanced forms when they're transferred from one player to another, making it an integral and necessary part of trying to catch them all."", ""There are other distractions to tinker with, including a series of beauty-pageant-like Pokemon contests that award the winner with honorary badges. You pit a Pokemon of your choosing against three others in front of a panel of judges that weigh merits such as coolness and toughness. The reward for pleasing the judges, the qualifications of which are difficult to decipher, is a ribbon that the victorious Pokemon gets to wear in perpetuity. Given that ribbons don't add any practical benefit to your Pokemon, coupled with the fact that it's difficult to understand exactly how the judging is done, you don't find yourself tempted to dedicate much if any time to Pokemon contests. Besides, you're too busy having fun hunting and raising Pokemon to be distracted."", ""Becoming a Pokemon master is a long journey that is at times exciting, and unexpected discoveries and the potential for hard-fought battles with friends compels you to charge forward. Yes, its the same game we've seen before, but that's not a bad thing when the core concept is so engaging and rewarding. Your dedication to the cause makes the difference between becoming a good trainer or the best trainer, and while some people may end their journey once the story concludes, there's a wide variety of Pokemon to capture and raise, and potentially thousands of opponents waiting to put your Pokemon skills to the test. Give these remakes enough time, and you begin to understand why Pokemon's formula hasn't changed much over the years. It's a seemingly simple and cute journey, but with the underlying potential for strategy in combat, and a massive number of adorable Pokemon to catch, you can't help getting hooked by Pokemon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire.""]"Alexa Ray Corriea,17-Nov-14,LittleBigPlanet 3 Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/little-big-planet-3-review/1900-6415964/,7,PS4,"[""It's not often that I can forgive a game for throwing me through the geometry to my doom simply because the game itself is just too damn delightful.

Little Big Planet 3 made me feel like I was never quite good enough to solve the next puzzle... until I was, thanks to a brand new tool dumped in my lap.

Newton opines that Bunkum needs more creative juice and unlooses three ancient Titans, monstrous inspiration-sucking beasts subdued in the past by three great heroes. After the Titans possess Newton and corrupt his intentions, Sackboy finds and recruits the aforementioned heroes: Oddsock, Toggle, and Swoop. Together, the fluff-stuffed quartet must rescue Newton and defeat the Titans.', ""Little Big Planet 3s campaign is divided into four main stages or hubs, one for the prologue and one for each new hero the game introduces.

To unlock each character, you need to collect special items and place them in a special shrine. I was at first wary of this over-cliched fairytale story, but the charm that has come to characterize Little Big Planet makes it palatable. Tarnished marbles are magic artifacts. A side-scrolling mess of grating and rotating platforms made me feel like I was in a paper-and-glue version of Raiders of the Lost Ark. Sackboy must complete the three main levels within each hub to collect magic marbles that awaken the heroes. These levels are scattered, tucked in corners of cardboard and scrap metal. Spreading them far apart encourages you to forgo beelining between them and take exploration time, uncovering secret challenges yielding rare materials and stickers."", 'Little Big Planets new characters are, predictably, endearing and adorable. The dog-like Oddsock is a fast runner that climbs walls and wall-jumps. Toggle can switch between tall and tiny versions, helping him manipulate gravity in water and on bounce pads for higher jump. Swoop flies and can carry objects through the air.', 'These new heroes can eventually be used within levels, but only within the hub world in which they are unlocked. Im disappointed that levels limit what character you can use, and most of the time its Sackboy. In fact, most of the game must be played as Sackboy, with no option to choose another character. Boss levels, too, can only be completed as a designated character and all players must be the same one. The hub stage itself can be explored as Sackboy or whatever new character it unlocks, leaving out the other two, and there is only one designated spot that allows swapping of characters. You can, however, participate as more than one character in creation mode, but that doesnt make the campaigns limitations less saddening.', 'There are still two-player missions scattered throughout levels and any can be played with friends locally or online, but there are only a tiny number of missions for all four characters to participate. Any level can be completed with one to four players, but all players must be the same hero. Oddsock, Toggle and Swoop are feebly underutilized, which is dispiriting considering they are some of the games high points.', ""Not only is it refreshing to play as someone other than Sackboy when you get the chance, but each character has a different feel to their gameplay. Toggle plods along but rockets through the air and skims across water when he switches between sizes. The physics changes drastically from the slower, more calculated way he must be played to handling Oddsock, who gallops through scenarios requiring sweat-inducing precision leaps. Swoop lets you fly without falling, and while his controls feel a bit too sensitive for an airborne companion, it offers a different way to complete a challenge. It's unfortunate that Little Big Planet 3 offers three new, drastically different gameplay experiences and restricts how and when players can enjoy them."", 'One of the best new additions is a handful of gadgets granting Sackboy greater freedom of movement and navigation to harder-to-reach spaces. A hairdryer-like item pushes or pulls objects with air, a flashlight illuminates hidden objects, and the Blink Ball shoots spheres into special panels that teleport you to other ledges. The Hook Hat lets you slide along rails and the Boost Boots give an extra airborne double-jump, making wide chasms less of an issue. These items grant more freedom of movement and make Sackboy actually feel powerful and smart. They make problems feel more open-ended and problem-solving more expansive. You can use these items freely at any time and most levels include hidden treats for those who go back to explore with these items.', 'With each new item, levels become more difficult. In fact, Little Big Planet 3 can be called the most challenging title in the franchise. Many sequences require nimble fingers, such as speedruns with Oddsock or carefully-timed jumps through teleporters that necessitate hair-trigger reactions. The game forces you to pay attention and learn through trial and error, dangling unlocked characters and new experiences in front of you. The learning curve is proportional to how quickly these new things are mastered. And its worth it: guiding Toggle through a complicated puzzle or flying Swoop through an anxiety-inducing maze of electricity is a satisfying payoff.', ""The physics in Little Big Planet have been notoriously floaty from the get-go and have gotten slightly more delicate in Little Big Planet 3. Learning to time jumps and getting the hang of switching directions in mid-air take time, but once you've mastered controlling the Sackfriends, trickier puzzles no longer seem insurmountable."", ""While solo play is great for score chasing, bringing a friend or three along can help you reach special multiplayer areas and goodies. I liked playing alone when I wanted to master a level, but it's better together with friends. I ran through a four-character level in which the player controlling Swoop kept picking us up and dropping us from dizzying heights. I played Popit Puzzles with a friend online, spending quality time with someone I rarely see building something amazing together. Little Big Planet 3 is a great distraction for one, but a heartwarming distraction for two, three and four. You'll want to bribe your friends over for this one."", 'New bits aside, Little Big Planet 3 masterfully builds upon its already well-established world. Beneath a snow-blanketed town is a tunnel of giftboxes, wrapped in sheet music and guarded by dancing Russian dolls. Inside a dilapidated diner floating in a swamp of aquamarine goo, I found myself inside a pinball machine talking to a movie star with a tin can body and hair made of photo negatives. The world is beautifully put together and intimately detailed, down to the feathers on a queens robe and the flashing neon signs embedded into the background.', 'Sprinkled throughout this beautiful world are NPCs that offer minigames and side quests. These characters--all fully voiced, for the first time in the series-assign tasks allowing weightier interaction with Bunkum. Minigames like tricking drones to shoot enemies in a paper-cloud sky and building go-karts from stickers are cherries on the LBP3 sundae. These challenges offer up some pretty great rewards, including new materials, stickers and in one case a Pug costume for Oddsock. Every empty space needing a sticker, every side character, adds a little more depth to an already oceanic world.', 'Like its predecessors Little Big Planet 3 features a level creator, but this time around that desire to inspire creativity is taken to new heights with an arsenal of tools that is overwhelming. You can make individual levels or entire maps, customizing spaces with everything from music triggers to poisonous gas and goo to obstacles requiring gadgets.', ""I have never been interested in (or very good at) level creation, because I'm horrible at interior decoration and could never make my bizarre Lego creations stand for long. I'm intrigued by staircases to nowhere and seemingly hopeless obstacles that require an entire bag of tricks to solve--neither of which I am very good at building, either. I'm not construction-minded and find more enjoyment in playing levels made by other people. But I was most enamored with Popit Puzzles, stages designed to instruct usage of each creation tool. Its a genius, sneaky way to trick you into using the level editor."", 'Popit Puzzles take up an entire planet by themselves and feature a very eccentric NPC professor. The professor walks you through each construction tactic, including how to edit corners, rotate and delete objects, and even where and how to place treacherous traps. Each Popit Puzzle plays like a traditional Little Big Planet level and introduces one tool. As players learn how to use the tool, the game throws in more obstacles that can only be solved using that one tool. Some puzzles require more brain power than other, with the answer not so readily apparent.', ""The Popit Puzzles don't baby you, but they make sure you can use tools effectively. Little Big Planet 3 solves the problem of making creation tools accessible to newbie-creators by weaving tiny tricks like placing electrified blocks and deleting objects into mini-levels that reward you. Its brilliant."", ""Little Big Planet 3 has a lot going for it--including another magnificently crafted soundtrack--but is plagued by crippling bugs. I repeatedly fell through set pieces or failed to respawn, and twice respawned into a side-scrolling level behind a boss and had to restart, losing all progress. These bugs hindered progression and made playing through levels requiring more precision a nightmare. They were present at various points throughout my entire playthrough, and while they weren't occurring every other level, they were common enough that I was annoyed."", 'Little Big Planet 3 is the most difficult game in the series by virtue of its challenges. More complicated problems mean more tools to solve them, giving you a wide berth to choose your own path through Bunkum. The push for creativity is limited in the way you play the campaign, but its an overwhelming presence within creation mode, offering boundless ways to leave your own mark on Craftworld.']"Justin Clark,17-Nov-14,This War of Mine Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/this-war-of-mine-review/1900-6415963/,8,PC,"['An hour into This War of Mine, I keep thinking about that bit in The Last of Us where someone was somehow clear-headed enough in the middle of a war zone to scrawl ""What happens when the food runs out?"" on a concrete wall on a backed-up highway. It\'s a meaningless bit of background detail there. Here, its an all-consuming, panic attack-inducing source of primal fear.', ""It's not a question a game about war ever asks, and when it shows the answer, it's never in as much emotional detail as its shown here. Even in a game like Spec Ops: The Line, which aims to measure the toll on the people fighting a war for too long, it's not a question you need to address, because there's only one way you can ever interact with the people in front of your gun. When the soldiers are miles away, when the smoke clears, and every home harbors the ghosts of innocent bystanders, how long do you have before basic humanity is nothing but background noise compared to the constant roar of a hungry belly?"", ""My own answer to that question came about 12 days into This War of Mine. All legitimate avenues for obtaining foodstuffs--through barter, scavenging bombed-out ruins, trapping animals--had been exhausted. Our only weapons are a crowbar and a knife, which I left with the person whom I told to stand guard overnight at home. The only option that didn't involve surely taking a bullet involved entering a relatively untouched suburb. There was no security, but you're told there's plenty of food and supplies there... provided you're willing to steal them. With no other viable alternatives, I went. An old man opened the door, telling me his wife is sick, and they cannot share. He stood there, chastising my silent character. And I then had to weigh my group's survival versus terrorizing an old couple's home."", 'Four hours later, I returned home with enough supplies to eat for a week straight.', 'A week and a half later, my scavenger still hadnt forgiven himself.', ""Remorse is actually a tangible, ugly thing to visit upon the survivors in This War of Mine. Remorse causes characters to move slower, hang their heads, decide not to perform simple tasks due to the pointlessness of it all. Your friends at home may feel overwhelming guilt about using stolen goods. And left unchecked, such guilt can fester into crippling depression and, worse, lead to suicide. And it's one of the more gut-wrenching ways your little settlement can fall to pieces--though there are also far more obvious ways. like getting shot, stabbed, beaten, and, of course, starving to death. Your job, as player, is to fight the good fight, but not against military bullets and bombs, or an invading army; you instead have to maintain everything else that's left in the ashes of their wake."", 'What follows is an oppressively somber 2.5D version of The Sims, rendered in a beautiful, but portentous, constantly moving pencil art style. You start with three survivors who have taken shelter in a dilapidated three-story house: two childhood friends, and a displaced TV chef who just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. The game doesn\'t give you a tutorial on how to use anything, but it\'s simple enough to suss out after only a few minutes. By day, food and shelter must be meticulously prepared, and the convenient tools of modern living we all take for granted are now scarce or need to be built completely from scratch. By night, new supplies must be scavenged from the surrounding areas while you pray no one had the same idea about looting your place. Thankfully, the game doesn\'t go for complete realism, i.e. you never have to wonder why an ex-football player knows how to build a full kitchen range out of a box of random crap and a wooden plank. Your supplies are kept under simple headings like ""electronics,"" ""fuel,"" and ""parts,"" and as long as you have enough of them, you can run to your workbench and craft anything you need at will, from creature comforts like chairs and beds, to simple survival tools like small animal traps and rainwater collectors; you can also do more complex stuff like fixing broken guns and armor.', 'The trick, of course, is actually having the resources or even the energy for any of that. When you start the game, all of your survivors are starving, one is wounded, and one is sick. Tending to them is the top priority, so you have to scrounge around the house first for enough materials to build beds, or find food, or build a crude stove. But what if you run out of materials early? Who gets to sleep in a bed instead of on the floor? Who gets to eat tonight? Is someone sick or wounded enough to warrant spending the resources on meds instead of a shovel to dig out debris? Later on, this gives way to bigger concerns, such as whether your housemates harbor resentment for something you did while scavenging the previous night, or whether theyll sink into depression due to scraping by on raw food, with no distractions or simple pleasures like books, coffee, moonshine, or cigarettes. How is a character going to react if you have to burn the last book in the house to heat the place for another night?', ""And so, you scavenge. You can visit a single location every night, with a helpful screen telling you the current situation around the place, rumors you've heard, and what could be contained inside, and you can then search around for anything that might be of use. Some nights, especially early on, you get lucky, and the chosen location is completely abandoned, meaning you can take your time, keep tabs on what your house needs, and walk away with enough food and supplies for a few days, as well as enough resources to make serious improvements. And then come the times when you run into other people."", ""Interactions with other people can go all sorts of ways here. My first encounter with another person was at a supermarket--a gun-wielding man with a bandana over his face, telling his people what to look for. When he turns and sees me, there's a moment of dread where I don't know how, or even if, I should take a swing before he pulls the trigger. To my complete relief, he says there's plenty for everyone, and to feel free to explore. He and his people completely leave me to my own devices the whole night. There are occasional surprises like this in This War of Mine, where your faith in other people is rewarded. People remember when you're good to them, and come to your aid when you least expect it. People randomly share what they have if you do the same. More than once, a couple living a few doors down came by with vegetables right when things were looking their darkest, thanks to sending someone to help clear the debris in their home a few days before."", ""But of course, there's the other side of things. Late in my first playthrough, I happened upon a woman trying to barter for supplies from a soldier, who ends up asking for sexual favors in return. Unfortunately, the game's simple nature gets in the way, here. There's no way to knock, or sneak up behind someone, or even grab a chunk of rock to throw. So, when it becomes obvious this isn't going to go well, I barge in, crowbar in hand. I'm promptly shot dead for my efforts."", 'It\'s that moment that tended to define my interactions with people afterward. If I\'m desperate enough to steal, I\'m desperate enough to shoot/strike first and ask no questions later. New survivors would come to my door, asking for a place to stay, and for a while, I kept wondering if they were dangerous and, more importantly, did I really have the ability to support another hungry mouth? In playthroughs that reached later in the month, the answer was increasingly, heartbreakingly ""no.""', 'Even when the answer was yes, at times when my house legitimately flourished without the need to harm another soul--as much as it could flourish anyway--the biggest problem then came down to sheer boredom. The tedium of living day by day, carefully scraping for supplies, creating a house routine, listening to the radio and praying for a booming ""THE WAR IS OVER!"" announcement that never comes, it starts to bear down on you more than even seeing housemates get attacked or killed. Even in relative prosperity, you\'re still stuck in this place every day in a non-stop holding pattern, until, indeed, the food runs out.', ""And that's perhaps the ultimate point of This War of Mine: It doesn't stop. Survival when you're so disconnected from the things that right now make us full, happy, and human is monotonous. It's boring, and sad, and ongoing. For my part, I had a constant vision in my head that the events of a random Call of Duty were taking place just beyond the northern reaches of the map, and despite having that constantly in mind, in the moment, how many terrorists were being eliminated with extreme prejudice didn't matter. A helicopter rescue was always going to be there for those guys, taking them back to home base. There's no such rescue coming for my survivors. The achievements, and dudebro camaraderie seemed especially silly then, when I hadnt been able to provide a hot meal for someone in three days and he was rocking himself to sleep in a corner because his best friend got shot last night, all because we needed to build someone a heater for when it got cold."", ""Is this a game you want to play? No. Is it a game anyone with a beating heart should play? Yes. A million times yes. It's a longform exercise in empathy, a sobering piece of work that fills in the blanks left when all we see of war are the headshots. It's a much-needed course correct in the current shoot-first-ask-questions-never gaming landscape that supposes war is won because one supreme badguy caught a bullet through his brainstem. No: It's won when the people who lived under his boot get to go home.""]"Justin Clark,17-Nov-14,A Bird Story Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/a-bird-story-review/1900-6415961/,8,PC,"[""Developer Kao Gan's previous title, the nigh-universally lauded To The Moon, was a long, poetic missive on the nature of memories, human interaction, the power of fantasy, and the acceptance of death."", ""A Bird Story is, technically, a follow up. It's running off the same classic 16-bit RPG engine, with only one button and the arrows/joypad required to move around. The same dreamy logic and aesthetic carries over here, where the world is one of constantly shifting landscapes, where trees move themselves out of the way to guide you along the right path, where rooms and forests bleed together, where there's unspoken magic being utilized by every character, and other humans are little but faceless shadows. The score is hewn from the same sweet, uplifting stuff as before as well. And about there is where the comparisons end. A Bird Story's lofty ambitions begin and end with the fact that its most fantastical set piece involves taking a trek around the world on a giant paper airplane made from the pages of a schoolbook. Past that, it's almost laughable how much simpler a concept it is: A lonely boy plays hooky from school one day and finds a bird with a broken wing being chased by a badger. He scares the badger off, goes off on his merry way, and finds out afterwards that he has a fine, feathered stowaway in his backpack."", ' ', ""Knowing what we know about human-meets-fragile animal tales, knowing what we know about A Bird Story's creator, you probably know every step of the way exactly where A Bird Story's going to go long before it gets there. It's a thoroughly uncomplicated tale. But this is not a game about goals and twists. It's the journey. A Bird Story's strengths are all in the execution, the narrative playing out in silence but grabbing you anyway, encouraging you to never miss a chance to develop the protagonist, to discover him as a playful, thoughtful child. He's the kind of kid who keeps to himself at school but can't leave a room in his house without jumping on the bed once or twice or pretending he's The Legend of Zelda's Link when he obtains his lunch for the day."", ""To The Moon's density of plotting is completely muted here, leaving only the silent, untranslatable actions of both the boy, and the tentative trust of the injured bird to fill the narrative void. There's a power in that minimalism. Actions have to speak louder than text boxes here, and there's a master's grasp on how to make interactivity mean something again here by giving control back to the player only for maximum impact, be it letting the silent young protagonist skip through puddles on the way home from school, breaking apart the bread so that the bird can eat, or the hard gut stab that comes from the game's final sequences, a long, literal flight of fancy to try to find the bird's family. The effects of our protagonist being a latchkey kid play itself out only in his reaction to the consistent, growing piles of reminder notes scattered around his apartment that need to be collected when he returns home, and it all seems pointless until the pile of notes turns into a hollow, desolate feeling near the climax."", ' ', ""Earnestness is the programming language that A Bird Story's written in, with every design decision made to give what could very easily have been a sweetheart of a short film a crucial, bracing shot of player agency. There is not a single disingenuous moment in the game's short length, not a single play for emotion that feels manipulative so much as earned by what the player's had to do for the sake of a burgeoning friendship. And the game is effortless in its ability to coax the emotional investment necessary to make A Bird Story work. It strips away the need to tell its audience what childhood feels like and what a new friendship looks like and engages them with it, lets them play with sheer innocence for a while and consequently have to deal with the moments when that innocence is no longer useful or even the best decision."", ""The end result is a small, simple, but incredibly affecting story that showcases the power of the ability to encourage empathy through the most basic expressions of humanity and imagination. We could've gotten A Bird Story in any other medium, but the experience of it would've been diminished as anything but a game.""]"Kevin VanOrd,17-Nov-14,Far Cry 4 Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/far-cry-4-review/1900-6415960/,7,Xbox One & PS4,"['Pagan Min is a nasty piece of work. He is the vain and arrogant despot that welcomes you to the fictional Himalayan nation of Kyrat with a depraved display of violence. Min is a horrific man, and you are meant to despise him--or at least, it would seem so until he ends his tirade by inviting you to ""tear shit up"" while The Clash takes over the soundtrack, preparing you for a power fantasy just seconds after the game has purposefully turned your stomach. Afterwards, Min covers your head with a sack and escorts you to his opulent residence. There, in sight of a bowl of monkey heads ready to be cracked open and engorged upon, He again demonstrates his ruthlessness by plunging a fork into the back of your local guide and forcing him to wail out the window for help.', 'Far Cry 4 is loaded with such tonal shifts, so many that you might suspect the game is trying to make a point with them. The writing takes rare turns into the self-aware; one character, for instance, calls out the hypocrisy of an American intruding on the affairs of a foreign state, pointing guns and splattering blood in the name of ""doing the right thing."" But if Far Cry 4 was meant to parody the violent themes it depicts, it does a poor job of it. You are Ajay Ghale, an American who has come to Kyrat to scatter your departed mother\'s ashes per her wishes, though it isn\'t long before you have taken up the cause of The Golden Path, the same separatist group your mother helped found. Where matters of the rebellion are concerned, Far Cry 4 keeps things serious, often forcing you to choose between the wishes of the current Golden Path co-leaders, and locking yourself into one mission while foregoing its counterpart. These leaders--Amita and Sabal--both have good intentions, seeking only the best for their impoverished nation, though Sabal\'s insistence at one point that Amita is using her gender as a manipulation tactic makes it clear that he, and the game itself, don\'t always represent meaningful progress.', ""It's impossible to be invested in these characters, however, not after a pseudo-serious speech is followed by a confrontation with two embarrassing stoners who blow smoke in your face while embodying every possible drug-culture caricature. The story's best asset, its villain, disappears for most of the story, leaving more dialogue to a local radio personality who fantasizes about becoming a serial killer who smears feces on his victims as a calling card. Far Cry 4 does not improve upon Far Cry 3's narrative issues, but amplifies them until the story collapses into a pile of yee-haw hillbilly language, cliched tribalism, and weak political posturing. For a game primarily interested in providing a joyous first-person sandbox, Far Cry 4 is oddly adamant about choking you with its meager attempts to titillate."", ""Like the Nepalese-esque environments it depicts, Far Cry 4 is all about highs and lows, suffocating you with poor storytelling before setting you free into the wilderness to create thrills of your own. And those thrills can be almost overwhelming, providing the kind of headrush that was Far Cry 3's calling card. It is you and a giant map dotted with activities, each one fun enough that you want to rush towards the waypoint to see what's in store there."", ""Perhaps it's an outpost that need liberating from Min's army. You can force freedom upon it by sneaking around, stabbing baddies from behind and throwing knives into their comrades' foreheads in one smooth motion. But Far Cry 4's additions are tailored towards chaos, and it's difficult to escape their gravity. Throwing a simple slab of meat invites a tiger or a bear (or even a violent honey badger, a reference that would have been dated even a few years ago) to the bloody party. The creature isn't a familiar--it may turn on you once it's done feasting on Min's soldiers' meat--so there's only minor guilt in throwing a molotov cocktail into the mix and watching the flaming feline strike fear into your foes' hearts. Of course, you might be sprinting about all the while, spraying AK-47 fire around, or lobbing grenades from your launcher, the most effective sidearm available in the early game."", ""Or perhaps you believe in truly going big. Elephants may seem like peaceful titans, but once mounted, they are one of Far Cry 4's most destructive forces. One story mission puts pachyderms to particularly good use, offering you plentiful opportunities to overturn oncoming vehicles with a quick flip of the trunk. You haven't truly lived until you have launched an opposing soldier into the air and heard his screams. If you come to games to feel powerful, Far Cry 4 quenches that need. That isn't to say the game is easy; insta-fail stealth missions and enemy artillery can bring the frustration, but you typically have the tools to counter it. If sneaking around is making you swear, a bow and arrow will do nicely. If you're being mobbed, you can spend a token that spawns an AI companion to fight at your side."", ""It is you and a giant map dotted with activities, each one fun enough that you want to rush towards the waypoint to see what's in store there."", ""Real-life companions are even better. A buddy (or stranger) can join you on your adventure, and the two of you become a kind of madcap duo, wreaking even more havoc on Kyrat's struggling economy by ruining and pillaging everything in sight. It's fun to get around in Far Cry 4's dinky gyrocopters, but the real joy is grappling to it and swinging to and fro as your comrade rises into the air. Should an enemy helicopter whir into view, it's tempting to take it out with a rocket, but you could always have your friend swing you into range, and blast the copter's pilot with a shotgun to the face. Should a pack of dholes (wild dogs, that is) attack, it's nice to shoot and skin them with a pal at your side. There's a pleasant sense of camaraderie to it, the two of you tromping through a creek on elephants like a gray, wrinkly caravan."", ""Far Cry 4 isn't content to simply provide a map loaded with icons to chase: it parades activities in front of you as if it's afraid you'll not notice just how much stuff there is to do. You liberate an outpost and drive away, and you're bombarded in ten seconds by notifications that it is already under attack. Should you return and provide support, your next departure might be met with the same instructions; should you drive off, Far Cry 4 informs you of your failure to protect the outpost. I'm grateful for the game's imperfect but helpful auto-drive feature, which allows you to hand over the wheel to the AI if you want to focus on firing your pistol at pursuing ATVs. I'm not so grateful for Far Cry 4's habit of moving the waypoint icon to nearby outposts under attack on my behalf, thus causing my vehicle to drive where the game wants, not where I want. Why is such a massive sandbox so eager to lure me away from my own adventure? Why would a game whose best story is the one I make for myself keep thrusting some other story in front of me, making me eat my broccoli before I'm allowed to have dessert?"", ""At least the dessert is scrumptious, supported by Far Cry 4's excellent economy, which dangles goodies in front of you and dares you to go earn enough rupees to buy them. Soon you discover that your wallet needs upgrading before you can hold more rupees, and that your backpack only holds so many saleable doodads until you craft a larger one. And so off you go to hunt and skin the wildlife so that you may turn their hides into a bigger ammo pouch. You obsessively snatch herbs and flowers so you can make healing syringes and other helpful implements, and climb radio towers so that you can lift the nearby fog of war and reveal even more activities to perform. It's easy to be ensnared by this web of stuff, wanting a thing that requires that you do another thing, which in turn requires that you do even another thing. Of course, that stuff follows a recipe Ubisoft has been stewing for years now, which is filling but starting to taste too familiar. This is the Far Cry/Assassin's Creed/Watch Dogs formula on hyperdrive: no piece of real estate is safe from the stuff-web."", ' ', ""The story at least provides plenty of diversity. Sometimes, you're pumped full of drugs and float away to Shangri-la, where you admire the dreamy visuals and sic tigers on demons; sometimes, you're maintaining oxygen levels while exploring the perilous heights of the Himalayas. Far Cry 3's missions ultimately made the greater impression: Far Cry 4's drug-destroying quest owes a clear debt to its predecessor's similar (and better) analog, and 3's hallucinogenic trips were more memorable than the sojourns to Shangri-la. Even so, Far Cry 4's best missions make good use of the game's general scale, providing intricate spreads of horizontal and vertical spaces, and giving you the freedom to approach them as you like."", ""The ties to earlier Ubisoft games are inescapable. You tear propaganda posters from walls in the manner of Assassin's Creed II, and unveil new portions of the map in the manner of, well, most recent Ubisoft games. The condensed freeform missions, on the other hand, are more akin to Splinter Cell: Blacklist, though that isn't the only feature reminiscent of Sam Fisher's more recent games. Far Cry 4 features a light bit of competitive play that pits two asymmetrical teams against each other. The objectives change depending on which mode you choose, but the basics remain the same. One group plays as hunters, armed with bows and arrows, and capable of going invisible and mounting elephants; the other drives standard vehicles and selects from a full array of weapons, approaching battle with sheer force."", ""The best part of competitive play is that it offers many of the campaign's freedoms. You can ride the winds in your wingsuit towards a capture point, create ad-hoc walls of flame with molotovs, and snipe a competitor while he struggles to fend off an attacking bird of prey. Teams also seek to control towers that reveal hunters on the minimap (or remove them), which adds another speck of strategy to the proceedings. These five-on-five matches are open-ended delights, not so much because the battles are loaded with tension, but because they reward adaptability, and in doing so, echo the campaign."", ""It's a problematic campaign, certainly, forcing you to restart an entire mission from scratch if you arrive at your destination and realize you'd like a different loadout, and making you reach for the radio dial so you don't have to listen to the worst radio personality this side of the Great Wall of China. It's when you circumvent Far Cry 4's major thematic flaws, inconsistent missions, and incessant nagging that you find the game you came looking for, breathing easy and enjoying the mountains that rise in the distance and the valleys that stretch beneath you. Like the terrain if depicts, Far Cry 4 travels both high and low, representing the good, the bad, and ugly of video games all at once.

And yet, despite my best efforts, with one poorly-taken corner on my bike, it all goes wrong. I should be driving down a dank sewer tunnel, sneaking my way under the city to freedom. Instead, I'm here, mowing down wave after wave of police on the city streets, and for the first time while playing a Grand Theft Auto game, I feel immensely guilty about it."", ""This isn't because of some grand moral awakening on my part, but an interesting side effect of what is the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One version of GTA V's most compelling new feature: first-person mode. Even when GTA games were top-down shooters, there was always something of a disconnect between the sometimes shockingly violent scenes on-screen, and the mentality of the player. You could imagine that, despite directly controlling a character, it was this virtual caricature of a criminal committing the crimes--you merely played witness to them. First-person mode fundamentally changes how you view GTA V's world. It has the power to make you stop and think about your actions, and to deeply question a character's motivations. And in a series that has long been criticized for glorifying a life of crime, rather than questioning it, this is no bad thing."", ""Yes, there are plenty of violent first-person shooters around in which issues of morality can be raised, but few are paired with the stunning Hollywood production values of GTA V. The city of Los Santos is one of the most beautiful and convincing open-world environments to have ever graced a video game, and in its new higher-resolution guise, it's even more spectacular. Compared to the last-gen versions, the new GTA V is noticeably sharper, largely thanks to improved antialiasing. Textures resolutions have been bumped, surfaces are, well, bumpier (thanks enhanced tessellation), and there are all manner of new particle, light, and lens effects. You can cruise down Vespucci Beach and pick out little details in its trinket stores and skateboard shops that weren't there before. You can drive around in the rain, marvelling at the beautifully rendered raindrops and puddles on the ground. And when you stop admiring the scenery to cause some anarchy, explosions from a hastily thrown grenade pop in a dazzling display of fire and light."", ""To admire this all in first-person is a delight. The wide, cinematic field of view is very different to that of your typical shooter, as is the slower pace with which you walk; think P.T. and you're on the right track. Where the camera once easily tilted up above and around the city, at ground level everything looks bigger and more imposing. I found myself walking along the city streets, watching as the many weird and wonderful citizens of Los Santos went about their business. I wandered into shops, even those where I couldn't buy anything, just to admire the astonishing level of detail at eye level, with nifty depth of field effects helping to sell the immersion. It's all very lifelike, the gentle head bobs and animations as you leap over walls and tumble out of cars drawing you into the game in a way that third-person mode never could."", ""This is especially true when the action heats up, and where the grizzly reality of GTA V comes into sharp focus. With most missions revolving around some form of gunplay, the bloody splatter of a drug dealer laid to waste on the sidewalk, or the groans of an injured cop writing on the hood of his car have far more of an effect than before. Of course, not everyone will be as affected by this as I was, but there are some practical points to ponder too. Shooting and throwing explosives is easier in first-person, even with GTA's assisted aim disabled--provided you turn down the obscene levels of controller sensitivity before you start--but the cover system isn't quite there, and there were times when I wasn't able to peek around a corner properly and got shot as a result."", ""Then there's the driving, which, no matter how hard I tried, I found far too difficult to master in first-person. The fully working and wonderfully detailed vehicle interiors might be impressive, but the twitchy controls that work so well in third-person for pulling off outrageous driving stunts are just far too sensitive to easily keep cars on the road during a frantic police chase. There are also vehicle missions that simply weren't designed with first-person in mind either. Trying to catch Michael's son as he dangles off a boat on the highway, or performing a speeding drive by on the highway is very difficult. It's arguably more realistic, but I found myself switching back to third-person in order to get them done. Thankfully, it's not an either or situation when it comes to your viewpoint. You can drive in third-person and have the game automatically switch to first-person when on-foot if you like, or even pan out to third-person when you take cover."", ""But even if you choose to ignore first-person mode completely, GTA V has lost little of its lustre since release. Even now, after the years of progress in the industry and all the wonderful games that I've played, I'm surprised how few have managed to replicate the Hollywood feel and effortless, natural dialogue of a GTA. This is a series that has consistently been the most convincing and the most cinematic in games, and GTA V continues that tradition with aplomb. Even something as basic as credible characters are a rarity, and yet GTA V manages to create a whole city full of them, as well as three authentic leads with which to journey through it. That's not to say these leads are likeable characters, but perhaps that's the point. There may be a few times you sympathise with retired gangster Michael as his family life crumbles around him, or when you believe that wannabe gangster Franklin might be a nice guy just because he says he's always trying to do the right thing."", ""But these are narcissistic, psychopathic killers who don't blink an eyelid at killing hundreds of perfectly innocent people when it serves their own means. This is particularly true of Trevor, who remains far and away the most interesting and well-written character of the lot, a terrifyingly insane yet remarkably intelligent criminal who constantly seems on the edge of some kind of mental breakdown. Scary doesn't even begin to describe it. These characters are not without fault, though--there are moments when a character will contradict his own motivations, seemingly just to fit the structure of a mission--but the fact that these characters can be so convincingly terrifying, and so sharp and snappy in their interactions with one another is a testament to just how fantastic the writing in GTA is."", 'This is a series that has consistently been the most convincing and the most cinematic in games, and GTA V continues that tradition with aplomb.', ""That extends to the world at large too: the sprawling, gorgeously detailed metropolis of Los Santos deftly satirizes its real-world inspiration of Los Angeles, and of America as whole. Highlights include the self-proclaimed god of social media, Lifeinvader CEO Jay Norris, And his company's beanbag-filled offices; the constant barrage of adverts for celebrity magazines, prescription drugs, and plastic surgeries that are savaged on the radio; and the corrupt government agencies like the FiB that often act worse than the criminals they're trying to put away. Sure, GTA V is sometimes heavy-handed with its satire, but there are few games that dare go as far as GTA does with its nihilistic commentary, and fewer still that do it with such conviction."", ""Running through it all are bombastic missions that play out like Hollywood blockbusters, and the finest of gangster films. Heists remain the highlight, and the whole process of planning them out, hiring members of the team, gathering equipment, and then hoping that the fuzz doesn't interfere on the big day is utterly engrossing. Bombs are exploded, helicopters are smashed into the side of skyscrapers, and entire squads of police give chase as you make a futile attempt escape down the highway; the sheer thrill of a four or five star chase as what seems like the entire state's quota of law enforcement descends upon you cannot be understated. And yet, GTA V remains stuck in the past in some ways. There are chase missions where losing sight of your target thanks to a poorly taken turn on the highway means making a frustrating restart, and assassination missions where, if you jump the gun and kill your target before the game expects you to, you have to start over again."", ""But the sheer spectacle of it all drags you back in for more. GTA has never really been subtle, and the game steamrolls its way through its less exciting moments, filling them with crafty pop culture-filled conversations and breathtaking landscapes for you to ogle. There are extra missions to play too, including the random creeps of Los Santos who ask you to do things as mundane as tow trucks for them, or to smoke weed and mow down aliens in an hallucinogenic rampage through the city. There are the multiple leisure activities you can indulge in, or the real estate you can buy, and the stocks you invest in along with the markets you can manipulate. Or you can just slack it all off completely and use Los Santos as your own wonderful digital playground, setting up sticky bomb-filled booby traps in the middle of traffic, or stealing jumbo jets from the airport and trying to fly them under bridges. Indeed, it's the adventures you create yourself that often prove to be the most fun."", ""And then there's GTA Online. It's safe to say GTA Online didn't get off to a good start, with server issues and all manner of balance problems. With GTA V, online gets a few boosts, including an enhanced character creator, as well as support for up to 30 simultaneous players (with two additional spectators), and the inclusion of all 11 of GTA Online's existing updates. And yes, you can play in first-person too. These are nice additions, but Online still suffers from a lack of direction. Although you can easily import your old character, I opted to create a new one, after which I was dumped onto a sidewalk in Los Santos armed only with a map full of confusing icons and little idea about what I should do next."", ""Once you're over the hump and you've figured out the process of finding jobs to do like stealing packages from characters, or taking part in street races--and people to do them with via your trusty mobile phone--things get more interesting. Once you've built up a suitable pile of cash (which does take some time if you're starting from scratch), you can buy a nice apartment to stay in, and fancy cars to put in its garage. To what end, I'm still not sure. Much has been said about how GTA online is too open, and how sessions often turn into mass deathmatches, which is even more of an issue with 30 chaotic players around--but for me that's always been part of its draw. Trolling someone who's taken themselves far too seriously in a street race by creating an epic roadblock, or simply roaming the streets robbing convenience stores and then performing a smooth getaway still manages to raise a smile."", ""That these activities raise a smile here (even when played in first-person), and yet throw up a moral dilemma in single-player is as much to do with the lack of a narrative structure online as it is to do with my own personal feelings towards most other internet users. It raises an interesting conundrum too: is it better to play in first-person and be moved by GTA V's events in a more profound way, or should you play in the third-person, distancing yourself from the game's more controversial moments?"", ""The fact that I'm even thinking about this at all in a video game that's as popular and as, well, mainstream as GTA V is a testament to its quality. Over a year later, GTA V remains one of the most consistently entertaining video games I've ever played. Even without the spectacular new visuals, first-person mode, the epic new rail gun, the new murder mystery missions for Michael, the new, even furrier animals, remote play support on PS4, a mountain of new songs on the radio (including my personal favourite, I Want It That Way by the Backstreet Boys on the pop station), and the return of vehicles like the classic Dodo seaplane, GTA V would be still be worth playing."", ""Aside from a few mild frame rate issues that sometimes take the edge off its more dramatic moments, this is the definitive version of GTA V, and the bar by which all other open-world games, or indeed any game that aims for a cinematic feel, should be judged. It is beautiful, and thought-provoking, and thrilling throughout. Even if you've played through GTA V once already, it's worth going back just to be reminded of what an outstanding achievement it is."", 'At its core, Grand Theft Auto V on PC is the same game that it is on other platforms, and while its never looked as good as it does on a strong PC, anyone whos played GTA V elsewhere may not benefit from buying it for a second or third time unless theyre desperate for better graphics. If you fall into that camp, you can easily transfer your progress over to the PC version via the Rockstar Social Club to continue where you left off, diving headlong into the revamped Los Santos with minimal fuss.', ""It looked great on PS4 and Xbox One, but GTA V shines on PC thanks to 4K-grade textures, the availability of additional post-processing effects, and an unlocked frame rate. Previous versions of the game played just fine at 30 frames per second, but you quickly appreciate the added fluidity of playing at 60 FPS (if not more) on PC. If you can give it enough juice (read: afford top-end gaming hardware), then you can marvel at the added flourishes in 4K, even, but even three Nvidia GTX 980's in SLI couldn't push the highest settings at 4K without dipping to around 30 frames per second. Whether in 4K, or at 1080p, the new high-res textures pop with detail, and new lighting effects lead to plenty of awe inspiring moments. GTA V can paint stunning pictures, with the right mix of scenery, subject, and daylight, that highlight the natural beauty of its geography and the grime that pulses through its concrete veins. GTA V has always looked good, but a great gaming PC is the only way to witness the full extent of Rockstars admirable handiwork."", 'Keep in mind that GTA V retains evidence of its last-gen roots, even on PC, with simple geometry abound. You notice low-poly models on occasion as they contrast with the great texture work and lighting on hand, as simplicity and complexity mix before your eyes. GTA V is impressive at times, but you never forget that youre playing a game thats foundation was built with outdated constraints in mind.', ""You get a unique tool in the PC version that allows you to show off all of the game's flare, as well as your creativity: the Rockstar Editor. This tool allows you to record footage during missions or while free-roaming around Los Santos, either by manually recording gameplay or by sourcing the last few minutes of cached actions. More than simply allowing you to cut together clips, you have full control over the camera while going through your gameplay. You can set your angles manually, choose from a list of preset angles, and apply camera shakiness, redefining the look and perspective of a moment in time. Little touches such as blending make it easy to transition from one clip and camera angle to the next, without having to put much thought into it."", ""In Director mode, you have even more control of the events at hand. You can choose actors, human or animal, to control, rather than being limited to the three main characters. You also have control over time of day, your location on the map, and whether or not cheats are enabled, allowing you to sample from a wide palette of possibilities to craft the scene of your dreams. There's a learning curve to the editor, but Rockstar offers a range of tutorials that should help experienced and inexperienced editors alike."", ""Playing GTA V on PC means that you can now use a mouse and keyboard, which is a huge benefit during shootouts where precision is key. Whether you play it in first- or third-person mode, it clearly makes targeting easier. However, don't think that you should put down the controller for good. Keyboard and mice lack analog buttons, which are key during driving sequences. Being able to control your throttle with a sensitive trigger is something you get used to and manage naturally, often without giving it a second thought. The binary, on or off nature of a keyboard or mouse button gets in the way of your instincts and takes away the nuanced control afforded by analog triggers. For the best experience, keep a controller plugged in and switch between it and a mouse and keyboard for the moment at hand. Chalk it up to hardware standards, rather than Rockstars. - Peter Brown, 4/15/2015, 02:00 PM PDT""]"Jeremy Signor,15-Nov-14,Randal's Monday Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/randal-s-monday-review/1900-6415957/,4,PC,"[""We love point-and-click adventure games because of their uncanny ability to subvert both the written word and the interactivity inherent in games. They can tell stories using stimuli that books just dont have, be they tragedy or comedy. And they can tickle our brains even as they spin a narrative featuring hilarious, strong, memorable characters that stick with us for years. But we also hate these games because of how obtuse progressing through them can be, causing us to spend hours wandering around and using every last item we have on every last interactive element on every last screen. We give ourselves migraines as we attempt to decipher the broken logic of the developers. Yet even with all these fatal flaws, we still hold a rosy view of classic adventure games. Nexus Game Studio loves them, too. In fact, their latest game, Randal's Monday, oozes with love for this genre. Too bad that actually playing it will make you hate not only the genre but also games in general."", ""Oh, the game seems appealing enough at first. The world of Randal's Monday is a nice-looking cartoony world that's still grounded in reality, something akin to any number of adult cartoons you see on late-night TV. And when you're set loose in this world, it doesn't take long for it to open up, giving you access to a city of respectable size to explore. It helps that all kinds of geek references litter the game. It's kind of neat to see references to Portal, The Twilight Zone, Super Ghouls 'n Ghosts, and Fraggle Rock all in the same game. Running around from place to place (made easier thanks to subway-based fast travel) makes for a downright pleasant experience ... at least at first."", ""Its love for the heyday of adventure games is immediately apparent from the get-go. The different-colored lines of dialogue and emphasis on humor feel like classic Lucasarts games out of SCUMM VM, and the way you progress through the game using a pile of seemingly random items is a direct analogue to King's Quest and its ilk. But for all its affection for this bygone era, Randal's Monday lacks the perspective to realize the deep flaws in this style of game, instead mindlessly charging ahead and aping their formulas wholesale while fixing hardly any of them."", 'A great number of the solutions in the game make no logical sense unless you happen to be in the developers\' heads. For instance, to bypass a certain lock, you don\'t have to find a key or even a lockpick. You need to take a small spring out of a broken radio and use a hammer on it to squash it lengthwise. Then, you need to take a clothes hanger and put it into a blender to cut the hanger to a bit of wire, which you can then combine with the squashed spring to make a lockpick to unlock the lock. Convoluted nonsense like this permeates the game even in its simplest solutions, like when you\'re supposed to use a baseball you just found to throw against the wall for ""hours"" to finally wear it down to reveal a pipe, something you wouldn\'t think of unless you tried using the ball on everything in the room, which seems to be what the game expects of its player: Try everything until it works. It\'s no wonder that the ""hint system"" in this game is just an explicit walkthrough.', ""For all its affection for this bygone era, Randal's Monday lacks the perspective to realize the deep flaws in this style of game, instead mindlessly charging ahead and aping their formulas wholesale while fixing hardly any of them."", 'At least the concept behind the game is somewhat original. The titular character comes into contact with a cursed ring that causes him to live the same Monday over and over again, much like Bill Murrays character in the movie Groundhog Day. Here, though, the things that Randal does each Monday persist, and reality bends to make the timeline make sense every new day. This makes for some bizarre situations, like a city infested with koala bears, but the game fails to make much interesting use of this conceit except as a framing device for wacky situations.', ""The influence of Groundhog Day goes beyond the game's premise, though. Randal is a cynical, borderline sociopathic delivery man who has an arsenal of sarcastic comments ready to hurl at people laced with insults and geek references aplenty. In other words, he's an edgier Phil Connors for the gamer generation. But that's all there is to the character, which gives you very little to laugh at when each conversation he wanders into becomes abuse after abuse. And he barely grows as a person by the end, staying exactly as unlikable as he started. Worse, the supporting characters in this story are just like him, giving him cynical lip right back with a low hum of misanthropy. Watching everyone in the game be the same brand of terrible to each other isn't even remotely entertaining."", ""As we know by now, adventure games are not doomed to be mere fossils. Telltale and many other devs have reimagined the genre in many new and exciting directions that honor the legacy of those that came before but without the design baggage that so plagued them in the first place. Randal's Monday is blind hero worship that ignores decades of design theory and leaves an unpleasant aftertaste thanks to its thoroughly unlikable, homogenous cast.""]"Chris Watters,15-Nov-14,Halo: The Master Chief Collection Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/halo-the-master-chief-collection-review/1900-6415958/,6,Xbox One,"['For the better part of this new century, a game with ""Halo"" in the title has been one of the best places to romp around with friends, test your mettle against stiff challenges, and compete for glory on the online stage. Halo: The Master Chief Collection brings four of those games together in one package, and it does so with a crisp, organizational flair that makes it immediately inviting. Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary, Halo 2: Anniversary, Halo 3, and Halo 4 are laid out in such a way that no matter what mode you\'re angling for, it\'s easy to find your way to it, tweak the options just so, and set off down memory lane. Where that road may lead you, however, remains uncertain.', ""If you're undertaking one of the four campaigns, then you're in for a treat. Every mission is available right from the start, so you can head straight to the places you best remember, or start an adventure over from the beginning. It's like traveling through time or unearthing a time capsule, depending on your age, and it can take a little while to get your bearings as you calibrate to the particulars of each game. But once you're well acquainted, the thrills of yesteryear come rushing back. These are campaigns that stand the test of time well and invite replaying, whether it be on a harder difficulty level or just to mess around with vehicle physics on that one level you remember so well."", ""Outside the contained worlds of each game's campaign, however, The Master Chief Collection does not fare as well. Getting attuned to the many classic and anniversary varieties of competitive multiplayer can be disorienting initially, even if you have strong memories of each one. Once you have your bearings, the thrills of combat against your fellow player start to blossom, but getting that far is nearly impossible in the game's current state. Serious matchmaking issues often prevent you from even getting into a game, let alone the type of game you'd prefer. If you manage to get into a match, a host of other problems await, and upon completing a match, you're as likely to crash to the Xbox One dashboard as you are to be placed in another match. Fixes are on the way, according to developer 343 Industries, but as it stands now, The Master Chief Collection does not successfully deliver on its promises."", ""But what promises they are! To revisit the Halo 2 battlegrounds that brought so many people to Xbox Live? To relive the sprawling vehicular battles of Halo 3? To finally play classic Halo: Combat Evolved multiplayer online on a console? These are heady prospects for anyone who's been a fan of Halo over the years, though to actually experience them is something short of pure nostalgic glee. Loading into a multiplayer match can demand some abrupt memory recalibrations, as you pick up a bubble shield for the first time in over six years or try to dual wield a weapon and realize you cannot."", 'And the adjustments run deeper than that. From movement speed to weapon handling and balance, from audio cues to health systems, there are a host of things you need to compensate for when switching from game to game in a multiplayer session. It can be frustrating because one of the powerful draws of competition is the process of learning from your mistakes, adopting new tactics, and then meeting with newfound success. This progression is disrupted when hopping from game to game, but substantially smoother if you stick with one particular game for a while, say, a run of Team Slayer BR in the Halo 2: Anniversary playlist. Once you get that foothold, once you can remove the training wheels that you had to begrudgingly put back on, then you can begin to experience what made these games great.', 'Halo multiplayer has always had a few throughlines, regardless of the changes that helped evolve the series into what it is today. The balanced interplay of the limited array of weapons meant that you could develop strategies for every match-up and adjust your tactics accordingly. Head-on assault, stealth, misdirection, running for another gun, or hopping in a vehicle were all potential options, and they all coalesced to create dynamic battlefields that felt both immensely variable and fundamentally understandable. This sense of control and order amidst the chaos of online combat was crucial to the success of each of these games in its time, and it holds up firmly even now.', ""The multiplayer component of a game, however, is more tied to a moment in time than the campaign is due to its dependence on player population. A recently released game generally has more players regularly online representing a broader spectrum of skills, which leads to a more welcoming environment where people feel like they are finding fair matches. Years after a game's release, the population is whittled down significantly, and any newcomer is likely to feel the sting of the sharpened warriors who still remain. Furthermore, as time passes, players tend to gravitate towards a few preferred game modes, meaning that less popular options will end up essentially unplayable. How The Master Chief Collection will fare in this regard remains a big question, one that is all the more impactful given the sheer range of options that are potentially available. What is the fate of Halo 3 Oddball in a world that vastly prefers Team Slayer?"", 'Though 343 Industries is attempting to manage this question by giving players a small, cultivated list of lobby choices, they are currently struggling to simply get players into games at all. Serious matchmaking issues have rendered online multiplayer extremely difficult to play in the three days since launch. At best, I was able to play three or four matches in one hour; at worst, I played zero. The matches I did play were often underpopulated or lopsided, and when they were over, there was little likelihood of being placed in a lobby for a subsequent match. 343 is posting frequently about server-side updates they are making to try to improve the situation, including one update that completely removed the option for Halo 4 matchmaking. How long will it be until you can reliably join a match within five minutes? When will the full roster of playlists be returned? Only time will tell, but until that time arrives, The Master Chief Collection is a huge disappointment for those who want to test their skills in online competition.', ""If, however, the campaigns are your aim, then you're in luck. The four grand adventures of Master Chief, gathered here with the aforementioned organizational prowess, are still a treat to play through in a variety of ways. Setting off from the start or hopping from mission to mission; trying for a timed speed run or heaping on the skulls to make things tougher; ticking up the difficulty level for a solo or cooperative challenge; all are different ways to romp through these campaigns and each has its own appeal."", ""Take Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary. Released just three years ago, it was the first of Master Chief's jaunts to get the Anniversary treatment. Remastered visuals and audio were crafted to exist alongside the original assets, and you could switch between them with the press of a button. In The Master Chief Collection, seeing the flat-textured landscapes of the halo's surface spring to life with verdant foliage and sparkling rivers is a delight, and the increased color saturation makes your ugly Covenant foes seem all the more sinister. Though the remastered look is a great way to play, it's fun to switch between the two in different environments to see how drastic the difference is. And it's not always the more modern version that looks best, thanks to the alien elegance of the original Forerunner structures."", '""Elegant"" could be a charitable way to describe the even pace with which this first incarnation of Master Chief runs around these levels, or you could take a harsher view and call it ""slow and plodding."" Moving at the speed of 2001 can be initially off-putting, but of course, everything else in this world is designed around Chief moving the way he moves, and this internal consistency helps the adjustment process. As you learn to use the three prongs of Master Chief\'s arsenal--guns, grenades, and melee attacks--all over again, the balance between you and your enemies starts to become clear. Their individual and group tactics are at once formidable and deconstructible, encouraging you to both respect their power and figure out new ways to dismantle them in each new situation. This balance scales nicely as you add skulls, increase the difficulty, or team up with another player.', ""The foundations of Halo's gameplay were established in Combat Evolved, and Halo 2 elaborated on them with a lengthier campaign and a new playable protagonist. Though the story of when humanity first encountered a halo in CE is more highly regarded than Master Chief and the Arbiter's dual adventure in Halo 2, the sequel's campaign still delivers plenty of exciting moments that make it worth playing. The lesser (or perhaps just more convoluted) narrative benefits greatly from the addition of new cutscenes from Blur Studio, the animation house that contributed some excellent sequences to Halo 4. Blur's work here is a tremendous improvement, bringing new life not just to the characters and storyline, but to the world itself. Though they cover the same scenes and same dialogue (you can switch between to two on the fly to double check), they are crafted with a cinematic flair that the originals lacked. There's also some new content packed in for good measure, through in-game terminals and new cutscenes, that offer clues about the next release in the Halo series, Halo 5: Guardians."", 'The Anniversary treatment generally does right by Halo 2 as it does by CE, though there are a few caveats to be aware of. Lighting is a huge area of improvement, for the most part, bringing depth and contrast to levels to make them feel more vibrant. Still, there are times when the saturation goes a bit too far: under aerial bombardment from the Covenant, you may find your screen whited out to the point of blindness and deep in the twisting tunnels of a Forerunner structure, you might resort to swapping to the original visuals (again, with the push of a button) or upping the brightness on your TV to get your bearings.', ""As for the audio side of the remastering, a quick switch reveals just how much fuller and majestic the updated orchestration is. Crossing a suspension bridge in a tank and blasting Covenant vehicles out of the sky is a thrill either way, but it's amped up when you're blasting the robust new remastering of that excellent soundtrack. There are drawbacks, however, some of which will depend on your taste in weapon audio. The galloping clatter of the submachine gun has been replaced with a brasher, more metallic sound that I found more bland than the original, and while the original sniper rifle sounded like every shot rang out from a mountain top, the new one is a more perfunctory blast. Sounds like these made me wish for the option to pick and choose between remastered and original, but no such option exists."", ""Halo 3 is pointedly not an Anniversary edition, though both it and Halo 4 (and the two Anniversary editions) have been updated to run at 1080p resolution and 60 frames per second. You'll miss Blur's H2A handiwork when you watch Halo 3's cutscenes, but when it comes to playing the game, you're in for a treat. Halo 3's campaign really feels like the one in which Bungie nailed what it meant to be Halo. The through lines are still there from the beginning, including the balance of weapons, the enemy tactics, and the frequency and flexibility of vehicuar combat. In Halo 3, the campaign flows deftly between diverse environments, giving you an array of ways to tackle a given situation."", ""The key here is replayability; this array of options isn't really necessary, or even fully exploitable, on one playthrough. Playing by yourself, with a friend, with some weird modifiers, or on a tougher difficulty level all provide different scenarios you have to figure out and all bring different options to the fore. A stiff challenge might make you experiment with creative new solutions, or a lighter one might urge you to try daring stunts where solid tactics would work just fine. In cultivating this flexibility, Halo 3 delights in your successes, punishes your failures, motivates you to be better, and inspires you to be creative, which are some of the best things a video game can do."", ""Halo 3 brought the first Halo trilogy to a close, and never is this more apparent than when playing Halo 4. The 2012 release signals a new start in a number of ways: Master Chief can now sprint for the first time and use the mobility-enhancing armor abilities introduced in Halo: Reach. For a man used to going one speed, it feels significantly different and more modern, a distinction that also becomes clear in multiplayer matches. Halo 4 introduces new enemies that challenge Master Chief with their maddening ability to shield each other, and also introduces new allies, who challenge Master Chief by not treating him like the unimpeachable hero warrior of the past. Seeing commanders talk brusquely and disrespectfully to the Chief is as much a signal of the new era as anything, and it's delivered with the best characterization, dialogue, and cinematography that the series has seen to date."", ""Though the action is peppier thanks to the new locomotion options, the core tenets of combat design that sustained the Halo series for so long are still in full effect. The new complement of weapons, abilities, and enemies carry the torch of diversity and flexibility proudly through the transition; Halo 4 was the first Halo developed entirely by 343 Industries and not Halo's creators, Bungie. It's also the best-looking game in the Collection, and though you can see its age relative to more recent releases, it's still a vivid, attractive game."", ""And it's a testament to the quality of Halo games throughout the years that Halo: The Master Chief Collection is an attractive package, despite the massive problems with online multiplayer. It's not a game that demands to be played, not in the way that a new game or a new entry in a beloved series might. Instead, it's a game that makes a strong case to be owned, to be put on your digital shelf for when you've got an old friend coming by, or are hankering to revisit familiar battlegrounds. And even if you don't have much experience with all the games contained herein, the way that they're all arranged in an immensely accessible way makes it easy to fire it up, play a few rounds or take on a few levels, and then put it down until the next time the mood strikes you. The Master Chief Collection is inviting, illuminating as it does the enduring appeal of the Halo series: to create worlds that are epic showpieces and elaborate playgrounds, places to triumph and places to play.""]"Mark Walton,15-Nov-14,Assassin's Creed Rogue Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/assassin-s-creed-rogue-review/1900-6415955/,6,Xbox 360,"[""The cynic in me wants to say to that Assassin's Creed Rogue is little more than a glorified add-on, one last-ditch effort to squeeze some cash from the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 generation--and in many ways, it is. But after sailing the high seas as an Assassin turned Templar, I think it's more apt to think of Rogue as a cheeky but uninspired farewell, a piece of fan service that ties up some loose ends, and gives those absorbed in the overarching Abstergo arc answers to some of its more complex questions."", ""Those answers are, unfortunately, buried in a serviceable, if predictable story. The hero--or anti-hero in this case--is Shay Patrick Cormac, a gruff, moody Assassin out for revenge after becoming disillusioned with the brotherhood. Yes, the Assassin's Creed series still hasn't discovered that there are character motivations outside of surly angry dude, with Shay spending most of his time shouting at and killing other surly angry dudes, before going off on his own to stare off into space, and contemplate why everyone is just so gosh darn mean to him."", ""So no, the core character story isn't going to keep you glued to the screen, particularly as the voice acting with its dodgy Irish accents is less-than-convincing. But, while I've never cared for it much myself, the surrounding lore is going to be of huge interest to series fans. Rogue fills in many of the gaps between ACIII and Black Flag by diving into the Abstergo and Templar conspiracies, and making you think about their motivations. Perhaps Abstergo isn't the evil organization its been made out to be. Perhaps the Assassin's aren't always in the right. That Rogue doesn't paint a picture of black and white is one of its greatest strengths."", ""A lot of this is accomplished during the historical missions (which take place between 1752 and 1761), but there's also a return to the often derided modern day first-person sections of Black Flag. Thankfully, these sections are much shorter this time around, and--save for a painfully perky Abstergo employee--rather pleasant. There's a lot of information to uncover, from datapads with tongue-in-cheek references to other Assassin's Creed games, to computers with Assassin profiles that are unlocked via a nifty puzzle minigame. That's not to mention the Abstergo Entertainment offices themselves, which are littered with all manner of Easter eggs not just from Assassin's Creed, but from other Ubisoft games too."", ""As for the historical missions, well, a cliche it may be, but given that Rogue is mechanically identical to Black Flag, if you weren't into the boats and battles on the high seas, Rogue is certainly not going to change your mind on the matter. The only real difference here is the setting--places like the frozen North Atlantic, the Appalachian River Valley, and New York--and the size of your ship, which is smaller and sleeker and ideal for traversing the smaller waters of inland America."", ""Sadly, those waters are far less glamorous than the lush beaches and crystal clear waters of the Caribbean, and they're far more sparsely populated too. Story-driven side quests are few and far between, replaced instead with items to collect, buildings to upgrade, and gang bases to liberate. The latter are the most entertaining. Hunting for the gang's leader using Eagle Vision and sneakily stalking him atop buildings, are some of the most tense and exciting moments in the game."", ""That there's a lack of interesting missions aside from base liberations and building upgrades is something of a wasted opportunity, particularly as one of the largest locations you can visit--the 1700s recreation of New York with its wooden houses and cobbled streets--is an impressive sight to behold. Only a few of the core story missions even take place in the city, and without much in the way of side quests, even a dramatic visage wasn't enough to make me want to explore it to its fullest."", ""More disappointing is that the story missions that do happen in New York, and indeed around each of Rogue's islands, just aren't that interesting. For a game with Assassin in the title, there aren't actually a whole lot of assassination missions to play through, and those that are there tend to involve your target running off (whether you've been detected or not) and you chasing them around the city while they drop smoke bombs, or fire shots at you from a distance. The slow, methodical, and far more interesting assassinations that you'd hope for are few and far between."", ""And so it falls to the seafaring missions to pick up the slack. The thrill of sailing on the open sea hasn't lost any of its charm, even if the environments themselves are a little less alluring. Sailing over the Atlantic, seeing humpback whales belly flop their way across the water as your motley crew sings a hearty sea shanty still manage to stir up a thrill. Naval battles are par for the course, but there sadly aren't enough of them to warrant spending a whole lot of time upgrading your ship, or venturing out to pick up stranded crew members and supplies."", ""Those that are there are fun, each battle being far more strategic than you might imagine. You're encouraged to take stock of the situation during the bigger battles, assessing the size and your enemies and figuring out who's best to pelt with long range mortars, and who's best to get up close with and unleash a barrage of cannon fire. But you can't help but feel that with the slim amount of missions on offer both out at sea and on dry land that you're getting a raw deal. There's not even any multiplayer to round things out."", ""Outside of a few additions like an air rifle and grenade launcher (which is used exactly one for mission), there's next to nothing in Rogue that moves the franchise forward. And even if you simply wanted more of Black Flag, that the missions are so sparse makes it difficult to want to drag yourself across the vast expanse of Rogue's oceans. Instead of a rich, fleshed-out game, Rogue is a short, mildly entertaining adventure that's thin on core content, but thick with information. It's intriguing information though, particularly if you're a series fan, just don't expect the best of adventures while you're taking it all in."", ' ']"Don Saas,14-Nov-14,Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sonic-boom-rise-of-lyric-review/1900-6415956/,2,Wii U,"[""Speed, agility, and precision were the keys to making the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise one of gaming's earliest touchstones, but somewhere along the line Sega lost sight of what makes the series work. Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric has a laundry list of problems, and not just problems inherent to the modern Sonic franchise, but failings of basic design."", ""Rise of Lyric is crafted as a prequel to the brand new Sonic Boom cartoon, and it attempts to serve as an introduction to the Sonic universe for a brand new generation of fans. Sarcastic spiky blue hedgehog Sonic is joined by his pals--bullheaded Knuckles, geeky Tails, and spunky Amy--on a mission to stop the technocratic lizard Lyric from wiping out all organic life on their planet as the villainous but inept Dr. Eggman complicates everyone's plans. Unfortunately, though, the story never manages to get off the ground."", ' ', 'Players control Sonic and his three friends through a mix of combat, exploration, platforming, and speed-running. Each playable character has a suite of unique abilities. Sonic is the fastest and can use his speed dash to fly over ramps or bounce off levitating speed balls. Tails can hover in the air and use an array of gadgets to reach inaccessible areas. Knuckles is the strongest and can also cling to red crystalline surfaces to traverse the environment. And Amy can triple jump and engage in light acrobatics on pink balance beams.', ""Unfortunately, while Rise of Lyric tries to be several types of games at once, it fails to be competent at any one of them. Combat is a repetitive affair of hitting the Y button over and over again until everyone is dead. You can occasionally take the time to dodge attacks, but with the exception of boss fights, that's rarely necessary. Collectible rings are your health, and if you lose all of them, you'll pass out, but that's meaningless because you respawn exactly where you were in whatever battle you were waging, with the enemies' health exactly where you left it. The only punishment for death is losing gear, a currency used to upgrade your characters, but you'll have so much gear that it's less than a slap on the wrist."", ""While the battles are far from interesting, they do occasionally become difficult for all the wrong reasons. Rise of Lyric has not so much of a difficulty curve as a difficulty seismograph that bounces wildly around. You fight the same handful of enemy types for the entire game, but they occasionally come in such numbers or in particularly unbalanced groupings that it's a tiresome slog to wear them all down. I got to the point where rather than fighting enemies, I would simply toss them over cliffs if there was one nearby because it made things go much faster. Many enemies are punch sponges and live long past the point where beating them down is fun."", ""And while combat may be uninspired, it's the closest the game ever comes to reaching competence. Through a combination of unwieldy controls, a broken camera system, and a total lack of responsiveness, the platforming and exploration elements of Rise of Lyric are totally unworkable. Sonic and his buddies control like they've just gotten back from a serious Friday night binge at the local watering hole, swerving back and forth like tipsy sailors. The simple act of consistently walking in a straight line becomes an impossibility. The precision platforming segments are relatively basic matters of timing, but I fell to my death more times than I can count simply due to sloppy and unresponsive controls."", ""The sluggish mechanics even manage to break the one area that is Sonic's bread and butter: the high velocity speed runs. On several occasions, you're dropped on a pre-determined track and sent running at top speed. You dodge and jump over obstacles and collect rings and crowns, and at no point do you feel like you're in total control of your character. The frame rate chugs to unacceptable levels and you simply can't move with the precision you need to consistently land on the tiny spaces the game leaves for you to survive unscathed."", ""The environments of the game have a promising start, with a trip to a dilapidated magitek factory. But before long, they devolve into the typical platforming-adventure cliches. Even the areas with a hint of unique spirit feel tired by the end because of re-used environmental assets and the use of the same three types of puzzles throughout the game. I hope you're a fan of stepping on conveniently lit blocks over and over again, because you'll be seeing seeing that puzzle a lot."", ""Sonic's world is more bug-ridden than the tunnel from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. Sound effects fail to load at the proper cue about a third of the time. Characters occasionally enter cutscenes floating in the air. I clipped through a number of environments. One time, I died and respawned in an area where the game failed to unlock a door I had already opened and I had to reload my game (and redo an entire lengthy level). The game also completely crashed my Wii U, forcing a hard restart of my system and, once again, the repetition of a good 30 minutes of the game."", ""The only area where the game ever shines is in its sense of scale. Players are dropped into massive levels, and the game conveys scale through camera perspectives that capture faraway, unexplored environments. I often realized that I hadn't fully explored some environments after spotting new trails from afar. The only time this scale becomes a problem is in the mandatory beach level, because it is quite large and lacks adequate visual cues to guide you on your way. The only other notable success is the use of Fullmetal Alchemist's Travis Willingham, who makes a great and strangely self-aware Knuckles."", ""Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric is a failure at some basic levels of gaming. While it's understandable that a franchise may want to move beyond the simple elegance of its origins, a muddled web of poorly connected and even more poorly executed systems is not the answer. The Sonic name deserves better than this, and so do consumers.""]"Mark Walton,11-Nov-14,Assassin's Creed Unity Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/assassin-s-creed-unity-review/1900-6415948/,7,Xbox One & PS4,"[""But where else could the series have gone? Its complex Abstergo storyline has long since jumped the shark, leaving more recent entries in the series to wade through the mess and attempt to find some coherency. Unity ties itself into the wider Assassin's Creed universe, but does so only briefly and rather apathetically compared to its predecessors. Its opening--a trailer for Helix, a commercialised version of the Animus intended for entertainment purposes--might suggest otherwise, but if you were hoping for a deeper dive into the muddled mysteries of Abstergo, you won't find it here."", 'This isn\'t so much of a problem if, like me, you found the Abstergo stuff to be a distraction anyway; it\'s nice to be able to focus on the historical narrative without too many jarring interruptions from the ""real world."" This does mean that the historical narrative had better be a great one, but Unity\'s doesn\'t quite meet the mark. Arno is certainly one of the most charismatic and well-acted Assassin\'s Creed leads I\'ve seen--cocksure, mischievous, and just enough of a jerk to still be lovable--but the story never exploits his charms to the fullest.', ""It certainly tries, though. Unity shies away from having a vast collection of ancillary characters, focusing instead upon its lead Arno and his love interest Elise. With fewer of those secondary characters around, many of which tended to play a more lighthearted role, the story is much darker in tone than anything else in the series. It evolves from love story, to revenge tale, to murder mystery, and then circles right back to love story again, all at a heartier pace than one might expect from an Assassin's Creed game."", ""So it's hard to get bored, or at least hard to be indifferent to Unity's story. But, given the singular focus, that all-important chemistry between its two leads just isn't strong enough to tie the whole thing together; I cared enough to want to see things through to end, but not enough to be truly moved by any of its events. It doesn't help that the story is filled with all manner of cliched conversations of deceit, and betrayal, and gibberish about honour. This might be par for the course in Assassin's Creed, but given the effort to reign in the sprawl, it'd have been nice to see the same effort extended to adding more variety to the dialogue--and I don't think we need to see yet another Assassin's Creed start with the death of a family member."", ""Similarly disappointing is how little the story ties into its setting, particularly since Unity's portrayal of a Paris scarred by the civil unrest of the French revolution is one of its greatest triumphs. The attention to detail that's gone into the city is nothing short of astonishing. As the story progresses, the city crumbles before your eyes, the streets becoming awash with citizens burning effigies and waving flags in protest, while loyalists and revolutionaries battle over the future of their homeland."", ""The benefit of Unity's exclusivity to the latest generation of consoles isn't immediately obvious, particularly if you're focused on face-value aesthetics, which look only slightly more impressive here than they did in Black Flag. It's only when you explore Paris' many districts do you realise that the sheer scale of the city is incredible, not only in terms of its explorable limits, but in the huge number of citizens wandering its streets. A mission where you're tasked with performing an assassination amongst a crowd of thousands shows how Unity is as close as the series has ever come to creating a tangible, convincing city."", ""But Unity's story and its single-player missions do little more than skim over some of the finer points of the French revolution and the struggling Parisians, the setting serving as an extravagant backdrop to Arno and Elise's private shenanigans. Part of the joy of Assassin's Creed has always been in how it explores and toys with history, and--despite the benefits of an increased pace--that's sadly been lost here. Where Unity's more progressive elements succeed (and indeed, where most Assassin's Creed games rarely falter), is in its combat and its missions. There Unity's stripped-back approach has resulted in a wonderfully freeform and satisfying stealth experience."", ""Where you'd previously have to complete a mission in a certain way--poisoning a drink, or sneaking in through a certain entrance--Unity leaves those decisions up to you. You're still given hints about what to do, with Arno scanning the area for potential infiltration points and eavesdropping on exploitable civilians--but you can choose to completely ignore them and forge your own path. In one mission I had the option of setting some prisoners free from a jail cell as a distraction to get me into the building. I chose to ignore that completely, and attempt to sneak in via the roof, where snipers mercilessly gunned me down."", ""No, not every plan is going be a rousing success, but the fact that you're given the freedom to choose is far better than the enforced hand-holding of old. I also quite like the trial and error approach, planning out the perfect assassination route after multiple attempts. Indeed, after a few tries, I had that roof approach licked, jumping into the building through an open window and blending into a crowd of bourgeois loyalists before sneaking up on my target and making the kill. With multiple options of attack available, the replayability factor here is huge, giving you more of an incentive to go back and nail those bonus conditions for completing a mission."", ""These excellent sandbox-style assassinations make up the bulk of Unity's missions, but there are sadly still times when you have to stealthily tail a target, only to have to start over if you put a single foot wrong and get spotted: it's time to put these pointlessly frustrating missions to bed. Thankfully, Unity's new co-op missions eschew these dated ideas, and are largely based on large-scale sandbox assassinations. Most fun are the heist missions, where your team is rewarded for stealth: the more people you alert along the way, the less cash you get at the end. It means that every member of the team has to work together efficiently and precisely, without any forced fail states outside of everyone on the team dying."", ""The ability to highlight potential kills for your teammates, as well as unlock skills like shared eagle vision, do a great job of reinforcing this idea of teamwork. The most successful and entertaining heists come from putting together a varied team, with some members focusing on close-range attacks, and others taking point with long-range weapons and sniping any stray enemies. The co-op is a nice addition then, if not the go-to multiplayer mode you might have hoped for. Integrating the co-op into the single-player campaign (with new missions opening up as you progress) is a neat idea, and it makes for more cohesive ties into the storyline. But it also means that the co-op is a mere sideline to the action, rather than something you'd want to plough a lot of time and effort into. Sadly, the excellent competitive multiplayer from previous games doesn't make a return."", ""Outside of the main missions, well, it's fetch quest central for the most part, along with a few assassinations. The excellent stealth mechanics make these missions more exciting than they have any right to be, though, particularly thanks to a few new tweaks that solve some age-old problems. Breaking line of sight with an enemy now creates a visible silhouette of your last known position, which makes it easier to know exactly where you've been spotted, and which areas to avoid. It also works rather well as a lure. Enemies often investigate your last known position, and if that happens to be right by a ledge or a behind a doorway, it makes for an easy assassination. The parkour system has been tweaked, allowing for greater freedom of movement. It means you aren't locked into a set course during a climb, so you can easily move diagonally across a surface, or descend with fewer awkward animations. Arno's new phantom blade ensures you always have access to a silent, long-range weapon, opening up new avenues of assassination that would otherwise have been closed to those who didn't opt to hone Arno's skills in projectile weaponry."", ""Speaking of weaponry, gone are the complex crafting systems of old, replaced with a far friendlier cash system: complete missions, get cash, buy and upgrade weapons and armour. This simplicity is good, because there's a dizzying amount of stuff you can buy, all of which has some sort of effect on Arno's skills. For example, certain hoods extend the range of your eagle vision, while certain pants increase your stealth abilities. The chest, forearms, waist, head, and legs can all be customised to your liking, giving you noticeable boosts across melee, stealth, health, and ranged attacks, as well as a unique look if you opt to tweak the colours."", ""Annoyingly, some of the content is locked out unless you take part in the web-based Assassin's Creed: Initiates, while there are also certain chests in Paris that you can't open unless you unlock them via the Assassin's Creed Companion App. I'm all for giving people the option to extend the experience onto mobiles and tablets, or on the web, but those things should offer standalone extra content; locking stuff out of a game you've just dropped $60 on is infuriating. And it's not like that companion app is any fun either. Dull puzzle games and Top Trumps-like Nomad missions do not make for an exciting second-screen experience."", ""There are other irritations too: clipping issues, NPCs randomly walking in midair, and unstable frame rate during busier scenes all do their bit to suck you out of the moment, but at least none of these glitches were game-breaking. The new, freer parkour did cause a few problems though. For the most part, the freedom to scale and descend buildings at more subtle angles makes the parkour much smoother, but it also makes it far too easy to jump to the wrong part of a building, or scale down the wrong section of wall and straight into the path of an enemy. The enhanced parkour is great when it works, and immensely frustrating when it doesn't."", ""Also, despite whatever canonical reasons Ubisoft gives, it's really weird to wander around revolutionary Paris and have every conversation play out in a thick British accent. And not just your stereotypical typical toff accent either. They're all here: the street urchin, the cockney, and the West Country farmer. Playing Unity is just like taking a tour of Britain, only, you know, in France."", ""Not all of Unity's more progressive touches are for the best then, but you might spend more time noticing what's old than what's new. The terrific city atmosphere of Paris, the focus on parkour, and the incentives for performing stealthy assassinations, all these things hint at a game that's trying to return to its roots after branching out so wildly in its past two iterations. Yes, Unity is the most ACII-like of the series since, well, ACII, and while it never really hits the dizzying heights of Ezio's jaunt through 15th century Italy, Unity's similarities are comforting enough to take the edge off its less-than-successful changes."", ""But is it the next-gen Assassin's Creed game we've all been waiting for? Not quite. It's very good, maybe even great in places, but the story's smaller focus has come at the expense of its exquisitely rendered backdrop. The grandness and spectacle that so often graces the finest Assassin's Creeds is sadly sorely lacking here."", ' ']"Kevin VanOrd,11-Nov-14,Dragon Age: Inquisition Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-inquisition-review/1900-6415949/,9,PS4 & Xbox One,"['Just as Jesus of Nazareth was asked to answer to claims of his divinity, so too does Dragon Age: Inquisition ask you to respond to rumors of your own godhood. As the game opens, you tumble from a rift in the sky, from which onlookers also see a glimpse of a woman. Many believe that the woman must be Andraste, the prophet whose doctrine inspired the rise of the Chantry, yet you have no memory of the event. Perhaps you are a chosen one; perhaps you are merely fortunate. The Maker may know, but His voice continues to go unheard, at least directly; it is up to you, and those you influence, to decide whether you have been marked by a deity. And just as with real-life matters of faith, there is not always a clear resolution.', 'Dragon Age: Inquisition does not draw subtle parallels between the Chantry and modern-day Christianity. Its references are obvious and sometimes heavy-handed, but clear allegory aside, this vast and engrossing role-playing game effectively explores matters of faith and devotion on an intimate level, surrounding you with a multitude of people, each of whom navigates evolving religious turmoil in his or her own way. The chaos of the world you are thrust into explores the usual Dragon Age themes--the struggle between mages and templars, the role of the Grey Wardens in holding off demonic blights, and the political machinations of the Orlesian elite among them. But the Chantry takes a central role, and the ways in which the dialogue and gameplay decisions allow you to express your own views of faith make Inquisition the most personal game in the series, which is a wonderful revelation given how much real estate it depicts.', ' ', ""It is from tragedy and chaos that the Inquisition is reborn, and it is only appropriate that a fledgling movement appoint a fledgling leader--you--as its head. You tailor your Inquisitor in all sorts of wonderful ways using the game's intricate character creation system; you may even choose from a couple of different voices, even though the character is fully acted. You can also create a Qunari protagonist for the first time in the series, though you needn't mourn the options you didn't choose should you prefer a Dalish elf: your available party members, three of whom can join you at any given time, are a diverse group, and include Iron Bull, a no-nonsense, laid-back Qunari warrior who avoids becoming the gruff, gravelly-voiced stereotype he could so easily have been."", ""In fact, Dragon Age: Inquisition's characters typically avoid the cliches we've come to know in video games (and in fiction in general), which is much of what makes getting to know them, even returning ones, such a pleasure. Cassandra is primarily known for her interrogation of Varric, that dwarven teller of tall of tall tales, in Dragon Age II; in Inquisition, her stubbornness takes a beautifully human shape. She is driven not by power, but by law, and as she examines her faith during a time of upheaval, her questioning is poignant. That she believes is her most admirable trait, though it's this same trait that has her frequently confronting Varric with such aggression. Hearing the two bicker as they follow you across verdant meadows and through dim caverns is one of Inquisition's highlights."", 'The ways in which the dialogue and gameplay decisions allow you to express your own views of faith make Inquisition the most personal game in the series.', ""Of course, keeping these two in your party means leaving others behind, and it's hard not to miss Varric's hairy chest, which is almost a character unto itself. I grew to appreciate a mysterious spirit named Cole most of all, not just because of his talent with dual daggers, but for his overwhelming compassion for others. He reads minds, often communicating the thoughts and emotions he uncovers in a stream-of-consciousness poetry, fragmented and alliterative. Cole comforts people in need, but wipes memories of him from their minds, in a touching show of selflessness."", ""Dragon Age: Inquisition treats its characters with great respect; Iron Bull's description of sex among the Qunari is as honest as his admiration of a transgender mercenary is honorable. Your choices when speaking to your cohorts, as well as when adventuring, meet with their disapproval or approval, sometimes even when the character in question isn't there to witness the event. (It's odd to be immediately notified that Varric appreciates how you have destroyed a deposit of the dangerous mineral red lyrium even when he isn't at your side when it occurs.) Romance might ensue, presuming you earn the favor of the character you most fancy, though there is always the chance of a broken heart. As is the case with most BioWare games, many previous choices are inescapable; encouraging my lover to make the world a better place ultimately led to our split. In that moment, I recalled losing Alastair to a greater cause in Dragon Age: Origins; how appropriate that the best experiences in the series thus far would be similarly tinged with sorrow."", ""It is through dialogue choices and forking gameplay options that you become the Inquisitor you wish to be. You even sit upon your throne and cast judgment on those that wronged you--and then deal with the repercussions when certain people and factions don't like your choices. You might sentence a renegade mage to tranquility, only to face negativity from magical forces that fear your wrath--or, if you are a mage, see you as a hypocrite. Some of these choices play out on the war table, which you view along with your Inquisition allies from overhead. Here, you select missions that might reward you with influence and power, or earn you metals and herbs to use for crafting new armor and weapons, or for outfitting your base of operations with new decor. Once a mission is selected, you select an approach--usually diplomatic, surreptitious, or forceful--and then wait for word to come back and rewards to flow in. This is Dragon Age's answer to Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood: you assign tasks to your allies, and they return, hopefully, with news of good fortune."", ' ', 'Your choices from previous games are reflected as well, though if you\'ve decided to move to a new platform, you can visit the game\'s official website and tailor the world in advance. Some references to those choices are entirely too conspicuous, as if to scream ""Hey, remember that thing you did? Do you?"" Fortunately, not every contextual detour is so blatant. Your race and class are frequently noted in passing, and they are reflected in how people speak to you and react to your presence. As a Dalish elf, the idea that I could truly be The Herald of Andraste (the Christlike title I was granted) was blasphemy among many; as a mage, the Templars did not greet me with enthusiasm. At one stage, I was invited to hobnob with the Orlesian elite, a suspicious crowd that grew even more suspicious in my elven presence.', ""The mission that puts you face to face with the nobility of Orlais, as well as with the disturbing masks they donned, is somewhat of a slog--a lot of walking and talking and listening, but rather little in the way of epiphany. It's also an important one, in that it portrays the diplomatic aspect of the Inquisitor's role in this world. You are a spy, an ambassador, and a combatant, and this thematic diversity is reflected in the gameplay. You are also an explorer, spending most of your time traversing Dragon Age: Inquisition's expansive spaces. You move through the meadows, deserts, and stormy coasts from a third-person perspective, uncovering new areas, unlocking new camps for resting, and, of course, crushing the apostates, great bears, and wyverns that dare taunt you."", 'It is through dialogue choices and forking gameplay options that you become the Inquisitor you wish to be.', ""Combat is likely to be Dragon Age: Inquisition's most divisive feature. It is fun and colorful, and if you bemoaned the loss of the tactical camera in Dragon Age II, you'll be glad to know it is back, and available even on consoles, allowing you to direct the action from above. The tactical camera can be awkward, getting caught up on objects and sticking a bit too close to the action. On the other, the ability on consoles to use a single button to forward time instead of constantly pausing and unpausing is an intuitive tweak. But unless you're fighting roaring dragons or imposing bosses, you probably won't need the tactical camera very often, should you play on medium difficulty. Instead, you perform your standard attack, which costs no stamina, while throwing in more powerful abilities for dealing additional damage and controlling crowds."", ""In the meanwhile, your companions perform adequately enough; you can somewhat customize their AI routines as you could in previous games, but there's little need for micromanagement in this way. Most healing magic is gone, so you rely on health potions that replenish in camps and towns, and most tactical considerations, like throwing bombs and drinking draughts, can be dealt with from the default point of view. Ultimately, it's a good system that works well in both wide open spaces and cramped caves, and Inquisition is certainly the most fluid of the Dragon Age games. There are challenges out there, but nail-biting battles aren't common, though hard mode is always there if you want one, and dragon battles demand your concentration regardless."", ""Certain key boss battles aren't a comfortable fit; boss attack patterns sometimes require immediate reactions, but party members in the midst of combat don't respond until the current action is complete, at which point it might be too late to avoid damage. These occasions are the exception, however, and not the rule, and easy or not, there's no doubting the action's diversity. Because you can directly control the Inquisitor as well as any party member, there's never a need to stick with magic, or a two-handed blade, if you prefer to inhabit Varric's shoes and shoot his prized bow Bianca for a while."", ' ', 'Journeying is an absolute delight. You discover astralariums that hone in on constellations, requiring you to perform a connect-the-stars minigame to reveal the myth behind them. You peer through contraptions that allow you to survey the landscape and identify shimmering shards, which you then may collect. Such activities initially come across as busywork, only to be revealed as keys to new dungeons and temples. Meanwhile, your work at the war table often results in new areas being revealed, and previously accessible areas opening to you. And so you blindly venture into a new cavern, which might hold spiders, phantasms seeking respite, or puzzles that lead to even greater mysteries. There are decisions to make in the field, as well. I chose to betray my legacy and pursue untold magical knowledge, only to offer that knowledge to another when I feared the potential negative repercussions. There are paths I look back on with wonder and regret. What if I had gained the ancient ally I had forsaken? What if I had abandoned my selfish quest for wisdom and instead paid no mind to the power-hungry mage bending my ear?', ""And so a world builds around you. You blow a horn that sounds out across the land, signaling to your comrades that a fortification is cleared of enemies and theirs to inhabit. You find notes and read books, and they build a narrative picture remarkably consistent with the game's sights and sounds. In Dragon Age: Inquisition, gameplay and story are not separate objects, but inextricable entities. The story you create in your mind by the very act of adventuring, and the one BioWare tells by way of its events and characters, have equal footing. Dragon Age: Inquisition separates its expansive regions and makes them accessible on its world map; it is not one massive space, as an Elder Scrolls game would be. But it feels no less impressive for it, nor does the storytelling suffer from the sheer size of the world and the sheer amount of content. These elements form a large, coherent, self-consistent picture."", ' ', ""This enormous and attractive picture reveals blemishes should you look closely enough. Rare sound bugs, awkward jumping puzzles, characters that pop into view, awkward cutscene transitions, and weird clipping might briefly distract you, but their sum total amounts to little. 85 hours after I started Dragon Age: Inquisition, the story reached a conclusion, and yet I still stare at all the areas still dark on the map. You can customize the keep that serves as your base of operations, and I look at the list of related unlockables, most of which still remain inaccessible. I wonder about Vivienne, the haughty mage that joined my cause, yet whom I barely know. I look at the small list of potions I have unlocked, and get anxious, wanting to rush into the Hinterlands or the Storm Coast, hoping to find plans for more. I ponder these schools of combat I have been told of, and the quests that (I think) will add them to my party's repertoire upon completion. I long to see and do all that I missed, not because it's there--but because I am confident it's worth seeing and doing."", 'You spend several of those hours at the crafting tables, creating and enhancing armor and weapons using the metals and herbs you collect along the way. If there\'s anything that slows down exploration, it\'s the frequent searching and collection of elfroot and serpentstone. You don\'t actively spend skill points in core attributes like constitution and ability, but you can still affect them when constructing gear for you and your cohorts. I miss Dragon Age: Origins\' Sandal, the lovable lug all too eager to enhance your armor with a simple call of ""Enchantment?"" But the system he services didn\'t go as deep as Inquisition\'s, which had me carefully hoarding the rarest resources so that I might use them wisely. That spark-spewing dragon wasn\'t going to die a natural death, after all.', ' ', ""You might also spend a few hours in Dragon Age: Inquisition's cooperative multiplayer mode, which recalls that of Mass Effect 3, in that you have access only to a few different archetypes, and gradually earn more characters, more skills, and more items to boost you and your teammates in battle. (Of course, you can also purchase loot caches if you wish to hurry the process. It wouldn't be a modern big-budget game without a raft of microtransactions.) Matches are straightforward sojourns through three different maps focused exclusively on eliminating enemies, and while the enemies may differ, the pace is straightforward. Mass Effect 3 garnered a dedicated online following; Dragon Age: Inquisition's moment-to-moment gameplay doesn't have the same immediacy and spark, making it a fine bit of light entertainment, but unlikely to inspire the same devotion."", ""Inquisition's characters and world, on the other hand, recall the grand gestures of the original Dragon Age, even though the game as a whole is so structurally different to its predecessors. It offers the thrill of discovery and the passion of camaraderie. It features a glee club called The Sing-Quisition, and a dwarf with writer's block. It establishes connections with its world in big ways and small, with the sight of a titanous temple and the smirk of an Orlesian commander in love. Dragon Age: Inquisition is a wonderful game and a lengthy pilgrimage to a magical world with vital thematic ties to one we already know.""]"John Robertson,10-Nov-14,Pro Evolution Soccer 2015 Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/pro-evolution-soccer-2015-review/1900-6415944/,8,PS4,"[""It's the same question every year: which is better, PES or FIFA? For the last five years, or thereabouts, the answer has been near-unanimously FIFA, with its greater depth and sophistication trumping the comparatively shallow game coming from Konami's camp. That wasn't always the case, of course. PES' PlayStation 2 heyday was so glorious that it has long held a sentimental place in the hearts of those that were there to experience first hand the suspect penalties, expertly crafted runs, and the agony of defeat at a stoppage time goal."", 'Sadly, most of those players migrated to FIFA, thanks to the quality of the football on offer being, quite simply, superior. Wonderful it is, then, that the PES vs. FIFA question is once again one worth raising without a hint of satire or cynicism. PES 2015 is not only the best game the series has delivered for many years, it promotes and prioritises a form of football that is, welcomingly, very different to that of FIFA 15--and variety across games is never a bad thing.', ""PES promotes a tactical and technical approach to football. If FIFA 15 is the embodiment of the Premier League, all action, speed, and ferocity, then PES 15 is the Spanish La Liga, more considered, subtle and delicate. Success is less about bursting through the midfield and delivering a killer through ball to your striker, and more about using the ball's movement to disrupt the opposition's shape, and create space for your teammates to work in. As such, it pays to have a basic understanding of how different formations create unique passing lanes, and set up situations in which you outnumber the other team in certain areas of the pitch."", ""Not that you need to have the footballing brain of Jose Mourinho to succeed, but some degree of knowledge is of undeniable benefit. Primarily, it's the quality of the defensive players that makes life difficult; the AI, especially on higher difficulties, is very adept at positioning itself in a way that limits your options. This applies not only to the defenders themselves, but also to midfielders that drop deeper when their team is without the ball. That means quickly getting used to attacking two disciplined lines of defenders, making it essential that you retain possession long enough to make an impact."", ""This makes PES 2015 a slower brand of football, which, predictably, results in fewer goals being scored in matches. This can be frustrating, especially if you're playing in a league or cup competition and consistently find that games are ending 0-0 or 1-0. Raising the match time from the default 10-minutes to 15-minutes helps immensely in this regard. Not only does this give you more time to score, but it allows you to express yourself calmly and methodically; there's far less panicking and resorting to hopeful shots from 35 yards, or forever pinging the ball to Ronaldo, Messi or whichever star you happen to have (if any)."", ""Giving possession to Ballon D'Or contenders such as these can still work wonders, though. While the core of the game this year is about using space efficiently, the top players still perform like top players. The difference is that you have to make better use of their entire suite of abilities. Simply dribbling or pulling off long strings of tricks doesn't lead to many goal scoring opportunities, the feints and spins linked to the right stick not acting as some kind of magic wand with which to win games. Using your best players as a pivot around which the rest of your team flows is fine, but success doesn't come from the ability of an individual."", ""PES used to be perfect for those late, hazy nights where everyone is a little too jolly and looking for something simple to play. That isn't the case anymore. While not entirely inaccessible--lower difficulty settings remain terribly easy--PES does require more concentration than the vast majority of football games past and present; it's not a party game."", 'Further highlighting the idea that PES is aimed more at football nerds than casual fans are the included game modes, with the official licenses for the UEFA Champions League, Copa Libertadores, Asian Champions Leaguem, and various minor league competitions present. This is not a game for those only interested in Real Madrid vs. Barcelona, or Arsenal vs. Chelsea; this is a game set on trying to represent football as it exists around the world.', ""The contradiction to that, of course, comes the fact that huge swathes of official licenses are missing. While this doesn't negatively impact the gameplay, it does dampen the overarching levels of excitement and charm. Manchester Utd, for instance, are the only officially licensed team from the Premier League. They're joined by the likes of Merseyside Red (Liverpool), London FC (Chelsea) and West Midlands Village (Aston Villa)."", 'All of the players have the correct names and, in most cases, accurately modeled faces, but playing with a licensed team versus an unlicensed team disrupts your suspension of disbelief. Most destructive is the complete absence of the German Bundesliga, with Bayern Munich, Bayer Leverkusen and Schalke unceremoniously included in the Other European Teams category. Borussia Dortmund are not here at all, with the likes of Marco Reus showing up only in the German national team.', ""The Master League career mode remains the primary time sink for single-player games, although it will be interesting to see how well the Ultimate Team-like myClub performs after a couple of months of play, and whether it even comes close to becoming the go-to option. More interesting than those, though, is the Role Control idea, which can be optionally assigned to a multiplayer game. This allows players on the same team to take control of entire defensive, midfield, or attacking units, rather than randomly switch to whichever player is closest to the ball. The result is a greater sense of involvement in the bigger picture; the fact that you're in control of a specific group allows you to work with your co-op partner in a much more meaningful and controlled manner. You still control only one player at a time, but only those that are part of your unit. It's an idea all football games should include."", 'Other details work less well. Menus remain ugly and dull, which is a problem that this series has never properly addressed, with predictable grey boxes and boorish black text doing little to get you excited or engaged. English commentary is similarly sleep-inducing, comprised mainly of reeling off player names and repeating the same descriptions of actions that you heard in previous matches. In keeping with the lack of licenses, the frills and accessories adorning the core game are workmanlike at best.', ""The answer, then: FIFA or PES? If you're looking for something fast-paced, exciting and guaranteed to give you goals, then FIFA is for you. If you're looking to delve more deeply into passing, movement and working out how to break teams down, plump for PES. If football games are the only thing you play, it's worth owning both in a bid to satisfy every mood. Most importantly, though, is knowing that PES 2015 is not inferior to FIFA 15. That in itself represents a huge step forward for a series that, for a time, looked as though it had no chance whatsoever of getting back to digital football's elite table.""]"Justin Clark,6-Nov-14,The Unfinished Swan Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-unfinished-swan-review/1900-6415945/,8,PS4,"[""The Unfinished Swan starts with a kind, grandmotherly voice telling the story of Monroe, a newly orphaned young man, whose mother has just passed away, leaving him orphaned, leaving him nothing but her last, unfinished painting of a swan. Soon after, the disembodied bird flaps off into the blank white nothingness of the painting, and Monroe follows. The storybook narration ends, the screen fades to white, and you're left with one of the most exhilarating moments in all of gaming."", ""You're left with nothing."", 'The screen fades to completely empty white space, with a tiny circle reticule in the center. You hit one of the triggers or the touchpad, and Monroe throws an ink pellet, making his first haphazard black splotch on the world, and highlighting the way forward.', ' ', ""What follows is a first person game unlike anything else: An abstract, Jackson Pollock work of art of the player's making, where objects only take shape after you've splashed black paint all over the canvas, giving shape to each object, making the objects and paths stand out by contrast with the paint alone. The world of The Unfinished Swan, in this first chapter, is a world of blank castles, paths, park benches, shallow ponds, blank statues, and rusty, creaking gates, all of which exist, and yet don't exist, until Monroe makes his mark. It's an elegant, soothing aesthetic, giving the player all sorts of leeway to play and make things messy, while still creating something pleasing to the eye. After traversing the landscape awhile, you reach higher ground and are able to look back over your creation. This sight might be one of the most transcendent, fascinating moments in any game, seeing black and white spatters form shapes, animals, architecture, and natural beauty. That unexpected beauty, unfortunately, only makes the fact that the game starts filling in the blank space with color and shadow in the next three chapters all the more disappointing."", ""This was the issue with The Unfinished Swan in 2012, and it's not an issue that the pretty 60 frames-per-second, 1080p upgrade could ever fix. Yet, knowing what the PS4 is capable of, it's still a bit of a crestfall. That's not to say that what comes after the first chapter is bad, per se. On the contrary, taken as a separate, simple tale of a boy exploring the vast sterile wonderland of his parents' imaginations, it's still a playful exercise in curiosity and exploration. It's one of the most thoughtful and endearing uses of the first person perspective in quite some time, bolstered by a quirky, gentle electronic ambient score, and a soft, melancholy subtext of divorce and the death of loved ones."", ""The storybook narration ends, the screen fades to white, and you're left with one of the most exhilarating moments in all of gaming."", ""Because the game is so very short--about two or three hours long--no one stage lasts long enough to wear out its conceptual welcome. The game ushers you in pursuit of the titular swan, through vast, Draconian labyrinths, wide, open, Mediterranean plazas, hot air balloon platforms, twisting vines that grow and stretch in whatever direction you toss water balloons, and spooky adventures in shadowed forests, lit by the light of strange luminescent fruit. Embedded in that stage is the one section in which the game comes close to the first chapter's brilliance: a section in which Monroe jumps into a painting, and finds himself in a Cubist rendition of the current area, where he can use his ink/water pellets to create geometric shapes and platforms. It's there and gone as fast as it came, but it's still a joyous change of pace at a point in the game where it's most needed. And in between, the story is still told, through new pages of the story revealed by splashing ink on golden letters, telling fun, simple tales of the king who once ruled the empty lands, and his troubles. And yet, even then, where the game goes is not nearly as powerful a statement on artistry and imagination as where it starts. What was once snowblind exploration turns into simple problems and puzzles of physics."", ""While the game that follows is a satisfyingly twee Golden Book of a game, the first chapter lets the player's imagination do the heavy lifting in a way games never do. The ink only provides a rudimentary outline for your world, and any sense of the overarching land comes entirely from within. It's euphoric, that power. It stretches muscles that games don't allow unless you're playing a text adventure. Once the game starts filling in the blanks for you, giving the buildings shadows and color and concrete shapes, those muscles are laid to rest for the rest of the game. No matter how much the game's inherent playfulness and imagination is being flirted with, no matter how pleasant the narration is, especially when Terry Gilliam--yes, that Terry Gilliam--shows up for a late game cameo, the fact is that what was once abstract, existing predominantly in the player's mind, is now being made solid by someone else."", ""That fact strips it of a groundbreaking ambition that the gaming world needs so much more of. The Unfinished Swan presented in Chapter One could've sustained a few hours by itself. Instead, it takes up only half an hour, followed by another few hours that settle for being simply great and delightful. It's the kind of failure many developers work their fingers to the bone to achieve.""]"Cameron Woolsey,5-Nov-14,Depth Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/depth-review/1900-6415941/,5,PC,"['It would be difficult to go into great length about Depth without mentioning the game it clearly aspires to be. The game draws much of its influence from Left 4 Dead and other titles that utilize the time-tested formula of regular heroes versus stronger boss creatures. Depth takes the action below the sea, pitting a team of four treasure-hunting divers and their underwater drone against two great white sharks out for blood. Several hours of gore-filled amusement ensue, though repetition, bugs, and other nagging issues make Depth end up somewhat waterlogged.', ""But a little sogginess won't stop Depth's team of underwater treasure hunters, despite the danger posed by sharks. As a diver, you and your three allies closely follow robot drone S.T.E.V.E. as it sluggishly moves from area to area, pilfering rusted iron safes for loot. There are no safe rooms offering asylum, and no checkpoints to break up rounds; all five available maps are small, and progression only briefly halts in a room or open area containing a safe--it is where your drone collects gold while your team prepares for the inevitable attack."", 'Treasure found scattered in the environment provides cash to trade for weapons and gear for your team to use in defense. You can toss flares for additional light, or place sonar buoys that highlight incoming threats. But sometimes you can make a bigger statement by planting sea mines to blow attacking sharks into fish sticks. Weapons consist of amphibious rifles and pistols, as well as an assortment of spear guns. You can also fill a weapon slot with other tools such as the DPV (diver propulsion vehicle), which scans for nearby treasure and caches of ammo as it provides a welcome boost in speed, or a net gun that temporarily binds sharks in place.', ""But it's not just the sharks divers have to watch out for; there are plenty of glitches eager to join the fight. Clipping through objects is common, and nothing rips you out of the experience like a large hunk of metal taking up the screen. Treasure also has a nasty habit of clipping through mounds of sediment, buried just deep enough to be out of reach. Even more irritating are computer-controlled sharks that have a bad habit of occasionally clipping through solid walls. Tapping sprint propels you forward in short bursts, though you can only use this ability consecutively about three times, after which you have to wait for a brief period--this must be due to fatigue, but the HUD for the diver doesn't include a stamina meter to display how much energy you can deplete before tiring. Boosts also stop short far too often, freezing you in place even as you hold forward. Getting stuck on walls and other objects is another constant source of annoyance. And to be killed by a shark after getting snagged by a corner or a frayed piece of metal is incredibly frustrating."", ""The other team consists of two speedy sharks, each armed with razor-sharp teeth. Unlike divers, who have the benefit of firepower, playing as a shark means having to use guerilla tactics to plan moves and strike when the moment is right. Attacks are limited to a short lunge and a long dash, and any living thing caught in their jaws is destined to have a bad day. Their attacks are limited to a short lunge and a long dash, and any living thing caught in their jaws is destined to have a bad day. Of course, you will have to suspend some disbelief, as Depth's sharks are able to stop and float in place, as well as swim backwards--both of which are physically impossible for sharks (I don't care what you saw in Deep Blue Sea). Parts of the environment indicated by glowing cracks can be destroyed by ramming into them, creating new openings and opportunities in which to plot your attack; I only wish there was some indication as to how much damage these objects can take, as some will crumble at two hits, others three. More than once I thought a wall would give way after three hits, only to watch as my second strike left me floating in a room looking foolish and surrounded by trigger-happy divers."", 'Playing in third-person as a shark is more difficult than playing as a diver, but practice yields deliciously grisly rewards. As your skills sharpen, it becomes easier to sense the best time to pick a diver out of a room before the other flippered meat-bags figure out what happened. Stalking your prey and setting up an ambush at the opening of a passageway, or diving down on unsuspecting enemies, is absolutely thrilling. Damaging S.T.E.V.E. temporarily stops the drone, giving you time chase down seals to replenish health, or regroup and plan the next attack. Special abilities can be purchased as you rack up kills. Boosting the strength of your ampullae of Lorenzini, for example, allows you detect the kind of equipment the divers are using, and the hammerhead skill can bust down destructible environments faster and put S.T.E.V.E. out of commission for a longer stretch of time.', ""Playing as a shark is just as buggy as a diver, though. It's all too easy to get stuck on corners or objects just as frequently as a diver, if not more so, while aiming the shark is incredibly unintuitive. Often you zip past a diver just barely out of your reach, leaving you to guess where best to direct those gnashing jaws."", ""Depth's distractions are unfortunate, because when the game is running at full performance, it hits all the right emotional notes: The sense of imposing dread as a fleshy diver, and the excitement of the hunt as a bloodthirsty shark. As a diver, your first indication of the growing danger is your heart, which beats harder as a shark draws near. Huddling in a corner, the faint sound of a tail swishing through the water nearby is enough for panic to unsettle any confidence placed in your defenses. Hearing the muffled scream of an ally as a streak of silver whips past to drag him into the gloomy depths in an eruption of bubbles and blood is terrifying, and more than enough to justify any level of galeophobia. Thankfully, the shooting mechanics are solid, and a wide variety of weapons and gear allows you to experiment and customize your diver as you see fit. The same can be said for the sharks, whose special abilities grant the freedom to create the predator of your dreams. I actually found myself leaning toward the shark team the more I played. The dominance you feel as you swim into the open sea with your prize in tow after a successful hunt will leave you shaking with maniacal laughter."", ""But sadly it doesn't take long for that pleasure to fade. In its attempt to mimic the mechanics and design of its famous peer, Depth fails to parallel Left 4 Dead's endurance or charm. The maps include a sunken ship and bleak caverns, but many lack features distinguishing enough to make them truly memorable. Complicating the dilemma is how utterly dark most of the maps are. The grim surroundings go far to offer fearful situations in which a shark could attack from the shadows, but going through multiple sections in levels where only a few shafts of light and a part of a wall are visible makes for a drab experience--one that peaks at around eight hours before becoming dull and repetitive. Don't look to the divers to infuse much-needed color, though; any differences between, say, Alejandro and Marissa stops at disparate model types. Depth also looks incredibly dated; its murky water just barely obscures the low-quality textures, and (even running maximum settings for anti-aliasing) sharp, jagged edges that outline the details of character models and objects threaten to slice straight through the screen."", 'The maps also suffer from some balancing issues. Although a couple of levels are fairly even, savoring both open and enclosed areas, others favor one side or the other. Playing as a shark in a map filled with rooms interconnected by narrow passageways is made even more difficult when you get snagged on the myriad corners preventing you from escaping. Another map ends with a long stretch of open water, barely illuminated beyond the scope of the divers\' flashlights. Sonar buoys have a limited range, so creating even a modest guise of security requires that you swim far outside the safety of your team. At that point you might as well hang a sign around your neck that reads ""shark bait.""', ""It's not without some semblance of irony that Depth ends up feeling shallow. But it won't pass without at least demonstrating a working and entertaining idea: sharks-versus-humans has been a theme to which video games have occasionally returned. And so far, Depth is the closest I've come to experiencing the kind of fear a game about killer sharks should generate since my younger days of playing Jaws on the NES. Future updates that clean up bugs and add new content could help it breach the surface and approach greatness. Until then, however, Depth floats listlessly in the ocean current.""]"Josiah Renaudin,3-Nov-14,NBA Live 15 Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/nba-live-15-review/1900-6415942/,5,PS4 & Xbox One,"['EA\'s return to basketball last year felt like a labor of obligation, shabbily patched together and pushed out the door. If this year\'s goal were simply ""make a better game,"" NBA Live 15 checks that box--but that doesn\'t make it a good basketball experience. Shoddy mechanics, simplistic defensive play, and antiquated visuals make it difficult to have fun with NBA Live 15. It\'s not broken, and there\'s enough content to keep you busy for the full NBA season. However, NBA Live is a franchise desperately searching for its identity, and its deficiencies are only more glaring with NBA 2K15 reaching such great heights.', ""If you take a close look at a player in NBA Live 15, you quickly see the technical strides this series has taken. Sweat realistically travels down bodies, which now sport muscles that retract and expand during drives to the basket. Jump shots, post moves, and even Euro steps all look more believable than those in last years game. There's a varying level of detail from player to player, but stars like cover athlete Damian Lillard look sharp, thanks to the motion capture work and 3D head scanning."", ""It can be attractive up close, but NBA Live 15's technical limitations emerge when you pull back the camera and watch it all in motion. Athletes stick awkwardly close to one another on the court, jittering maneuvers and stiff movements pulling you out of the action. The frame rate often fails to keep up when turnovers lead to fastbreak scores, while sudden accelerated animations make it difficult to follow the action. NBA Live 15 isn't ugly, but constant visual wobbles make it feel stuck in a generation gone by."", ""Its unrefined presentation is forgivable, if disappointing. However, NBA Live 15's biggest and most pervasive liability comes in how it feels. Running offensive plays is trying, with much of your ball movement stemming from often-ineffective screens. It's too difficult to create space and find an open shot on your own, so you're left relying too heavily on working around picks in order to push to the rim. Dunks and layups can almost feel automatic if you're guarded by a single defender, but getting into the paint is arduous with efficient dribbling and quick finesse moves being so toothless."", ""Defense isn't smart or fun, as it's just too easy to press against your man and prevent open looks or strong post moves. Instead of guessing the direction of a player's drive, NBA Live 15 allows you to shut down even the biggest stars by simply staying reasonably close. That's it. You need to press your weight against bigger men in the paint and time your jump to contest shots, but defense doesn't offer enough involvement in the on-court battle to actually feel interesting. Attempting steals adds a bit of dynamism, but batting the ball away is too easy. On my first six attempts, I stole the ball five times and drove it down the court for multiple easy baskets. It helped me come away with a win, but that shouldn't happen in a game attempting to simulate the sport."", ""But then, I continually found myself questioning whether or not NBA Live 15 really is trying to provide an authentic basketball experience. The pace is much faster than is often comfortable, with transition plays often feeling more disorienting than advantageous. Simply passing the ball around the key looks and feels a half step faster than you'd expect, and even shooting the ball is a bizarrely inauthentic task. Instead of releasing at the top of your jump, you need to launch the ball a few moments earlier in order to kiss the bottom of the nylon. This forces you to forget what every other basketball game has taught you, but even if you master the timing, it still feels sinful to let go of the button so early."", ""It isn't quite a simulation, but don't think NBA Live 15 reaches NBA Jam levels of absurdity. Players don't catch fire and brush against the ceiling before finishing a dunk, yet player and ball motion just dont feel like theyre based on the real NBA. NBA Live 15 isn't fun and zany enough to be an arcade experience, but it also fails to present the proper shooting, passing, and fundamentals you'd expect in a basketball simulation."", ""Beyond the standard Tip Off mode, NBA Live 15 includes a simplistic create-a-player component called Rising Star. Here, you can fashion your own personal player from the ground up--determining his position, appearance, background, and build. Unfortunately, there's little outside of the upgrade system that makes this feature feel unique. There's no real semblance of a story to make you feel invested in your created player, so your only incentive to push forward is watching your statistics continue to tick up."", ""The rest of the feature set continues to feels like a watered-down version of what NBA 2K15 already provides. Ultimate Team lets you build your dream team through collected cards of varying rarity, while Dynasty allows you to manage the trades, goals, and on-court action of your favorite team. Both are serviceable, but have been done better elsewhere. The Big Moments mode is a little bit more novel, letting you reenact some of the most spectacular nights in a player's career. Stepping into Carmelo Anthony's shoes to recreate his 62-point outburst from last season is a challenge, but attempting to recapture this magic is at least a fun change of pace."", ""Even during its brightest moments, NBA Live 15 isn't a very fun basketball game. Effective offense is a struggle to achieve, and defense is far too automated to keep you interested. Even with individual players looking better up close, NBA Live 15 fails to present an attractive package when all ten bodies are running plays on the court. EA is headed in the right direction with this struggling franchise, but compared to NBA 2K15, Live feels like it's playing for a roster spot in the D-League.""]"Don Saas,3-Nov-14,WWE 2K15 Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wwe-2k15-review/1900-6415940/,4,PS3 & Xbox 360,"['In the midst of a raucous hometown Chicago crowd, the WWE Universe screams my name.', 'CM Punk!

Basic actions like dragging your opponent on the mat cause your superstar to wander back and forth before finally settling on which part of your opponent he wants to grab. Spatial recognition for ground finishers is more finicky than ever, and there is little logic to when you can and can not activate a finishing or signature move. Computer opponents occasionally stand stock still if you're caught in the corner or in an awkward place on the ground, as if they've forgotten how to attack. And countering relies on nearly magical intuition."", ""In terms of new content, WWE 2K15's two raison d'etres are its 2K Showcase and Who Got NXT modes. In 2K Showcase, you explore two of the biggest rivalries of the last 10 years of professional wrestling: CM Punk and John Cena in the early 2010s, and Shawn Michaels and Triple H in the mid-2000s. And in Who Got NXT, you take five up-and-coming wrestlers from the WWE's developmental program through four matches a piece."", ""For longtime wrestling fans, 2K Showcase mode may lack the nostalgia overload of the Attitude Era or the 30 Years of Wrestlemania modes of the last two years, but it's still a thrill to relive classic matches and history-defining moments in the WWE, such as CM Punk winning the WWE Championship at Money in the Bank in 2011 despite his (non-kayfabe) contract expiring an hour after the PPV ended, or Shawn Michaels winning the World Heavyweight Championship in the first ever Elimination Chamber match."", ""And thanks to smart video packages (a WWE specialty), most of these moments are given the context needed to make you care about yet another fight between CM Punk and John Cena in their 19-match campaign. You fight (and control) other wrestlers at times, but the bulk of the action is centered between those two. Throw in ever-changing ring gear that matches whatever each performer wore to that specific match over the years, and there's fan-service galore. However, any match without a video package (and there are quite a few) reeks of filler and the lesser sort of wrestling repetition."", ""Other subtle but important elements of 2K Showcase are mid-match objectives that lead to cutscenes during matches that fill in the most memorable moments, which wouldn't be accurately simulated by the combat engine otherwise (such as Mr. McMahon's interference I mentioned above). For those not familiar with every one of these fights, the scenes add a layer of unpredictability and drama to what would otherwise become just another squash match. It's a cool risk, seeing the objective to hit your opponent with your finisher and not knowing whether you'll succeed or if your opponent will turn the tables on you. Some semblance of this system would be quite welcome outside of the story mode."", ""If 2K Showcase is a celebration of WWE's past, Who Got NXT could have been a celebration of the company's future. Smarks will gladly tell you that NXT regularly puts on a better program than the company's flagship show, Raw, but the utter lack of context for your actions in Who Got NXT, beyond throwaway dialogue from the commentary team, removes the semblance of an arc you're given with 2K Showcase. It's satisfying that the objectives in these matches (which do not reward you with in-match cutscenes) match the personality and style of the wrestler you're controlling, but the mode fails to gel into a substantive whole."", ""Everything else in WWE 2K15 are elements of the series you've seen before except... there's less. After two years of massive rosters filled with classic WWE Legends, 2K15 backslides with just the current Raw/Smackdown rosters and a handful of classic stars unlocked during the Shawn Michaels/HHH feud. The content creation elements of the game are similarly stripped down from years past which is frustrating for fans who have lost dozens of hours creating superstars, finishing moves, costumes, and custom entrances."", ""One of the most touted elements of the PS4/Xbox One releases of the game is the huge leap forward in visuals (as well as a MyCareer mode similar to modes in the other 2K Sports games). The character models in the last-gen versions are a wreck. Paul Heyman looks like a low-res, bloated Steven Seagal; John Cena's eyes look like they're about to burst out of his head; and Shawn Michaels looks like he wandered in out of The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion. Some superstars look fine (Big E, Rusev, Seth Rollins), but I would be unable to guess who most were at first glance, were it not for their ring gear. The game also suffers from a series of audiovisual bugs including but not limited to: delayed and/or non-existent sound on mat collisions, non-existent lip-syncing, wonky shadows if the ring is hit too hard, clipping through the ropes, repeated dialogue by the commentary team during pre-match introductions, and a host of other issues."", ""The one area where WWE 2K15 manages to outshine its predecessors is the color commentary. For the first time, Jerry Lawler and Michael Cole recorded their commentary together for the game, and the stilted and unnatural repartee from past games is finally gone. And while it's weird (and jarringly inconsistent with the game's attempts to get all the little details right) hearing Michael Cole call matches with Jerry Lawler during the Shawn Michaels/HHH rivalry mode, when Jim Ross was doing that job at the time, that anachronism is a small price to pay for commentary that provides necessary context and fun historical tidbits. There were moments where I would stop beating on opponents in 2K Showcase just so I'd know I wasn't going to interrupt what the King and Michael Cole were going to say next."", ""At last month's Hell in a Cell PPV, John Cena and Randy Orton fought for the #1 Contendership to the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. These superstars, two of the most storied performers in WWE history, didn't have this match because storylines had built up this encounter in the demonic Hell in a Cell. It happened because the WWE needed to give John Cena something to do while current champion, Brock Lesnar, continues his months long hiatus. It was an afterthought of a match that paled in comparison to the PPV's main event, Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins in the same structure, which had brewed over months of excellently written betrayal, revenge, and brutality. WWE 2K15 on last-gen consoles is, sadly, more Cena/Orton than Rollins/Ambrose.""]"Brandin Tyrrel,3-Nov-14,Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers 20th Anniversary Edition Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/gabriel-knight-sins-of-the-fathers-20th-anniversar/1900-6415939/,6,PC,"['Over twenty years ago, a rash of bizarre serial killings rocked New Orleans with its grim voodoo trappings. Yet the Voodoo Murders did more than just turn The Big Easy on its side; they kicked off a dark, mature mystery, shaking up a landscape of point-and-click adventures predominately ruled by comedic misadventures and light-hearted tales of fantasy. Two decades later, Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers 20th Anniversary Edition reanimates that seedy drama with an admirable facelift, all-new puzzles, and a wealth of nostalgia-inducing behind-the-scenes content. But not everything is made better with a fresh coat of paint, as edgy storytelling is dulled by dated delivery, while technical blemishes and some obtuse puzzle solving hamper the experience.', ""Despite his blonde Prince Valiant modernization, the t-shirt-and-jeans-clad Gabriel Knight is still very much a persona created in 1993. He's the romanticized ambitionless writer, and delivers his sultry southern tones with an Elvis-like embellished seduction, noticeably replacing the game's original voice acting as part of the audio update. In fact, every new character model, re-envisioned locale, and stylishly drawn cutscene finds a way to stay true to the spirit of the source, while popping in new attitude. The enhanced audio and visual treatment is handled terrifically nearly everywhere, with exceptions being a few stray musical choices and dialog that feels purposefully overdelivered."", ""But the updates to the sights and sounds also serve to spotlight the cultural tones of the early '90s, and how they can feel out of place despite the fact they admittedly retrace their steps through that period. It's chiefly noticeable with Gabriel, who faithfully reprises his role of too-handsome-to-resist charmer who makes unctuous advances toward the opposite sex. And despite a cast of strongly written female characters, he mostly succeeds in his efforts, as intelligent, powerful women suddenly succumb to his wiles with alarming abruptness. It's in these moments that melodramatic dialog, and its overdone delivery, can tiptoe into cliche and seem more like a parody of the times rather than at home in them."", ""But his lascivious priorities aside, Gabriel is remarkably adept at getting what he wants. By massaging his connections with local law enforcement, and occasionally breaking the rules, he's managed to finagle an inside scoop on the Voodoo Murders as an outline for his next novel. It's a sturdy foundation that supports the first-rate murder-mystery storytelling of designer and author Jane Jensen's excellently researched infusion of history and Cajun flavor. And like the best mysteries, stakes continue to rise as pedestrian police work gives way to a globe-spanning supernatural occult that finds Gabriel, and his lineage, much more connected than it would first appear."", ' ', ""That shift in tone is steadily unraveled over a dozen hours of careful clue-gathering and puzzle-solving gameplay around the outskirts of New Orleans and the city proper. There's an almost staggering amount of things to see, interact with, and click on, and hours of detailed writing ready to be ingested through conversations with an eclectic supporting cast. Thankfully, all that content is smartly paced and broken up over the course of several days, with a rough objective set for each day, and constantly evolving characters and settings that allow for repeated visits without growing stale."", ""And though vital bits of information are hidden all over therein, many of the books and conversations serve no greater purpose than to flesh out the world; which is a lofty purpose in its own right. This fabricated snapshot of 1990s' New Orleans never feels overly linear. Like wandering through a museum, you're free to explore and pick up bits of pertinent, historical, or even irrelevant information without feeling forced toward the next checkpoint."", ""Most case clues in that dense fog of information eventually point toward the next with a little patient observation, along with a sense of accomplishment when the plucky tune indicating success chimes out. Of course that comes with a consideration: It's deceptively easy to get lost and stuck in the web of possibilities should you miss a beat. While constantly experimenting with new ways to connect pieces and further the case is a crucial part of Gabriel Knight, some of those connections are so vague and reaching that solving them by trial-and-error isn't realistic."", ""There's an almost staggering amount of things to see, interact with, and click on, and hours of detailed writing ready to be ingested through conversations with an eclectic supporting cast."", ""Fortunately, the 20th Anniversary Edition comes complete with a handy hint book that provides high-level nudges on where to go next, slowly revealing more details before finally just telling you what to do. It's a great inclusion that allows you to tailor the level of help you're given with particularly chin-stroking puzzles, but it comes with a fatal flaw. In some cases, when you're absolutely stuck and just want to know what to do progress the story, the final hint fails to deliver the answer."", ""After almost an hour spent exhausting conversation topics with Gabriel's grandmother and searching around her house for clues that could help to solve a clock puzzle in her attic, I gave up and ashamedly asked the hint book. Unfortunately this particular obstacle's final hint--the one that in nearly every other case spells out the answer--simply suggested I send Gabriel into his grandmother's attic to learn more about his family history. And so I resolved to do what no puzzle should ever force you to: I starting trying out each of the 72 combinations. I finally got it somewhere in the thirties."", ""And despite being the exception rather than the rule, those vaguely solvable puzzles that slam the brakes on gameplay progression are my biggest gripe with the Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers 20th Anniversary Edition; though they're not the only distracting element of the remake."", 'Along the way, small but obnoxious technical hiccups regularly blow away the air of mystery and immersion so carefully cultivated. Sometimes characters would contort in terrifying ways when interacting with Gabriel, or Gabriel himself would walk through a solid object, or become stuck as I issued an order while he was performing another. Each time this happened, part of the atmosphere disappeared, and I was no longer uncovering a mystery, but trying to progress through a game. These issues punctuate the experience, and though ostensibly minor, they do so with exclamation marks.', ""And yet breaking that illusion is to some degree one of the 20th Anniversary's greatest feats. Through the bonus special edition content, slowly unlocked alongside your story progression, a bevy of behind-the-scenes goodies are available to pore over. Enlightening tidbits like audio interviews with Jane Jensen and other members of the original design team, alongside storyboards, concept art and fantastic side-by-side asset comparisons that really emphasize just how far the medium has come in twenty years."", ""And that's really what Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers 20th Anniversary Edition has to offer. For every great point, there's some small, nagging nick in the experience. While the strong narrative and precisely delivered story is as mature and dense as it's ever, and positively carries the experience, it's also beginning to show its age. For every great string of clues that creatively come together to open up a new leg of the mystery, there's a puzzle that brings the experience to a crawl. Gabriel Knight is a conflicted man that, while rough around the edges, good at heart, and easy on the eyes, struggles with his own demons and obligations to his name. And twenty years later, the same can be said for his return to the medium.""]"Miguel Concepcion,3-Nov-14,Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-review/1900-6415933/,8,Xbox One & PS4,"[""By the time I finished Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare's single-player mode, I wanted to return to Seoul, South Korea, the setting of the game's first chapter. This mid-21st-century metropolis is awash in ultra modernity, to a degree I havent seen since visiting the economically prosperous version of Tokyo in the 1980s. It's the perfect futuristic backdrop to introduce Advance Warfare's new movement abilities, which are granted by the soldier-enhancing exosuit introduced in the campaign. And when you first bear witness to a flying giant snake made up purely of small drones roaming the streets of Seoul, you know this is new science-fictional territory for Call of Duty."", ""Sledgehammer Games crafted an opening that does everything a great first chapter is meant to do: it welcomes you with big-budget bravado, offers control tips without excessive hand-holding, and establishes the tone of the campaign. Welcome back to Call of Duty, the first chapter seems to say. Let's show the other games how to make a proper entrance. And while we're at it, let's test your subwoofer with the bass of an explosion and the vibrations of slow-motion melodrama. This is an introduction that kicks off the wartime journey of protagonist Jack Mitchell, played by Troy Baker. He begins as a U.S. Marine, but after a catastrophic event during his first mission, he joins Atlas, a private military corporation run by the generically named Jonathan Irons, who is played by a realistically-rendered Kevin Spacey."", ""It's never been easier for a Call of Duty campaign to justify the series' traditional chapter-by-chapter globetrotting. When the services of the Atlas Corporation are sold to the highest bidder, every country is fair game. That said, Mitchell's story isn't as clear-cut as it seems; he isnt simply a Marine-turned-mercenary who travels where Irons tells him to. His tours offer a smattering of memorable missions, including a fast-paced intra-city manhunt through Santorini and several pulse-quickening escape sequences. Even Kevin Spaceys boastful tour of an Atlas facility is a pleasurable golf-cart ride on rails that wouldnt feel out of place as an EPCOT Center attraction, albeit one with a lot of killing machines in the background."", ""Aside from the positively imaginative two-chapter tutorial that kicks off the campaign, the one mission that leaves a lasting impression is a tense stealth op that prominently features a grappling hook. This tool is notably exclusive to the campaign, and when you discover its capabilities beyond traversing man-made structures, you can see why it was omitted from the multiplayer. The myriad locales work not only to minimize monotony, but also serve to showcase the talents of Sledgehammers art team in war-torn urbanity, dark forests, and sun-drenched deserts. Advanced Warfare's visuals come nowhere near the exquisite detail of the Metro Redux shooters; that would likely kill the game's 60 frames-per-second smoothness, which would be sacrilegious to the series."", ""Call of Duty games typically provide the chance to snuff out enemies from afar in their campaigns, but surprisingly, there is only one such sequence in Advanced Warfare. To be fair, though, enemy weapon drops are plentiful in scoped firearms, often with the same see-through-walls technology as one of the tech grenades. Sledgehammers future vision of weapon tech is positively practical with heads-up displays that are as clean as they are informative. The game varies the action in other ways, such as with a riveting sequence involving a jet ski with diving capabilities. (The campaign's other brief vehicular sections are unremarkable.) Certainly, I would have preferred more of these breaks from standard combat over the arduous occasions when you're asked to push objects. It is hardly a pleasure to shove an overturned van while having to endure the intentionally abrasive metal-on-pavement noise that accompanies it."", ""Advanced Warfares ties to the past are few. The only time you feel the weight of history is during the introductory chapter in Seoul: in a battle in which North Korea was invading South Korea in the mid-2050s, the 100th anniversary of the Korean Armistice Agreement is not lost in the chaos. Instead of looking back, Sledgehammer Games delivers a future-facing story laden with disappointing predictability and villain posturing befitting a Roger Moore-era James Bond film. Advanced Warfare serves so many classic bad guy one-liners that by the final act my eye-rolling gave way to resignation. I was left hoping that this Call of Duty had a point to its uncharacteristically cartoon-like dramatics, but it instead leaves you with an unsatisfying conclusion driven by a tonally inconsistent script. When the credits roll, you may be disappointed the villain didn't round off his checklist of cliches by uttering, We're not so different, you and I."", ""Whether intentional or not, the campaign is a narrative of echoes. If you've played your share of shooters from the last decade, you've seen these settings before. The passages of a naval ship echo the then-stupendous opening of Call of Duty 4, as does having a hardened British field mentor at your side for many of the chapters. Even if an obligatory bridge chapter reinforces the campaign's shortage of originality, at least these instances do not take away from the consistent entertainment of the overall playthrough. It follows the typical rhythm of a Call of Duty campaign, in which consecutive ground combat sections are broken up with a chase, a cutscene, or a quick time event."", ""Even though Advanced Warfare is set in the future, Im glad Sledgehammer wasnt compelled to show off nuclear-level devastation on the scale of Call of Duty: Ghosts' gratuitous opening. Nevertheless, Advanced Warfare stumbles when evocation gives way to shock with minimal exposition. This happens during a scene that's meant to echo World War II atrocities, depicting disturbing incidents of human experimentation. Without explanation or context, this scene only provokes for the sake of it, making any themes it raises tough subjects for meaningful discussion."", ""The majority of Advance Warfare's campaign gameplay adheres to Call of Duty's linear first-person shooter level progression, where combat boils down to suppression of the enemy near and far. There are also a handful of looser missions that hint at what a Call of Duty game might be if it aspired to the wide-linear designs of the two latest Crysis games. Those games excel by minimizing the frustration of death, where getting killed gives you the opportunity to try a new path or strategy with each respawn. Many of Advanced Warfares sections are spacious enough to experiment with new routes, and provide optional opportunities to use the exosuit. Yet therein lies one of the campaign's shortcomings: a lack of incentives to frequently use the exosuit. In the campaign, using these movement abilities is seldom mandatory, but always optional, and many environments allow plenty of room in which to play around. Nevertheless, the plethora of cover points will easily keep you alive, so why take a chance of being exposed, considering enemies arent especially aggressive? The boost dashes and double jumps are immensely useful to evade enemies; not so much if you want to take the fight to them. The ability to hover in single player is only useful for the few times you need to stick a landing from a multistory drop."", ""The thoroughness of the mobility-focused tutorial in the first chapter may lead you to think that the rest of the single-player mode would be rich in moments that encourage verticality, dodging, and temporary flight. Such events are only sprinkled through the game's 15 chapters, as there are too few sections in which using an exo ability is mandatory. The campaign is an entertaining ride as a whole, but being able to progress through most of it with a classic Call of Duty approach is wholly unfortunate, as it contradicts the expectations set by the futuristic motifs of the initial chapter in Seoul and that fantastical giant drone snake."", 'His tours offer a smattering of memorable missions, including a fast-paced intra-city manhunt through Santorini and several pulse-quickening escape sequences.', 'You can trust that bloodthirsty friends and strangers in multiplayer will make sure you know every movement ability, lest you desire a humbling kill/death ratio. You never forget your first death at the hands of an online opponent who outmaneuvered you with a midair strafe-double jump combo. The moment you witness such a move is the moment you want to learn it. The tired adage of ""Easy to learn, hard to master"" does not apply here; rather, it\'s Moderately tough to learn, even tougher to master. It\'s one thing to instantly see the benefits of a power slide or a double jump; it\'s another to apply these abilities in useful and practical ways. The lessons of First-Person Shooter Survival 101 and the economies of movement apply here: Just because you don\'t want to be killed while standing still doesn\'t mean you should be moving at all times.', 'The maps arent quite like the Call of Duty maps youve played before: the upward mobility provided by the exosuit calls for more vertical structures. Advance Warfare does a fine job in addressing issues with first-person platforming, letting you catch the edges of rooftops if your double jump wasnt as long as you expected. Thats not to say that the maps completely cater to every new ability. As fun as it is to evade a hunter by sliding under a pickup truck, these multiplayer maps arent packed with such escape points. This kind of scarcity only makes wise use of the slide move all the more meaningful. Map memorization is thus all the more crucial, especially given how the maps in Advanced Warfare are understandably larger than typical Call of Duty maps.', 'With great abilities come expanded loadout options. The Pick 10 System that worked so well for Call of Duty: Black Ops II has expanded to 13 picks. This level of flexibility is tied to the one-size-fits-all-modes design philosophy of the 13 maps. Sledgehammer does not reconfigure arenas to suit a given game type; you are expected to adapt to each mode by having a custom loadout at the ready. A self-tailored speed-based loadout is crucial for the new point-based Uplink mode. This mode takes much of its inspiration from end-to-end goal-scoring sports like basketball and soccer, asking you to throw or dunk a device into an endpoint. Uplink is still primarily concerned with the shooting action, however, and thus defies categorization as a mere novelty mode. Its also terribly absorbing.', ""For all the futuristic weapons technology at your disposal, there's comfort in having these firearms in multiplayer sorted into familiar categories. Like donning a new pair of shoes with zero break-in time, creating a comfortable loadout of fictional weapons suited for Team Deathmatch takes little brainwork. If youre a Call of Duty veteran, don't be surprised if your initial loadout yields a satisfying kill/death ratio after your very first match. The only thing better than slotting a high damage IMR assault rifle in your loadout is seeing immediate results through your bodycount."", ""Progressing and obtaining rewards in Advanced Warfare's multiplayer is a layered experience, and Sledgehammer has erred on the side of excess. Beyond the straightforward rewards of actively participating in matches, the studio also recognizes the appeal of the blind box though its Supply Drop system. Considering that it would take tens upon tens of hours to unlock every possible Supply Drop item, it's a relief there's no risk of unlocking duplicate items. The one exception is if you convert an unwanted Supply Drop reward into experience, which is a practical option for some, but it opens up the possibility of unlocking that item again."", ""This abundance of content is also seen in the suite of multiplayer modes. Hardpoint, not seen since Call of Duty: Black Ops, makes a much welcome return since it serves as Advanced Warfare's King of the Hill mode. Due to their fundamental similarities, Uplink could have easily replaced Capture the Flag as the only delivery-style match. Instead, both are offered, as if Sledgehammer is saying, Let's give the fans almost every mode imaginable and let them decide what will be the popular modes in six months time. The finishing touch on this rich inventory of content is an acknowledgement to the Call of Duty purists: four classic modes (Team Deathmatch, Domination, Kill Confirmed, and Search and Destroy) that are played without exo movement. This works both as a throwback to familiar locomotion and as an experiment on how traditional matches would play out in maps larger than prior Call of Duty multiplayer maps. You wont find anything as tiny as the Hijacked yacht from Black Ops 2; some maps in Advanced Warfare can fit a boat three times that size."", ""In contrast to the map-altering catastrophes you can trigger in Call of Duty: Ghosts, Advanced Warfare's multiplayer shows restraint in dynamic map events. A tsunami warning in the San Francisco map will compel many first timers to hurriedly search for higher ground, only to realize the ensuing flood is a laughably minor and temporary one. Sledgehammer should also be commended for designing original multiplayer maps without borrowing heavily from the single-player locales. Equally impressive are the settings not featured in the campaign, including a volcano in Hawaii and a space elevator platform in the Gulf of Mexico. These maps are generally roomy, but hardly bereft of confining spaces and narrow hallways. In sector-control modes like Momentum and Hardpoint, the hallways in maps like Bio Lab and Greenband make for brutally crowded gunfights ripe for increasing both your kill and death counts. These battles would be frustrating were the chaos in the moment not so fun and hilarious."", ""Advanced Warfare foregoes the novelty of ghosts and zombies in its wave-based cooperative mode, dubbed Exo-Survival. It's just as well; when you have drones, double-jumping soldiers, and hulking armored suits swarming towards your foursome, are supernatural armed forces necessary? As if to boast the versatility of the 13 multiplayer maps, none of the locales have been altered to suit any specific needs for human-versus-bot combat. The maps are divided into four difficulty tiers, partly based on how the terrain of each setting helps or hurts your team. For example, the three points of entry in the hotel lobby of the Terrace map make this reception area an ideal home base. The challenge arrives when you must leave the comforts of the lobby during non-defensive missions. When you only have 90 seconds to collect 20 dog tags and a map that is as tall as it is wide, a team that splits up without pairing up is most likely a dead one. The map called Riot, on the other hand, has little to no spots in which to safely huddle for a defensive posture, so it's no surprise that it's the only Tier 4 map. If you're looking for a first-person recreation of the nerve-wracking elevated position scene from the film The Rock, play the Riot map in Exo-Survival."", ""Level complexity is a factor, and is one of the reasons why the modest two-story Bio-Lab map is classified as Tier 1. With many obvious bot entry points, Bio-Lab is a fitting starter map for Exo-Survival newcomers. Surviving a round yields currency to spend on upgrades, and it's not unusual to max out armor or weapon stats by the 30th round. The likelihood of passing 40 rounds on a first or second attempt brings about two classic yet unexpected opponents: complacency and overconfidence. You seldom see this issue in wave-based survival modes, where the progression of difficulty is often much steeper. Even in a Tier 1 map, ending a session should be the result of your team dying, not of your team getting bored and wanting to try try a harder tier. I would have preferred the option of elevating to a higher tier after clearing 40 or so rounds so my teammates could maintain their momentum without having to back out into the lobby."", ""The last time Call of Duty had Warfare in its subtitle, it led to a well-received trilogy that deftly transitioned the series away from a well-trodden global conflict to modern-day combat. If the settings of today have run their course just as World War II did years ago, Advanced Warfare makes for a convincing foundation of futuristic yet relatable combat that is worth exploring and expanding further. The huge change in player mobility is less of a paradigm shift and more of an overdue retooling for an 11-year-old FPS franchise, especially in a year of mobility-focused shooters. Yet for all its predictability, Advanced Warfare is a deluge of action-film bravado, and it's difficult to not be carried away by its tidal forces."", ' ']"Mark Walton,2-Nov-14,Ultimate NES Remix Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ultimate-nes-remix-review/1900-6415937/,7,3DS,"[""With their bite-sized chunks of nostalgic NES challenges, the NES Remix games always seemed better suited to quick blasts on a 3DS rather than extended sessions in front of a Wii U. Perhaps that's why, despite Ultimate NES Remix being a simple compilation of its two couch-bound predecessors, it's so darn appealing."", ""Of course, much of that appeal comes down to just how invested you are in the Nintendo universe. NES Remix is all about nostalgia, from the 8-bit-inspired music and menus, to the classic cuts of games that make up its many challenges. Like the games that inspired them, the remixed challenges play to the old-school mechanics of score chasing and speed, focusing on dexterity and concentration over more modern conceits like accessibility and story. That's not to say knowing how to make Mario jump over a set of obstacles is particularly challenging, but doing so against the clock when the obstacles suddenly turn invisible most certainly is."", ""For score chasers and difficulty aficionados, NES Remix proves to be an entertaining experience. Remixed games are divided into several challenges, each of which awards you with a star rating, depending on how long it takes you to complete it. As someone who can't leave well enough alone, the sight of those one- and two-star completions nestled among the shiny threes is enough drive me loopy; when the completist drive kicks in, it's very hard to stop."", ""The Mario challenges prove to be the most fun, which should come as no surprise given the brilliance of the games they're based on. There's little adaptation needed to fit Mario into bite-sized chunks, with speed runs, coin collecting, and defeating classic Bowser bosses making up a good portion of the challenges. There are some neat twists on the formula where Mario is invincible for the entire level, or where multiple 1-Up mushrooms are hidden on screen for you to discover. The Remix versions take things further, blacking out sections of a level, adding distracting clones, and replacing characters with those from Mario sequels."", ""Speaking of which, both the cruelly underrated US version of Super Mario Bros. 2 (the infamous port of Doki Doki Panic) and the Japanese version make appearances, although it's the former that features some of the most memorable challenges. The wacky handling of characters like the disturbingly floaty Princess Peach is used to great effect, particularly when those characters are transported to other versions of Mario games, in which the airy handling makes for some particularly challenging jumps across platforms not designed for them."", ""Other highlights include Little Mac's career from Punch Out!!, which is as much a puzzle game as it is a fighter. Nailing those tricky dodges by looking at the tells of your opponent is as cruel and as tense as ever, making victory against those muscled titans oh so satisfying. Kirby's remixed levels are similarly great, with one standout placing the ghosts of Mario onto a boss level, requiring you to quickly turn around to stop their progress while simultaneously trying to suck down fruit to fire back at the boss."", ""The whole lineup works wonderfully as a nostalgic tour of Nintendo's impressive back catalogue, or as a history lesson to those not old enough to remember them the first time around. Zelda, Donkey Kong, Metroid, Kid Icarus: these are the series that introduced an entire generation to video games, and age has done little to sour their excellence. Only lesser-known titles--the likes of Balloon Fight and Excitebike--fail to hit the mark, but maybe that's as much down to them not being a part of my childhood as it is down to the mundane challenges within."", 'Aside from the challenges, Championship Mode from NES Remix 2 returns, giving you the chance to play through three quick-fire sections of Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 3, and Dr. Mario, with an accumulated score awarded at the end. A new addition comes in the form of Speed Mario Bros., which, as the name suggests, is the entirety of Super Mario Bros., but significantly sped up. Suffice to say, it is very difficult, but skilled players will be able to perform some seriously impressive speed runs with it.', ""There's enough variety and challenge on offer in Ultimate NES Remix, not to mention some powerful nostalgia, to keep you glued to the screen for longer than you think 30-second challenges ever could. Sure, if you own older versions of the game, there's nothing new here for you to see, but NES Remix's new home on the 3DS makes so much sense that you might be inspired to go back and attempt those challenges again.""]"John Robertson,2-Nov-14,Football Manager 2015 Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/football-manager-2015-review/1900-6415936/,8,PC,"[""Trying to be too clever too early will cost you your job, and that's something you'd do well to understand before starting your managerial career in Football Manager 2015."", ""It started a month ago, myself and others suffering London's public transport for nearly two hours to visit Victoria Road, the home ground of English Football League 2 strugglers Dagenham and Redbridge. The match was against York City, an equally incapable outfit favouring physicality over finesse. Standing in the terrace, flanked by the supporters group's inexhaustible drummer, we witnessed the 'Daggers' beat York 2-0 in a game characterised by long punts forward and blue language from the dugout."", ""Somehow inspired by this, I decided to kick off my Football Manager 2015 career as the boss of Dagenham, with grand ambitions to one day get them to the Santiago Bernabeu to take on Real Madrid in a Champions League clash. It didn't quite happen. 17 games, 11 defeats and fewer goals later, I was sacked. I should have done what I usually do: take a job at an elite club with a view to learning the year's new quirks before getting smart and overseeing a minnow."", ""The major problems at Dagenham revolved around scouting and coaching, two key pillars of any club not lucky enough to be backed by a member of the Middle East's ruling elite. Unlike in past editions of Sports Interactive's data-heavy management sim, player recruitment is more tightly aligned with the accumulated knowledge of your scouts, making their expertise more crucial than ever before. Putting together a dream team of 12 or more experienced scouts is easy for the big clubs, but the tighter purse-strings of smaller outfits makes such an act less simple."", ""Such recruitment constraints limit the number of players known to you and your club. Yes, you can still search for any specific player within the game's vast database--whether your scouts know of their existence or not--but this requires substantial prior knowledge on your part and removes the joy that comes from uncovering new talent."", 'To further complicate things, scouting a player no longer guarantees full knowledge of his strengths and weaknesses. Sending a scout to go check out a potential transfer target results in a range of numbers (from 1 to 20) being applied to individual attributes, with their true ability found somewhere amongst the ambiguity. Sending your scouts to watch him again narrows the range and gives you a better idea of their true ability, but by that time the transfer window might have shut or another team may have poached him away.', ""When recruiting scouts, then, it's now essential that you look at their existing knowledge, rather than only their future potential in finding players. The more players you already know about, the more chance you have of instantly filling holes in your squad without taking financial risks on unknown individuals."", ""If that all sounds rather complicated, that's because it is. However, as series aficionados know, it's this very complexity that results in the complete engagement and frequent obsession with the franchise. FIFA and PES is like watching football; Football Manager is like living it."", ""This year, you've got more options as to how you want to engage in that realism by defining what kind of manager you want to be. Before you begin you're asked to choose between being a tracksuit or tactical manager; the former excels in coaching, while the latter has skills in mental and tactical areas. It's possible to be a mixture of both, but this puts you into that awful position of being a jack of all trades and a master of none."", 'As someone that watches Dagenham at weekends, I smugly lay my roots firmly on the tactical side of the coin--more of a Jose Mourinho character than a Sean Dyche. With your man management, adaptability, and motivational stats at the higher end of the scale, your players are better placed to employ the tactical information you feed them, and react better to learning multiple systems and styles of play.', ""What this approach lacks, however, is much expertise when it comes to leading training sessions and passing on the core foundation that every good player must have to succeed. Therefore, you have to make up for your deficiencies by hiring coaches that are capable of doing what you can't, delegating to them when necessary, and working in unison with their skill set rather than trying to do everything yourself."", ""As with scouting, it's important to take great care in selecting which coaches to hire and how closely you work with them. The degree to which this affects your career as a manager, especially after a season or two of building relationships with staff and understanding their abilities, is surprisingly high."", ""Predictably, tweaks, and changes have been made to the layout of the game's multitude of menus in a bid to further improve functionality and streamline the interface. Your most important links are now hosted in a vertical bar on the left side of the screen, displaced from its long-term home along the top. This change is awkward at first, but it ultimately proves useful, reducing the number of sub-screens you have to navigate in order to get to commonly used areas of the managerial desk."", ""Technical upgrades have been applied to the 3D match engine, with players looking smoother and having a greater range of animations to work with. It's a nice addition, but many players will continue to simply let their matches play out exclusively in text form, reducing the amount of time it takes to get through games."", 'Other than these changes, Football Manager 2015 is more evolutionary than revolutionary. New player movement systems and roles are included for you to come up with more elaborate match day strategies, and media interaction has been updated to include interviews before and after matches.', 'Sometimes things feel too familiar, though. The Challenges game mode, which tests your skills across a number of crushingly difficult scenarios, features the same objectives as previous games. There are also still too few options for customizing the core colour scheme of the game, which is disappointing given the hundreds of hours that people spend sat in front of it.', ""However, Football Manager is about progress, not revolution, which is arguably what its audience wants, and exactly what this year's game provides. Sports Interactive has crafted a game as predictably exhaustive as Andre Villas-Boas's gameplan, but as brutally effective as one masterminded by Mourinho. Football Manager has long since attained cult status and this release serves only to further stimulate that dedicated subculture.""]"Cameron Woolsey,31-Oct-14,Dungeon of the Endless Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dungeon-of-the-endless-review/1900-6415938/,7,PC,"['Dungeon of the Endless draws its influences from a wide variety of sources. It features elements from roguelikes, turn-based, and strategy games like XCOM and FTL while blending in some tower defense ingredients, carefully shaping them into the mold of a dungeon crawler. With so many distinct pieces, any imbalance in the scales would have resulted in a failed experiment. But Dungeon of the Endless brings together its disparate parts beautifully. While a lack of variety and some harmful glitches do harm the presentation, the impeccable gameplay balance, as well as the hunt for new characters and an excellent multiplayer mode, can keep you engaged for long after you sit down to play.', 'In Dungeon of the Endless, you guide a small, hand-picked team from room to room, using a large crystal to illuminate discovered areas, all the while looking for an exit point that takes you to an express elevator that only goes up. There are 12 floors between you and freedom, and surviving until you reach the surface of a hostile alien planet is your only goal--but the path ahead is obscured in darkness and peril.', 'The crystal, however, is the torch to light the way. Collecting a resource called dust, you power up your crystal to energize rooms, which then become temporary safe zones. But each level is procedurally generated, so you never know what the other side of a door yields. You could discover a stockpile of dust if youre lucky or a gang of ravenous monstrosities if youre not.', 'If micromanagement is your dish of choice, Dungeon of the Endless offers a full plate and a second helping, so come hungry. Not only do you have to maneuver a team of up to four heroes while collecting dust, you must also gather three other resources while building turrets to stave off advancing waves of alien foes who are out to destroy your crystal. And if they accomplish their goal, you have to start all over. You construct modules to collect resources or to build turrets. Major modules collect said resources in the forms of industry, which is spent on creating new modules; science, which upgrades existing modules; and food, which allows you to heal or level up your team or recruit new heroes. Minor modules consist of turrets, ranging from laser blasters to mortars to devices that can heal or strengthen your heroes.', 'There is a lot of strategy to consider as you hunt down your exit. Dust is a limited resource, and you almost never have enough to power every room in each expansive level. Lighting a room stops enemies from spawning there, but the longer you take to find your way out, the more darkened rooms are left behind--each one capable of spawning dozens of monsters. With this in mind, you are left with the task of how to best manage your heroes. A favorite strategy of mine involves taking the fastest members of the group as a scouting party while placing stronger (but slower) heroes in a darkened room to keep enemies from spawning or at choke points with turrets to halt the march of any attacking foes.', 'Its a lot to handle, but the games sharp design keeps everything balanced. Controlling your team is smooth and intuitive; you can select all your heroes with a button, or just take a small group to scout ahead while leaving others to guard the rear. Working with the mouse and keyboard is effortless, making way for quick, deft movement to navigate your team while using a tactical map to coordinate attacks or retreats. You can also pause the action to give yourself some time to plan your next move.', 'If micromanagement is your dish of choice, Dungeon of the Endless offers a full plate and a second helping, so come hungry.', 'Finding the exit completely changes how you approach the game. Where exploration and survival were the initial focus, the final part of the level is a mad dash to take your fragile crystal and slowly move it to the exit. One character is needed to carry it, making him or her unable to attack. Enemies surge from the darkness in an endless stream, and its up to your remaining heroes to protect the crystal during its perilous journey. But this is not an easy task. The game is difficult, and watching your crystal bearer succumb to a wave of gnashing foes just inches before the exit is almost too gut-wrenching to witness.', 'Dungeon of the Endless provides you with only four available heroes, but many more can be found roaming the floors. You begin your journey with two heroes in a party but can recruit up to two more. As your knowledge of each character grows, you can figure out new ways to fit them into your party. Pairing a burly tank character with a nimble thief, whose speed and passive ability to sneak past enemies without drawing their gaze, is a good start. But throwing in some brains isnt such a bad idea, either. An engineer, for example, scurries about a room repairing damaged modules, all the while mumbling sage advice on how keeping equipment in working order returns the favor to its users. Characters can be equipped with a wide assortment of weapons and gear found throughout the game. Many items are discovered in treasure chests, but others can be purchased from a merchant, who trades his wares for resources.', 'Colorfully pixelated, the ever-shifting environments keep your flight to the surface from becoming stale. Brushed steel and the flickering lights of a Hollywood sci-fi setting adorn the halls of one level, while other floors display something more akin to the home of a necromancer: Lit by flickering torchlight, potions dot the ground, and the walls are lined with old books or prison cells--the inhabitants now lifeless skeletons. In other levels, the walls pulsate and ooze, while frozen zones covered in ice yield large, mammoth-like skulls. A great use of lighting effects helps sell the feeling of dread and isolation of the strange world. Characters, monsters, and alien flora covered in waving tendrils cast creepy shadows against objects and walls, giving the atmosphere an eerie and foreboding quality. Enemies themselves are also widely varied, from crystalline golems to sorcerers that cast spells.', 'Reaching the planets surface for the first time is an immensely rewarding feeling, but, unfortunately, it isnt one you will experience again. Variation in the levels is moderate, and once you have conquered all 12 floors, you have seen just about everything Dungeon of the Endless has to offer. Replaying the game to unlock more characters escape pods that change how you approach the game is pleasurable, but even that doesnt last for too long. Once I completed the game, taking four heroes to the surface, the thought of playing it all over again wasnt particularly exciting.', 'The games mantra of proper balance is reflected again in its multiplayer mode, with split resources and responsibilities, making for a gratifyingly enjoyable time. You and up to three others combine your efforts and work together to make it out of the dungeon alive. Each player controls one hero, and since your life is now in the hands of others and vice versa, constant communication is a must to survive, though it does slow down the pace of the game. Deciding whether to explore the area some more or quickly make for the escape exit once its found makes for some surprisingly tense conversation. Ive experienced a game where votes on decisions were tallied, as well as they often should, as one false step could lead to failure. But nothing beats the sense of satisfaction that comes with successfully completing a difficult level; the sighs of relief and cheers in the elevator between missions are palpable.', 'Dungeon of the Endless isnt free of issues. In multiplayer mode, the lack of item trading keeps valuable weapons and gear out of the hands of those who need it most. There is also no host migration, forcing games to end prematurely if the game creator has to leave or gets disconnected. Other problems range from glitches to problematic menus. At times, turrets dont face enemies while firing, and sometimes character menus seem to stick and require some extra jabbing with the mouse pointer to free them. But those are merely nitpicky issues. Actual problems include a particularly annoying glitch that prevents you from purchasing new items from the merchant. Normally, this bug is fixed by restarting your saved game and speaking with the merchant again. But running across it online, where restarting is impossible, creates a frustrating scenario where any useful items now have to be left behind.', 'Great use of lighting effects helps sell the feeling of dread and isolation of the strange world.', 'Dungeon of the Endless manages to pull off the especially difficult task of cobbling together parts from multiple genres, ultimately creating something that feels special. The incredible balancing act alone is worthy of some attention, if not for its excellent multiplayer mode, which definitely merits a good look. While the lack of gameplay variety and an occasional kink or two does slow its ascent, Dungeon of the Endless is an elevator from hell that will keep you entertained for hours.']"Brett Todd,31-Oct-14,Planetary Annihilation Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/planetary-annihilation-review/1900-6415935/,7,PC,"[""Total Annihilation goes intergalactic, and at hyperspeed. That, in a nutshell, describes Planetary Annihilation, Uber Entertainment's homage to one of the all-time greatest real-time strategy games. The game comes with some key enhancements, however, including a challenging pace and enemy artificial intelligence, along with full globes of cartoony planets and moons serving as battlegrounds. RTS newcomers will have a tough time with the sheer velocity of the combat and the lack of proper tutorials and manuals, as will tacticians who prefer to think before they click. But the speed, difficulty, and map innovations make Planetary Annihilation grow on you."", 'I wouldn\'t have said so in the early hours, though. Planetary Annihilation steamrolled me initially. The game comes with little in the way of documentation. There is no in-game tutorial; all the primers that you get before being dropped on a planet come from blurry videos that barely hint at what the game has to offer. To figure things out, you should watch an hour or three of YouTube videos and search the Internet for tips. Until you research, you are cannon fodder on map after map. Planetary Annihilation desperately needs a proper tutorial that lets players dip their toes into the deep waters; the ""jump in head-first"" approach doesn\'t work with a game this unforgiving.', 'The underlying RTS formula is familiar, at least. As in Total Annihilation, you start off with a giant commander that has the power to construct various parts of your headquarters, including vehicle and robot builders, power plants (energy is one resource), metal extractors (metal is the other), laser turrets, and so forth. Every faction is led by one of these bosses, so victory comes when you blast these Transformer wannabes into rubble. There is a simple progression here. You start with your commander and then create a fabricator vehicle with access to even more facility blueprints and improved factories that can crank out bigger and better tanks, planes, bots, ships, and orbital weaponry and vessels. Then you create advanced versions of all this stuff that handle heavier duties that lead to even more formidable armies.', ""Planetary Annihilation sticks you into a quick-tempo arms race that rolls from planet to planet, from moon to moon. From the moment that your big robot commander hits the ground, you need to establish facilities and ensure that you have a production line running at maximum efficiency. Units need to be streaming out continuously, and knowledge of hotkeys is imperative, especially when the guns start going off. The enemy AI always gets its armies flowing quickly, so taking extra time to play with the mouse or contemplate what type of tank would be most useful in the current situation results in being besieged and obliterated. You don't even have any time to spare when the foe is a planet or two away, as the bad guys rapidly send a transport your way and then build the transporter needed to beam full armies to your front door."", 'Foes can attack from any direction. Unlike other RTS games with traditional flat maps, the battlegrounds here are full globes. Planets look rather cartoony, as they are extremely tiny, your units are spectacularly huge, or both. But they form effective theaters of war and feature various types of terrain ranging from ice balls, to desert worlds, to chunks of metal. Its hard to get used to at first; RTS instinct might have you building defenses between your bases and the enemy, forgetting that all opponents must do to flank is to simply run around the globe. This strategic consideration caught me off guard in the early stages, and forced me to spend more time walling off bases and ensuring that I had proper turret protection all the way around against ground and aerial assaults.', 'Make sure to build defenses again orbital attacks, too. As you might expect from a game where you conquer planets and moons, space is a key dimension in addition to the traditional land, air, and sea units. Orbital constructors crank out spaceships like fighters and transport vessels necessary to launch interplanetary invasions (although transporters make it easy to teleport armies across the void instantaneously after you establish a beachhead). This whole concept is initially befuddling; AI makes full use of space attacks, so you might be convinced at first that some buildings are blowing up on their own. Once you surmount that learning curve and stage an invasion, however, the course of battle becomes easier to understand. There is also the ability to build Death Stars by fitting guns into metal worlds and crashing one planetary body into another, giving matches a suitably apocalyptic feel.', 'The AI is cunning and spectacularly aggressive. It builds quickly, creates a solid base infrastructure with loads of power plants and metal extractors, and immediately sets forth to crush all opposition. It is smart at reacting to your defenses. Build a ton of anti-air defenses to deal with enemy planes, and the AI will quickly react by throwing more tanks and ships at you. Any vulnerability is identified and attacked, even on the default normal difficulty, making the challenge occasionally difficult to take. You might get a base set up, think you have everything covered, and be ready to roll out enough fighters and bombers to blot out the sky, only to be steadily whittled away by probing enemy strikes that are inevitably followed up by massive waves of units.', ""An easier difficulty setting might have provided time to get fully accustomed to the interface and then ramp up the speed, but its global battles can get under your skin, keeping you coming back for more and more. Planetary Annihilation is a good, challenging RTS designed along very familiar lines. True, its best qualities can be obscured in the early going by its unforgiving difficulty and the absence of good tutorials, but even when you're overwhelmed, speedy combat and smart AI reel you in. Give it time, and the fast and furious combat smooth out the rough edges into a compelling and challenging strategy game.""]"Kevin VanOrd,30-Oct-14,Dreamfall Chapters Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dreamfall-chapters-book-one-reborn-review/1900-6415934/,7,PC,"[""Eight years is a long time to wait for answers, and the opening scenes of Dreamfall Chapters understand as much, providing a tearful gut-punch that is as much of a conclusion as it is an introduction. This is the universe that has occupied my thoughts and fantasies since 1999, when The Longest Journey was released and earned rightful praise as one of the best adventure games ever made. It was a game about balance: the balance between the mundane and the magical, the head and the heart. Its sequel, 2006's Dreamfall, found new worlds to balance--those of waking life and dreams--and Dreamfall Chapters returns to this same theme soon after its emotional opening. Returning Dreamfall heroine Zoe Castillo has remained comatose, but she has not allowed her body to serve as a prison."", ""Those earlier games provided another kind of balance: that between a slow-paced opening and meaningful narrative tension that rose as the stakes grew higher. The first episode of Dreamfall Chapters provides the former, laying the groundwork for a potentially rousing adventure, but too little rises from that foundation. Those eight years between Dreamfall and its sequel were long--but I suspect that the wait between the Dreamfall Chapters' first and second episodes will feel just as lengthy, even if it's a matter of months and not years. As part of a long-term arc, Book One: Reborn may prove highly effective; on its own, it plays at a measured adagio that rarely quickens. The episodic format doesn't seem a good fit for the series' long-term storytelling, and I felt stranded by the abrupt ending, as if I had been invited to an opulent dinner only to arrive and find no one was home."", ""Dreamfall Chapters may begin with an answer, but it is more concerned with questions--questions that you can add to the growing list of Longest Journey mysteries. The nature of the Tower being built in Marcuria, the relationship of the Undreaming to the dream machines, the identity of the white dragon: these lingering wonders are left to occupy your thoughts while you navigate Book One's more pressing themes. Zoe's spirit has been left to wander the Dreamtime, that otherworldly dimension first introduced in Dreamfall, even as her body rests in hospital. Here, she helps those stranded in the Dreamtime, people in the waking world that are connected to WATIcorp's dream machines, which provide on-demand dreams as entertainment to the masses."", ""The subsequent level provides both an intriguing setting and an effective tutorial, putting you in control of Zoe from a third-person perspective, and having you assist lost dreamers in finding their way home. A selection cursor automatically hones in on interactive objects in your field of vision, flipping between choices as you move and look about, and indicating the type of interaction available with an appropriate icon. This system is a natural progression from Dreamfall's selection cone, making both controller and keyboard-and-mouse setups viable options."", 'More importantly, this sequence familiarizes you with Dreamfall Chapters\' dialogue mechanics, which allow you to choose responses that suit your vision of Zoe. One of the game\'s successes is how it allows you to set a path, but ensures that all paths are authentic to this lovable woman who captivated me and so many others years ago. Zoe has always been gentle but aimless, making her indecision during these conversations an authentic aspect of her character, and not a game-ish contrivance that contradicts the earlier games\' linear tales. When faced with a choice, Zoe thinks each choice aloud as you hover over it, speaking every line with a thoughtfulness and sincerity that should easily win you over. ""I\'m not ready to wake up, to face myself again,"" she thinks to herself. ""I\'m scared of losing what little I have left."" Having found a purpose in this supernatural zone, it is no wonder she would have reservations about leaving. But because her choices--and therefore yours as well--occupy different places in the same emotional spectrum, none of them contradict what we already know of her.', 'Zoe ultimately finds her way back to the real world--well, the real world the series calls Stark, in any case--but her memories of the past are left behind in the Dreamtime. Months after her revival, Zoe has made a home in Propast, another of the series\' rich and gorgeous locales. It\'s a multicultural neighborhood, far removed from the dystopias science-fiction stories typically depict. Propast is a future that rose from a past and present we understand; that the city should be home to people with American, European, Asian, and African accents is perfectly reasonable. This is the global village the age of the Internet has produced. Gorgeous lamps sway above you as you traverse the Chinese district; just blocks away, neon signs written in German (""Sonnenschein"" consumer goods company) and English advertisements (""Cloud Nine Prosthetics"") peacefully coexist. Food carts sell every kind of food you can imagine from the world over. You have never been to this city, but it sure feels like home.', ""The relationship between technology and culture isn't always so peaceful in Dreamfall Chapters, though your earlier choices determine how you approach that dichotomy. In my time with Zoe, I learned about her job as a laboratory technician, and set about testing synthetic algae with the help of a little hovering robot called Kidbot. Other players have told me of a mechanical friend called Shitbot, but my choices never led me down a path that included him. I don't regret my time with Kidbot, however: her playfulness is cute but never grating, a difficult balancing act that Dreamfall Chapters gets exactly right, thanks to adorable dialogue and fantastic voice acting that conveys innocence without ever becoming saccharine."", ""Dreamfall Chapters thus reflects the series' history with its imaginative settings and empathetic characters. There are puzzles to solve and tasks to perform in your time here, but the episode is short on brainteasers: the obstructions you encounter are easily surmounted. The few inventory items you accumulate have intuitive uses and are quickly disposed of, making the first episode as much of an extended tutorial as it is a meandering prologue. Episode one is not short on glitches, however; the game struggles somewhat with its lens flaring, sometimes streaking your screen with distracting lights and colors, and in the game's final and curious scene, I walked right through a door and out of the level. "", ""That final scenario isn't just intriguing from a story perspective: it also puts you in control of an unlikely protagonist with a particularly charming way of interacting with the world. Earlier in the game, you also take control of Kian Alvane, so the world of Arcadia does not go unacknowledged, though a prison is the only setting you get to explore there. Kian's chapter is light on challenge, but the thematic ties to Zoe's story give his section heft regardless: just as Zoe refuses to let her comatose body cage her, so too does Kian embrace the opportunity to flee his cell. Both characters are getting second chances, just as the series itself has risen from the crevasse Dreamfall left behind."", ""The Longest Journey crafted a protracted story arc that featured an equally leisurely opening, but grew into one of the genre's greatest citadels. The first episode's flat narrative structure may not be entirely satisfying, but Dreamfall Chapters' diverse and endearing cast, nuggets of political and personal tensions, and glimmers of the poignancy that made the previous Longest Journey games so memorable make me hopeful for the futures of Stark, Arcadia, and the Dreamtime, wherever those places might take me.""]"Randolph Ramsay,30-Oct-14,Skylanders Trap Team Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/skylanders-trap-team-review/1900-6415932/,8,PS4,"[""The hook for this year's Skylanders entry seems prosaic at first; a speaker on the series' newly designed portal can broadcast the disembodied voices of baddies you defeat in-game, with the portal acting as a prison for your vanquished foes. The intended effect is the reverse of what the series has done so well in its previous entries. Instead of making you believe that a toy has come to life on screen, Skylanders Trap Team wants you to believe that a character on the screen has come to life in the real world. Sure, there are also new real-world figurines to collect in Skylanders Trap Team (such as the eponymous new type of Skylander), but trapping bad guys, having them interact with you, and then using them in battle is the key differentiator for this year's game. Compared to the inventive mix-and-match focus of last year's Swap Force, a talking portal seems almost pedestrian."", ""That is, until you see and hear it in action. Defeat a boss, and (provided you have the right type of elemental trap inserted in your portal) a gigantic, whirling portal appears on screen, sucking in your struggling foe. A flash of light and a rush of sound later, and the voice of your vanquished enemy blares from the portal sitting right in front of you. It's a surprisingly effective gimmick, particularly for the younger set. My five-year-old son was transfixed the first few times it happened, and would engage in conversations with the virtual baddies in their plastic prison. It seems that time and familiarity still hasn't dulled that Skylanders magic."", ""It helps, of course, that the actual gameplay that accompanies this four-year-old toys-to-life franchise is charming, funny, and engaging, throwing lots of different challenges and scenarios at you in an effort to make sure that boredom never has a chance to settle in. Mechanically, the game works as it always has--place a real-world Skylander figurine on the game's included portal, and that character's digital likeness appears on screen. The figurines themselves are, as I've come to expect from the Skylanders franchise, well built and sturdy enough to withstand some knocks from the little ones. The new Skylanders added this year are particularly excellent. These Trap Team figures are about the size of the larger Giants and Swap Force toys of previous years, and all feature some cool transparent weapons or armor. As always, their designs are expressive and appealing, giving you a clear indication of what these little guys will be like when you actually start playing with them on screen. The figure for the crocodilian Trapjaw, for example, has a huge crossbow that he indeed uses to great effect within the game, while the round belly of the bulbous Gusto figurine leads you to believe that he'll have some use for his big gut in battle (which, of course, he does)."", 'The villains that you battle and capture in the game don\'t get their own toy line, however, and their real-world presence is limited to clear plastic ""traps"" that you\'ll need to insert into the Skylanders portal to actually use these baddies as fully controllable characters in your adventures. But what they lack in physical presence they more than make up for in personality, with almost all of the trappable villains being an absolute joy to hear (and play). Some of these characters are simply straight-up funny, with the various quips and comments they utter whilst trapped in your portal sure to bring some laugh-out-loud moments.', ""Not only are these villains affable companions, but they're also capable allies in the field. There's great joy in using a captured villain right after you've defeated him, using attacks that were just used on you against the rest of your foes. The Skylanders Trap Team experience itself is a varied adventure, and whilst it's never truly challenging, its sheer insistence on gameplay variety and its consistently charming presentation makes dull moments few and far between. You'll spend the majority of your time bashing and pummelling your way through enemies using your favored Skylander, but there is seemingly always something different to do to break up the swathes of combat. There are turret sequences, puzzles to solve to open locks, Angry Birds-style mini-games, tower-defense-like challenges, and even a basic card game to compete in, just to name a few. And you perform these activities in some gorgeous locations. From lush and verdant areas where gigantic flowers pop open when you get close to dreamscape locales where fluffy clouds disappear under your feet, there are a lot of cool sights to see during the long campaign."", 'The Skylanders, too, are an equally varied bunch. I used about a dozen different figures (a mix of new and old) when playing Trap Team, and each felt unique to play thanks to their distinct powers and abilities. This is no small part continues to add to that feeling of variety with Skylanders, as switching from one play style to another by simply replacing a character is as easy as ever.', ""It helps if you've previously invested in the Skylanders franchise and have toys from previous generations (they're all compatible with Trap Team). From a financial viewpoint, Skylanders continues to be a potential money sink, particularly if you're coming into the franchise cold. There's a casual pressure to buy more of the real-world toys permeating the entire game, manifested in things like special areas being accessible only to specific elemental types of Trap Team toys, and abilities being unlocked for characters you may not even have. It's never pushed to point of being egregious, but it's there. More problematic for me were the traps in this game. You need to have a trap of the right elemental type to capture and use a villain, and each trap only holds one baddie at a time. To experience some of the best this game has to offer (those excellent, funny, and awesome villains), you're going to have to shell out some extra cash for more traps."", ""The flipside of this is that you have access to the bulk of what Skylanders Trap Team offers using what you get in the basic starter pack alone. And what's there is great--an expansive, funny adventure that appeals to kids while having a surplus of wit and charm that can directly engage older players. I had an excellent time playing co-op with my son in Skylanders Trap Team, but if you don't have a little rugrat, don't let it dissuade you from playing. There's plenty of joy to be had for grown-ups in Trap Team, and more than a few laughs as well."", ' ']"Heidi Kemps,29-Oct-14,Fairy Fencer F Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/fairy-fencer-f-review/1900-6415931/,5,PS3,"['Conceptually, Fairy Fencer F would seem to be a return to the roots of the JRPG genre: a traditionally-styled game with a distinctly Japanese story and aesthetic. Consider the alliteration in Fairy Fencer Fs title, which calls Final Fantasy to mind, or the games development team, which includes composer Nobuo Uematsu and artist Yoshitaka Amano, both of Final Fantasy fame. How unfortunate, then, that Fairy Fencer F is no glorious return to the heyday of the JRPG, but rather a strange, distorted effort, terrifically fun in bursts but plagued by unfortunate technical issues.', ""Fairy Fencer F is the story of young warrior Fang and his fairy partner, Eryn. Fang's excessively cynical and derogatory attitude is likely to grate within mere minutes of starting the game, in which he constantly complains about his new path in life. You see, as the game begins, Fang is told by a shopkeeper that if he is capable of pulling out a strange sword embedded in a rock, he will be granted any wish he desires. All he wants is tasty food (a running obsession that becomes unfunny almost instantly), but, upon yanking out the sword, he is greeted by semi-amnesiac Eryn, told he is a legendary fencer, and asked to free the world's Goddess from her stasis by finding and using Furies, fairies trapped in mythical weapons. Fangs annoyance at having such a burden suddenly dropped on him is understandable, but his continued whininess and apathy is exceptionally irksome. Eryn is more likeable, though the moment another female appears on the scene she goes into (similarly unfunny) jealous-possessive-angry mode."", ""I soon met Tiara, a stuck-up, bratty fencer who harbors a genre-standard terrible secret. She also doubles as an exposition machine, teaching you about the plane beyond reality where the Goddess and evil deity are sealed and giving you a free inn to recover at--when she's not being bossy and condescending. Notice a theme here? The majority of Fairy Fencer F's cast was ripped straight from the pages of Anime Character Tropes You Can Implement Easily. Suffice to say, it takes a fair amount of time before a truly likeable character joins the troupe. Certain party members become more tolerable as time goes on, but it's hard to shake those awful first impressions."", ""Saddled with a party of people I would have liked to punch in the face given the opportunity, I ventured out into the exploration portion of Fairy Fencer F. Much to my relief, exploration and combat are a fair bit more energizing than watching barely-animated character cutouts complain to each other. Combat is turn-based with positioning elements: You and your enemies move around a small field and trade blows with each other, launching area-of-effect spells and utilizing strategic positioning to your advantage. The basics aren't tough to grasp, and as you earn more weapon points in battle, you can customize your stat boosts and add multi-hitting combo capabilities to your characters' strikes."", ""The majority of Fairy Fencer F's cast was ripped straight from the pages of Anime Character Tropes You Can Implement Easily."", 'A neat addition to the formula is the tension gauge: as characters attack and use skills, their tension increases and multiplies the damage they deal. Once tension reaches a certain point, characters can ""fairize,"" transforming into quasi-robot-armored fighters with access to special, super-damaging techniques. However, playing overly defensively--using lots of healing items and spells, retreating from enemies, running away from battle--reduces the tension, and if it dips below a certain point, your combat efficacy will suffer. It\'s a neat system that makes the combat considerably more engaging. It\'s quite fast-paced, as well--the handy L2 button allows you to skip a lot of long-winded combat animations.', 'You can find new dungeons to explore at set points in the story, where you\'ll find some Furies to collect (along with the fairies that inhabit them and/or possibly another fencer). Once you\'ve got a Fury/fairy combo, you can summon the pair to remove one of the binding blades sealing the Goddess and the Vile God. Doing so upgrades the abilities of the fairy, who can then either be assigned to one of your party members or to a dungeon via a process called ""world shaping."" While the stat bonuses fairies can provide to party members are nothing to be sneezed at (and they also level up through combat), world shaping is particularly cool: by assigning a fairy to a dungeon, you also get persistent effects throughout that dungeon, i.e. an experience boost when defeating enemies. This helps make sub-questing less of an out-and-out grind, as it helps tailor some dungeon settings to your liking. The dungeon romping itself is also more engaging than developer Compile Heart\'s previous endeavors, with multi-level layouts and traps.', ""As much as I enjoyed the fundamental combat and dungeon-crawling, it was sometimes difficult for me to enjoy them. In many of the dungeons, Fairy Fencer F suffers from an atrocious and varying framerate, frequently dipping into the sub-20 frames-per-second range. Compile Heart games tend to suffer from this problem, even though the visuals aren't terribly complex, but Fairy Fencer F is particularly awful, to the point where dungeon crawls can lead to motion sickness and headaches."", ""The irritating cast and miserable framerate dips aside, you must also contend with sudden difficulty spikes, recycled environments, and an inconsistent art style. Even the much-touted Yoshitaka Amano and Nobuo Uematsus contributions are disappointing. Amano's contributions are a handful of art concepts, while Uematsu's--or more specifically, Uematsu's team of musicians, the Earthbound Papas--music is uneven; some tracks are absolutely fantastic, while others are entirely unmemorable. Yet there are glimpses of a game that could have been consistently entertaining: combat, when it's not running like a slideshow, is satisfying; there's a lot of customization available to the player; and that butt-rock theme that plays during fairizing is rousing in much the same way Uematsu's Blue Dragon boss music was."", ""Fairy Fencer F has its bright spots, but it's not a game I can heartily recommend--there's too much detritus to dig through in order to get to the fun bits. Compile Heart has announced a sequel, so here's to hoping the move to more recent hardware will solve their games lingering technical problems--and here's to hoping the resulting games will be better as a result.""]"Cameron Woolsey,28-Oct-14,Minecraft Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/minecraft-xbox-one-edition-review/1900-6415930/,9,Xbox One,"[""Minecraft is about the big things, just as much as it favors the small. It's almost impossible to think of Minecraft without envisioning the picturesque structures, from castles to cities, that have been constructed by fans. But Minecraft is also about the minor touches, and sometimes they are what you remember the most--that feeling of awe as you peer across a forest of snow-capped oak, nearly out of sight, the sense of relaxation as you watch the sun set behind a distant mountain, and the sharp intake of breath as you stare deep into an underground mine lit by glowing pools of red-hot lava. Minecraft: Xbox One Edition offers both worlds, large and small, as well as the tools to create your own voxel-constructed paradise."", 'As if climbing a ladder, you start at the bottom and work your way through technology. Spawning a procedurally generated world in Minecraft\'s default survival mode for the first time places you at the bottom rung, where your goal is to seek tools, shelter, and food. The humorous term ""punching trees"" was popularized by Minecraft, as your earliest task involves hammering away at the nearest oak or spruce tree for blocks of wood. From wooden tools and weapons, you soon move to stone, then iron, and then, if you\'re fortunate enough to find it deep in the earth, diamond--not unlike rising through the tiers of the ages of man. Killing animals such as cows or pigs yields food, which staves off hunger, at least for a short while.', ""With the crafting menu, you turn wood into planks and then create a crafting table, the backbone of your Minecraft experience. The crafting table in Minecraft's console versions hasn't changed since the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, for which the options are vastly different compared to the game on PC. Here, all items, from tools to decorations, are available for you to investigate. If you have the material to construct a certain item, it will be fully colored in; otherwise, it remains slightly opaque. On the PC, however, crafting requires a method of trial and error, where you place materials such as wooden planks and sticks on a nine-by-nine board to create new items. On console, you need only have the necessary material in your inventory to craft items. The process is more streamlined, and it prevents you from constantly rubbing several things together in hopes of creating something useful, as well as from looking up crafting recipes online, so you can get to building your blocky empire more quickly."", ""As your knowledge grows, so does the complexity of your projects and the scope of your adventures. A small hut awkwardly cobbled together from blocks of wood and stone is a strange thing to take pride in, and yet it's hard not to feel some accomplishment in its creation. It's small, it's ugly, and there's a good chance the floor is made of dirt, but it's yours. As you learn the odds and ends of creation in Minecraft, that motley shack will be traded in for a cabin deep in the woods or a castle high on a mountaintop where you can survey the land through its windows. Or it could become something else, anything else, as your hand is guided by your imagination, your only limit on what you can accomplish."", ""Minecraft doesn't include a story to follow or missions to complete; your quests are set by you, but the journey can be just as rewarding as those found in other games. There are many sights to see, from the aforementioned sprawling oak forests covered in snow to mucky swamplands with vines and water flecked with green lily pads. Your adventures often carry a similar tone to those found in Fallout or Elder Scrolls games, where a trip through the desert on a hunt for crafting materials is stopped short as a village materializes in your peripheral vision, luring you with villager trade, books to steal, and crops to harvest. In that same desert, you could stumble upon a half-buried temple, where beneath its floor lies secret treasure--as well as an untimely end for brazen travelers who ignore the hidden trap."", ""There are dangers in Minecraft that stalk every dark corner and winding tunnel. At night, vicious creatures roam, threatening you with poisoned fangs and sharp arrows. You can protect yourself with armor and weapons, crafted from materials ranging from leather from slaughtered cows or iron discovered embedded in stone. But even the most seasoned Minecraft veterans can fall prey to the many enemies that haunt the land. Cave spelunking is often quickly ended by an undetected creeper, its blood-curdling hiss the last thing you hear before the inevitable explosion. I have been knocked into a river of lava by a skeleton archer just out of range more often than I care for, once even during the course of this review. The loss is always a bitter pill, but you can always respawn and try to recover any lost items. That is, unless they fall into lava, in which case it's time to start over (I hate those archers so, so much)."", ""It's not expected that you will raise a castle or stretch railways across the land overnight, but Minecraft: Xbox One Edition does well in easing you into the basics as you move along. Enabled by default, tooltips inform you of the uses of the many blocks that surround you. You learn that throwing blocks of sand into a furnace will result in glass or that nether quartz, found in Minecraft's hellish nether, can be crafted into blocks of marble. The in-depth tutorial mode is like a game itself, and it is here that you learn everything that Minecraft is about. The tutorial takes you from learning how to construct small structures and tools to spending gained experience points on enchanting tables to add extra bite to your sword or efficiency to your pickaxe. Minecraft: Xbox One Edition does a fantastic job of blending useful information and advice into its design, allowing you to play the major role in its lessons."", 'Minecraft: Xbox One Edition surpasses the Xbox 360 Edition with cleaner, sharper visuals, and a farther view distance, and it runs at 60 frames per second for complete smoothness.', ""In Minecraft, you don't need to take on adventures alone. Killing skeleton archers drops bones, which you can offer a wolf for the chance that it will become a friendly dog that stays by your side and protects you from enemies. In the wild and bright-green jungles live spotted ocelots, which have a chance to transform into adorable house cats after being fed a fish. But if it's the comfort of fellow humans you seek, you can bring along up to seven friends on Xbox Live to join you on your journeys. Minecraft is an excellent social game, one where ambitious projects no longer seem so laborious when more hands are added to the fold. You can also play with a four-player split screen, where family or friends can tackle any undertaking together."", ""Minecraft on the Xbox One is similar to its PlayStation 4 iteration in both performance and accessibility, with only a few notable differences. Both versions allow you to load saved files from their prior console generation, though your old map is still unfortunately limited to its original size, surrounded by invisible borders. The latest versions are much larger, featuring map sizes roughly 37 times larger by volume than what the prior games boast. However, the size is not unlimited; there is still an impassable wall, but the land within is enormous nonetheless, so it's improbable that you will see and do everything too soon. Minecraft: Xbox One Edition surpasses the Xbox 360 Edition with cleaner, sharper visuals, and a farther view distance, and it runs at 60 frames per second for complete smoothness. The game also includes a creative mode, which allows you to create without the limitations of materials. In this mode, you can fly around the land and construct anything you desire."", ""Where the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions differ the most is downloadable content. Both ports feature multiple skin packs, but they star different characters. On Xbox One, you can purchase packs that allow you to play as the Master Chief or Gordon Freeman, while the PlayStation 4 offers characters from God of War and The Last of Us. Minecraft: Xbox One Edition, however, includes resource packs with theme block textures to match Skyrim, Mass Effect, or Halo, which are not currently available on PlayStation 4 (though I don't expect to see a Halo motif any time soon for Sony's console)."", ""Like the PlayStation 4 version, Minecraft on Xbox One plays second fiddle to the game on PC. The latest iteration of Minecraft on PC includes horses that populate grassy plains, fluffy rabbits, as well as updated flora, and stained glass. However, it's better to view the PC experience not just as a better or different Minecraft but as a vision of what the game will soon become for consoles. Minecraft: Xbox One Edition offers dozens and dozens of hours' worth of entertainment, and as time goes by, updates will include even more to see and animals to interact with. Much like going from a rustic shelter to a statuesque castle, Minecraft: Xbox One Edition will only offer more in time, with future updates adding even more hours to a game already brimming with near-endless potential.""]"Kevin VanOrd,27-Oct-14,Lords of the Fallen Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/lords-of-the-fallen-review/1900-6415929/,8,Xbox One,"['His name is Harkyn. He exits conversation not with a goodbye, but with a gruff ""I don\'t care,"" as if he can barely be bothered to embark on the quest at hand. Harkyn may not be delighted by the adventure he\'s been thrust into, but I can claim no such apathy: Lords of the Fallen is a dark-fantasy pleasure, cut from the same cloth as Dark Souls, yet distinct enough to earn its own spotlight and, perhaps, to earn your affection as well. Harkyn himself is not easy to love, but ultimately, he doesn\'t matter as much as the world he serves and the hammers he swings.', '""World"" might be too generous a word, actually: You spend most of your time in corridors and combat arenas, not gazing onto spacious landscapes. Lords of the Fallen\'s dramatic citadel and hushed monastery are suffering from the invasion of otherworldly flesh-monsters and armored behemoths. Snowy peaks may rise in the distance, but you will not be breathing in their refreshing air. Lords of the Fallen means to choke you with smoke and poison, and to crush you between the stone slabs that line its monumental suspended bridge. The view from this bridge says more about this world than words can convey. Ahead of you lies the gaping maw of a demonic temple hungry for your flesh. The massive chains that connect your destination to the bridge must have taken hundreds of hours to forge. Two colossal soldiers are carved into the mountain on either side of the entrance, warning you of the blood that will soon be spilled. This is Lords of the Fallen: ponderous and unwelcoming. There is no hiding from its dangers.', ' ', 'Unwisely, the game insists on trying to weave a coherent story into these spaces, with each of Harkyn\'s cohorts and various audio logs tossing up a word salad that does little to get you invested. In time, the story begins to make sense, but this cliched tale of the balance between good and evil isn\'t the reason to press on. Instead, it\'s better to let the frozen walkways and giant braziers speak for themselves. You may begin your adventure in a holy sanctuary, but this place seeks to murder you. Consider the titles of the bosses you fight. Guardian. Beast. Champion. Who needs proper names, when ""Annihilator"" gets the point across? These titans and their lesser cohorts have no other purpose than to kill.', ""You fight several such rivals in the first few hours (out of 20 or so) alone, though it takes time to reach the most formidable ones. In the meanwhile, you roam the game's corridors from a third-person perspective, swinging an axe or sword, dodging or blocking incoming attacks, and occasionally calling on the gods of magic to give you a hand when you most need it. It's almost impossible not to draw the obvious comparisons to the Souls series here. An energy meter depletes when you block, roll, and attack, forcing you to closely manage your defenses lest you leave yourself vulnerable to damage. Different melee weapons require different approaches, but Lords of the Fallen gives each of them an authentic sense of weight. Combat requires understanding of how long it takes to swing that humongous greatsword you carry, and how much time that fire-breathing thing you're fighting takes to prepare its next blow."", ""Lords of the Fallen's dramatic citadel and hushed monastery are suffering from the invasion of otherworldly flesh-monsters and armored behemoths."", ""So far, so Dark Souls then. Compared head to head, Souls games are superior to Lords of the Fallen in most given areas: Dark Souls is more mysterious, more difficult, and more diverse, and Lords of the Fallen features no online connectivity. To call Lords of the Fallen a poor man's Dark Souls sells it entirely too short, however. For one, Lords of the Fallen strikes a different kind of tone. It is moody and oppressive, but rarely terrifying; it is a power fantasy, not a heart-wrenching death simulator that rolls deadly boulders at you as if you are a single, miniscule bowling pin. The art style reflects the difference: armor and architecture is less Medieval, chunkier and excessively ornate, mirroring Harkyn's strength and confidence. Lords of the Fallen has a few challenges, but it's rare for you to feel frail or afraid: the game simply isn't hard enough to make your blood boil. That's at least true in the main world; the visits you make to a shadowy and sinister otherworld are more frightening."", ""Those visits bring great reward if you can conquer the darkness. Traversing this otherworld is like exploring a foggy dessert during the witching hour: you can barely see further than the tip of your blade, which make the occasional glimpse of light a true ray of hope. There is tribulation to undergo, however, before you reach possible treasure. Your steps into the beyond lead you first to easily-dispatched knights and mutants, which require only that you put the finicky targeting system to good use. Soon, though, you could encounter a rolling fire demon whose flaming carapace will quickly scorch your flesh. Your introduction to this dimension is a limited one, fortunately: you open a few treasure chests in the hope of finding a rune for upgrading your equipment, a new armor set, or an item that temporarily protects you from poison, and then return to the land of women and men. You reach this realm by entering portals that only unlock when you have killed some unknown beast. You will come to identify an available nearby portal by the crackles and creaks it makes as it opens, as if it's made of ancient tendons that haven't often had a chance to stretch."", ""The grind to level up is minimal, and while death is likely, it's not frequent enough to elicit heartache. When you perish, you leave behind your ghost and (usually) revive at whichever ruby crystal you last saved at. Your ghost contains all the experience you have accumulated since the prior death, but it doesn't remain forever, so it's in your best interests to go retrieve it, and to be timely about it, at least in the early hours. Every fallen enemy will have respawned after your death, but you will be armed with the knowledge of what lies ahead of you. You will also be armed with some spells and a gauntlet that shoots out magic projectiles, spews fire, and helps open new pathways. Selecting and casting spells is a matter of pressing or holding a button: there's no need to switch from a dagger to a wand if you want to punch a demon in the groin with your quake skill. There are no bows and arrows in Lords of the Fallen: it's all swords and sorcery. You can engorge on magic when leveling up and make quick work of the three-legged freak known as the infiltrator if you play your cards right. I prefer the heaviest killing tools, however, coming close enough to my foes to smell their breath."", 'You will probably not sob when your ghost expires and you leave behind all your experience. Experience can be regained easily, and in the last several hours, you accumulate too little experience from killing enemies to mind the loss. The bosses may parade around their ominous titles and roar with indignance, but most of them are more bark than bite: if you have Souls experience, many will go down on the first attempt. The challenge ramps up nicely during the lead-up to the final showdown, however, beginning with a double-boss encounter that signals trouble to come.', 'The greatest challenge Lords of the Fallen provides isn\'t a welcome one: it\'s easy to lose yourself in the crypts and corridors, unsure of where the game means for you to go. Every region cleverly connects with others, and unlocking a new door often leads you to a familiar area, provoking cries of ""Eureka!"" That interconnectedness can also be a burden, however, particularly when a loading screen is there to interrupt your travels. Dark Souls has no quest log, yet smartly uses its visual diversity and clear environmental gating to direct you. Lords of the Fallen tells you what you must do, but some areas are so circuitous and same-ish, and some entrances so subtle, that the game can become aimless. Backtracking is sometimes required, so you may not know where the right path lies.', 'Intriguing subtleties ultimately overcome any resulting tedium, however. You choose whether to save a man\'s life by amputating his arm--and then, whether to offer him a potion to help heal the wound you dealt him. Offering the potion diminishes your available (and replenishable) health draught count by one, but I was never sure if I had earned any reward for allowing him to live. Soon afterwards, I convinced a fellow warrior to spare a monk\'s life; I\'m not sure there were any repercussions, but I was at least content to know that Harkyn was not always the vile executioner others insisted he was. Later, you get to make a more interesting life-or-death decision, and in at least one case, can circumvent danger entirely. Lords of the Fallen has a brief brush with mystery in these circumstances, inspiring ""what if"" quandaries. What if I ignore the order to request a group of deserters? What if I go around the monster rather than meet it head-on? Should there be a Lords of the Fallen 2, I hope for more what-ifs, and more-meaningful consequences to accompany them.', 'The bosses may parade around their ominous titles and roar with indignance, but most of them are more bark than bite.', ' ', ""Superficially, you could call Lords of the Fallen a Souls game for the meek and the uninitiated. But it earns more respect than such a flippant description. Lords of the Fallen isn't about the game that it isn't, but the game that it is. It's about the ghoulish blacksmith, his glowing eyes, and the long tufts of stiff hair that rise from his scalp. It's about the crunches of iron against bone when your hammer finds its mark. It's about taking in new sights and sounds, and about finding new ways to travel to old ones. It's about that suspended bridge, the monuments that guard it, and the creatures waiting within. Harkyn may have no use for these places, but there are riches inside nonetheless.""]"Peter Brown,27-Oct-14,Sunset Overdrive Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sunset-overdrive-review/1900-6415928/,8,Xbox One,"[""If you're worn out on games with drab palettes and dramatic characters, then Sunset Overdrive is just the game you need to lift your spirits. It's dripping with color and upbeat personality, and its cast is filled with comical caricatures. Sure, its dialogue is vulgar and absurd, but unlike so many games that attempt to be edgy, Sunset Overdrive makes its quips feel natural rather than forced. It never takes itself too seriously, which in this case, is a good thing. It's also a blast to play thanks to it's movement system and over-the-top weapons. It's a liberating game that trades in rules and drama for freedom and pure unadulterated enjoyment, and Sunset Overdrive never pretends to be anything but an excuse to swear like a sailor, jump off of a skyscraper, and blow up a gang of monsters."", ""As you'd expect, an absurd game like Sunset Overdrive features an equally absurd plot. It's the end of days after the evil energy drink corporation, Fizzco, poisoned the citizens of Sunset City, turning them into violent rage beasts known as OD. On one hand, that means you need to fight your way out of the city, on the other hand, that means you get to fight your way out of the city. As a janitor that's been taken advantage of by Sunset's hedonistic jerks in the past, it's finally your turn dish out the pain, and you get to do it with an over-the-top selection of powerful and ridiculous weaponry."", ""Before your crusade kicks off, you create a character of your choosing using the character customization system. There's a great variety of options to choose from, but should you grow bored with your character, you're free to go back to the drawing board at any time and revise your appearance. Over the course of your journey, you team up with small factions of survivors to devise your escape plan, and along the way, you go toe to toe with hundreds of monsters, Fizzco robots, and enemy humans known as scabs. Each faction you fight alongside sticks to a theme: there are the lazy, rich, preppy kids, a scout troop, and a gang of LARPers, to name a few. Though the factions' characterizations are slightly mocking and exploitative of the groups they represent, there are also plenty of times when representatives from each group call out and mock the stereotypes that are so often applied to them, striking a respectful balance."", ""Make no mistake, however: Sunset Overdrive is immature on all fronts. Nearly every character swears up a storm, dropping f-bombs like it's going out of style. Thankfully, unlike many games that take this approach, their foul language feels natural and it reinforces the brash attitude that permeates the game. Largely, the voice actors behind the game's cast do a commendable job of selling their roles. You'd think that everything would be colored by a hint of doom and gloom given the situation at hand, but the survivors you meet seem to take it in stride, giving the game a lighthearted and irreverent quality that's rather uplifting."", ""Sunset Overdrive is one of the best looking games on the Xbox One, both on a technical and artistic level. The city itself is large, dense with buildings and artifacts, with plenty of variation in architectural style. Everything's coated in a bright, saturated coat of paint, giving the game a cartoonish quality that's easy to love. When you're in the midst of battle, sometimes with what seems like a hundred enemies, the screen fills with explosions, bursts of lightning, and occasionally bright green ooze. Despite all of the chaos on screen, the frame rate remains rock solid. Sunset Overdrive isn't meant to look realistic, but that doesn't disqualify it as a top contender for the best looking Xbox One game. It's simply beautiful to behold."", ""Of course, when you're zipping across town, you're going to miss a few of the finer details, but you'll be having too much fun to care. One of Sunset Overdrive's primary delights is its mobility system, which is loose and flexible in the name of enjoyment. Nearly every object and surface is an opportunity to gain ground, which makes it easy to travel great distances with speed and grace. You can grind along most objects, including telephone lines, ledges, handrails, and the like. Cars, awnings, and exhaust ducts act as trampolines that send you skyward, allowing you to work your way up and over buildings with ease. You can also wall-run indefinitely and, eventually, dash in mid-air and run atop bodies of water."", ""The only downside to the emphasis on movement is that if you find yourself standing in place in the middle of combat, you're going to be punished. It's easy to become overwhelmed by dozens of enemies at once if you're fighting while stationary, and they can quickly whittle away your health. There are times when your instincts tell you to fight rather than flee, but despite your best intentions, this is rarely the right decision."", 'Stringing movements together not only gets you to your destination safely and quickly, but it exemplifies what Sunset Overdrive is all about. Sometimes you slightly miss your target, but that\'s OK, because the game\'s very forgiving when it comes to timing and aiming. Once you get the hang of each move, you can free-run from one end of the city to another without ever touching the ground. The more tricks you use, the more style points you earn. As you fill up your style gauge, you activate elemental and stat boosts that make you more effective in battle. These ""Amps"" can be applied to you or your weapons, and are purchased with collectibles that are strewn throughout Sunset City. Similar to the open world game Crackdown, you have to explore every nook and cranny of the city to find them, but you can make it easier on yourself by purchasing maps for each type of collectible.', 'Sunset Overdrive never pretends to be anything but an excuse to swear like a sailor, jump off of a skyscraper, and blow up a gang of monsters.', ""As you perform certain actions, such as grinding, using automatic weapons, and air dashing, you earn badges that can be traded in for overdrives. Overdrives are another form of upgrade, which are similar to amps, but they're earned a different way. They can be applied to your character to increase style-point generation, boost weapon strength, or grant you health augmentations. Between Amps and Overdrives, there are a seemingly endless number of ways to upgrade your character and remix their strengths. If you want to explore the full range of options, you're going to spend a lot of time gathering collectibles, and even more time generating badges to unlock the best Overdrives."", ""Like the movement system, Sunset Overdrive's weapons are wild and varied enough to keep you entertained well beyond the end of the main mission path. Unlocking some weapons requires an absurd amount of the game's energy drink currency to unlock, and your best bet to earn them is to tackle the large selection of side missions, or to replay old missions for better rankings. You take aim with the likes of an acid sprinkler, a bowling ball cannon, an explosive teddy bear launcher, and a gun that bombards enemies with fireworks and illusionary Chinese dragons. Sometimes it's hard to choose which weapons to bring into battle, not because you need specific equipment, but because there are so many great options to choose from."", ""Unfortunately, one of the few issues with the game is its selection of mission types. For a while, it feels like all you're doing are fetch quests. Someone needs supplies and they need you to go get them. It definitely helps that moving and shooting are so fun, but you still pine for something different after the dozenth fetch quest in a row. Give it time, however, and you'll eventually discover a wide variety of challenges, including a hefty dose of traversal challenges and combat scenarios to keep you busy and beef up your resources."", ""There are also more than a few great boss battles that challenge your ability to act quickly and move effectively, and these are some of the best moments in the game. Just when you think you're on the verge of boredom, an over-the-top mission appears, reigniting your enthusiasm. If you've always dreamed of taking on a massive inflatable mascot, similar to the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man from Ghostbusters, there's a boss battle for that. Maybe you've wanted to chase a train by grinding on rails, or you have a burning desire to ride on the back of a massive dragon that's winding through a vast cityscape. It's not that there's no fun to be had in Sunset Overdrive's typical missions, but the imaginative and surprising boss fights provide an enjoyable and taxing challenge."", ""You can freely replay any mission at a moment's notice, but eventually you'll want to jump online and screw around Sunset City with your friends. Hop into the Chaos Squad booths around the map, and you and a team of seven other warriors can tackle horde-like throngs of enemies, defend outposts, and put your traversal skills to the test. Sunset Overdrive emphasizes cooperation, but team members are awarded for their individual performance. Throughout the course of the game, you fight alongside computer-controlled warriors, but they're mostly useless fodder. In Chaos Squad, you're working with other tricked out players that are capable of zipping to-and-fro with a cache of arms at the ready. It feels like you're part of a stylish, amoral Justice League. Unfortunately, the difficulty of co-up doesn't scale based on the number of players in your party. With fewer than eight people, some Chaos Squad challenges are simply too hard; with fewer than four, you're almost always asking for trouble."", ' ', ""Insomniac Games has crafted an excellent game in Sunset Overdrive. It's not without a few niggling issues, but you'll be too busy enjoying yourself to care. You can compare it to games like Crackdown, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, and Ratchet and Clank, but by combining the best elements of those games into a single package and injecting it with an anything goes, rock and roll attitude, you'll never think of it as anything but a singular achievement that stands tall on its own merits.

The sequel is a grand adventure, a far cry from the claustrophobic tunnels of its predecessor's excellent first-person, tile-based dungeon-crawling revival. And while the suffocating atmosphere of the franchise's first entry has been diluted by a focus on exploration rather than escape, its mechanics and well-crafted content have flourished and been improved in almost every way. Legend of Grimrock II is a logical and brilliantly executed next step for the series, exhibiting slight symptoms of too much freedom, but never stumbling for long."", ""Grimrock II has little to do with the mountain peak in the game's title; rather, it serves as reassurance that the formula defined decades ago, and modernized in the original Grimrock, still elegantly drives the experience. You fashion a party of adventurers with classic Dungeons & Dragons character trappings and step through unexplored three-dimensional terrain one tile at a time. Along the way, you acquire armor, weapons, and artifacts of increasing prowess, outfitting each of your characters to do real-time battle against a bestiary of monstrous creatures. You trigger fatally hidden traps, avoid the obvious ones, and search for vital clues to unlock gates and doorways, while solving riddles and puzzles in a quest for answers to larger mysteries and the almighty pursuit of power itself."", 'Legend of Grimrock II shirks the longstanding reliance on subterranean labyrinths that have so-well suited the genre; instead, it pulls a new foursome of characters to the Isle of Nex, and the welcome addition of outdoor locales. From the temperate woodlands of Twigroot Forest to the noxious vapors of Keelbreach Bog, each environment carries a unique personality, and together they create a more diverse setting than the original\'s endless halls of stone and darkness. Of course, thousands of steps are still waiting to be taken in decrepit dungeons and tight tunnels, but the promise of returning to the fresh air of the surface alleviates the impenetrable gloom of underground life. Even returning to an open sky of a pitch black night--thanks to the great addition of a day and night cycle--feels like a safe haven from the skittering terrors that roam the chasms below.""', ""The openness of the island setting is mirrored in the game's navigation. Shortly after your arrival on Nex, you're free to traverse nearly anywhere you can see, assuming you can unlock the barriers to entry and survive your own curiosity. To that point, there's a naural sense of progression in Grimrock II: it gently guides you through each new zone without spelling out an optimal order for visiting them. Should you somehow decipher the means to wander into territory too dangerous for your fledgling skills, that gentle hand becomes a clenched fist, ready to immediately bludgeon your party for its foolhardiness--but the option exists, and that non-linearity is refreshing."", 'Returning to an open sky in a pitch black night--thanks to the great addition of a day and night cycle--feels like a safe haven from the skittering terrors that roam the chasms below.', 'Unfortunately, that freedom of choice and ambiguous direction is where Grimrock II briefly falters. Much of the adventure hinges on the collection of scattered MacGuffins, conveniently spaced and designed to require the exploration of every area in order to chase them all down. In fact, the journey from your shipwrecked landing to the heart of the mystery is largely devoid of overarching narrative until the climax. What little references there are to a grander scheme are delivered in coy notes from an unknown master of this undiscovered island.', ""It's understandable that a focused narrative pushing you from one area to the next might hamper your ability to freely navigate the isle, but the chosen alternative is a nearly blind journey requiring a herculean effort and an enormous amount of good faith that it's going to pay off in the end--which it thankfully does. Instead, the real story takeaway is found in the immaculately designed riddles, puzzles, and moments of sometimes-not-so-near fatal choice that punctuate every step of the adventure."", ""Developer Almost Human has deftly crafted dozens of bite-sized, standalone engagements that are often vague, frequently complex, and always clever. And it's in these moments, when you're stuck wondering how exactly the provided clues don't point to the seemingly obvious conclusion, that you might truly appreciate the openness of a world that allows you to go off and perform some other task while you let all the elements of a particularly devious obstacle simmer in the back of your mind."", ""Overcoming the many vague riddles in Legend of Grimrock II is occasionally grueling, but to Almost Human's great credit, the answers are nearly always rooted in logic or interpretation, rather than finding some minute trigger on a wall. Oh, there are many secrets on Nex that are only uncovered with a keen eye, say, scrutinizing a sea of stone for the smallest switch, but these instances are almost exclusively tied to superfluous loot rather than vital game progression."", ""The vein of thoughtful improvement running through Legend of Grimrock II may be most apparent in its intricately designed quandaries, but it snakes through even the most basic elements of the franchise. Character creation, the cornerstone of the dungeon-crawling experience, exhibits a comparable leap forward. Where the original Grimrock opted for a trifecta of class selections--Fighter, Rogue, and Mage--the second offering builds on that trinity, filling the spaces between with new and unique roles. Choose to crush monsters through the Barbarian's brute force, strike a balance between marshal and mystical arts with a Battlemage, or brew life-saving concoctions with collected herbs as an Alchemist. All are viable additions to a budding party, though in practice, some classes are clearly more beneficial than others."", 'The real story takeaway is found in the immaculately designed riddles, puzzles, and moments of sometimes-not-so-near fatal choice that punctuate every step of the adventure.', ""In another sly wink poking fun at the tropes of the genre, there's even a Farmer class, which excels in absolutely nothing you'd want in an adventurer and gains experience not by killing enemies but by eating food. It's these small touches of playful meta--for example, some races gain hidden statistical benefits after ingesting their preferred foods, and the new Ratling race has a special affinity for cheese--that paint Grimrock II as a creation that's totally comfortable in its own skin while still true to the dungeon crawling mantle of yore."", ""But while an old-school spirit might power the core, the vessel is a more modern, expanded take on the experience than even the original Grimrock had to offer. The addition of weapon-specific special attacks adds a welcome layer of depth to combat; by drawing from your characters' energy pools, you're able to trigger devastating blows with titanic axes, or launch a flurry of slashes with a sabre. Moreover, the overhauled spell casting system allows you to quickly swipe across runes to prime a spell, replacing the cumbersome need to click each individual one. Now you can engage in combat that is fluid and interactive, rather than just repeatedly hacking at something until one of you squeals and collapses."", ""Better still, when paired with the active and passive bonuses of available skills and traits, each character can potentially attain enough unique purpose that fights are often elevated from slugfests to battles of timing, positioning, and resourcefulness. The appointed leader of my party, Arielle the Knight, started as the tough-as-nails tank, but somewhere during my 30-hour adventure she learned to dual-wield rune-adorned scimitars, backstabbing unsuspecting enemies in her impractically bulky armor. Thanks to the untethered skill system, she did it all, and you're free to similarly build any class in any direction you choose."", ""Combat in Grimrock II is a more refined, empowering, and choice-centric part of the experience this time around, and with good reason: The beasts that inhabit the Isle of Nex are a much more formidable breed. Mainstay monsters that have adorned the darkened hallways of grid-based crawlers for years are well-represented: giant spiders, rats, ogres, and the undead. But new to the fray are creatures that, like your characters, carry their own functional skillsets. The giant toads roaming the bog may seem straightforward, but when one leaps across several tiles, landing behind your party, lashing out with its sticky tongue and pulling your characters' weapons out of their hands, the encounter shifts dramatically in its favor. Wispy elementals patrol the forests and press their attacks, unfazed by conventional weapons and spells, and leaving you helplessly searching for a vulnerability of some kind. And amethyst-hued cycloptic floating squid-beasts spew blinding ink from both ends, disgustingly enough, in the jewel-encrusted mines beneath the surface of Nex."", 'These functional additions to the bestiary are fairly indicative of what you should expect from Legend of Grimrock II: A well-established foundation revisited and excellently enhanced in the years between releases. Nearly every aspect of this dense adventure has been touched in a positive way, with none of the clutter that often accompanies second-act offerings that try to cram too much in. And despite the lack of narrative, Grimrock II is an outstanding second trip to the nostalgia well. It synthesizes the key elements that made the first game great, improves upon them in intriguing and powerful ways, and uses that as a platform for designing and launching more of the same great content.', 'Legend of Grimrock II is similar to one of its many well-designed riddles: While solving it may be a long, arduous process, approaching each obstacle with newfound understanding and hearing the victorious click of gears finally turning gives you a feeling of profound pride and accomplishment. Legend of Grimrock II is another glorious glimpse of the past, a window to a genre dead and buried and brought back to life with care and respect, and I urge you to peek through it.']"Justin Clark,24-Oct-14,Neverending Nightmares Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/neverending-nightmares-review/1900-6415927/,7,PC,"[""There's an elite brand of horror that, even in these glory days when players are drowning in utterly terrifying interactive experiences, is rare to see, and harder to pull off, and that is the horror of the self. That is, the terror that comes not from a malignant, malicious invader that must be put down, but from witnessing perversions and desecrations beyond imagining, and realizing you're responsible for such terror, and you have to forever change to keep it at bay. This is the territory that Silent Hill 2 occupies, and it's one of only a few games to get it exactly right."", ""Neverending Nightmares is a solemn attempt to flourish in that territory, and it has the right ideas. It's the story of a young man named Thomas who is stuck in a seemingly eternal Inception-style loop of visceral Edward Gorey nightmares. His own house is slowly overtaken by living, ominous shadows and dolls with frozen smiles whose eyes follow him when he walks by. He finds himself in an asylum overrun by straight-jacketed cannibals and with haphazardly-piled mutilated dead in the hallways. Dead women rain from the sky in a cemetery while birds feed on the corpses. There are common elements in each scenario, but the omnipresent one is the ephemeral specter of a black-haired girl. The girl takes many forms: sister, wife, psychiatrist, daughter, china doll, bride, and, not least of all, bloody, knife-wielding murderwoman. She is both the reason to press on and the reason to want to escape every nightmare Thomas finds himself in. But you don't escape. You simply... persist."", ""The devil is quite literally in the details in Neverending Nightmares. As you explore, a room might be little more than a bunch of family paintings, or a benign toy chest in a corner, or a sterile bathroom. Returning to that same room later, the wallpaper might have turned into deathly skulls, or the expression on the dolls face turned to terror; random blood stains mightve appeared, or you might hear random whispers, crying, and screams off in the distance. When Neverending Nightmares is at its best, its a sort of hellish Gone Home, where opening a new door means falling forever, having your Achilles tendons slashed, ripping out your own veins like string cheese; and making progress towards a new nightmare is indistinguishable from abject failure until you notice the change in the air, a different set of taunting voices. It's a perfect storm of fear: You are free to explore yet claustrophobically trapped, all at once."", ""This dichotomy would create a distressing combination even if movement werent so restricted. Thomas' regular gait when walking is a limping shuffle that makes simple walks down a hallway feel like roaming 40 years in a desert. Yes, you have the ability to run, but Thomas apparently has the stamina of a chain-smoker with one lung, and you can get maybe five seconds of sprinting out of him before hes exhausted. It adds a nice layer of tension to the game's many terrifying chases, but when it takes forever to get from point A to B, tension turns into flat annoyance."", ""The monotony isn't helped by the fact that Neverending Nightmares is such a sparse game. After knowing what's scattered around each environment, you can go for stretches where youre walking in and out of doors with nothing happening, nothing having changed, and with nothing new to interact with. The intent seems to be to give the player breathing room before going in for the scare, but it feels more artificial. Bad dreams typically aren't characterized by moments of lukewarm emptiness, and the fact that there are many here distracts."", 'What dreams do have, however, is abstraction, and Neverending Nightmares excels here. The game speaks in the broken dream language of trauma and internalized pain like few games do, and the facts of Thomas continually murdering himself, being marauded by defective babies, or seeing the girl dead in so many configurations are meant to walk the careful line between subtext and text. You are meant to put the pieces together, and the more the game feeds you on the far extremes of violence and sadness, the less it makes sense. Are you watching a man who killed a loved one and can no longer rest? Are you watching a brother stuck in purgatory for attempting suicide? Are you seeing the aftereffects of a parent grieving a dead child? The emotions are clearly represented: Fear, grief, surrender, self-loathing, and doubt.', ""What those emotions are in aid of is the pertinent question, and it's a haunting one, which the game's multiple endings do muddled work in answering, to both the games benefit and detriment. You walk away with heady questions about what youve played. What you might not come away with is satisfaction. Despite being only a one-to-two- hour game, it feels like a long way to get to either of the three finish lines; even trying for a second ending feels like work, and at least one of the endings puts far too easy a cap on what came before to feel true to the preceding hour."", 'And yet, having slept on it, I find myself obsessing over the questions raised, and the imagery foisted upon me by the encroaching darkness, than I have with any game in recent memory. Its frustrations are many, but they are not what sticks in the mind after its done. Neverending Nightmares might be a dream only worth taking once, but once is all it needs to work its ill upon you.']"Nick Capozzoli,23-Oct-14,Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/civilization-beyond-earth-review/1900-6415923/,7,PC,"['I am looking at the number 585. It\'s below the ""hours played"" tab for my copy of Civilization V and I...well, I\'m not sure I want to dwell on that figure. But I can tell you that for all those hours, I\'ve only actually seen a single session with the history-based strategy game through to completion. I\'m an absentee world leader: present for my peoples\' first fumbling steps towards agriculture, gone again somewhere between the invention of the compass and the internal combustion engine. I get into these obsessive restarting loops, curious just to see what new permutation the game\'s map-making algorithms spit out. Eventually I\'ll nestle a few defensible cities into the mountainside, churn through tech advancements until I can fuss over cute little janissaries or hussar units like they\'re collectible figurines. Then, in a sudden fit of self-loathing, I\'ll wipe the board clean. It\'s wonderful, soul-sucking entertainment.', ""Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth shifts the series' brand of turn-based discovery and conquest off-planet, and the sci-fi setting puts a slick, chrome sheen on my old neurosis. But Beyond Earth also calcifies much of Civilization V's vocabulary and play arc. You still situate your capital city, and click it to designate the production of military units or workers that can spruce up your immediate surroundings. You still unlock new technologies and cultural policies that ensure a steady drip of upgrades and benefits. There are the familiar icons for production, food, and culture to illustrate the quantified output of your cities, and a new one, energy, is a reasonable enough stand-in for currency--its icon even looks a bit like a golden coin to ease you into the transition. So despite the new trappings, it's simple enough to slide back into routine. Create, explore, and expand--or, if you're like me, create, explore, quit, and create again."", ""There are a few welcome touch-ups to smooth over Civilization's old edges, and they first appear in pregame as a series of decisions to make prior to starting your bid for global domination. A first step can be taken towards generating energy, science, culture, et alia, and you can opt to begin the game with a military unit, or a clinic if you'd prefer. There's more freedom afforded when picking out which parcel of land to found your first city on, and there's even a perk that reveals the outlines of the world's land masses. So much for my incessant restarting, then--all things considered, Beyond Earth seems to output viable starting situations more reliably than its predecessors."", 'But viable doesn\'t necessarily mean welcoming--this is an alien planet, after all, and colonizing it is going to beget some unfortunate learning experiences on the behaviors of local wildlife as part of due course. Maybe those lessons will come from the sandworm churning up your freshly tilled farmland a few tiles from your capital and consuming any trade expedition you send in its general direction. Or maybe from the creature that\'s three-quarters mandible, just kind-of loitering ominously offshore. Aliens play the role of the barbarian tribes from the last few Civilization games, as an entity that\'s not exactly ""in it to win it."" But they\'ll mess with your early game plans all the same, utilizing better cunning and more imposing units than their old club-wielding counterparts. Even Beyond Earth\'s loan translations of the previous entries\' forests, mountains, and livestock feel suitably threatening here. A toxic miasma coats about a third of the surface of any map, damaging human units and healing aliens. And while natural wonders are conspicuously absent--robbing players of part of the draw of exploring a new planet--the varied terrain is full of curious features like resource pods, ruins and alien skeletons to seek out. The land is pock-marked with craters and chasms, the grasslands have a sickly cast to them, and I\'m still trying to get comfortable with the idea of constructing a paddock for giant beetles.', 'But you\'re probably going to have to manifest some destiny sooner or later, because advancement in Beyond Earth necessitates subscription to a belief system and two of the three available are less than concerned with preserving indigenous species. So-called affinities push your development towards divergent goals: Purity, Supremacy, or Harmony. It\'s a choice between Terran, Protoss, or Zerg, really. Purity marks a civilization that concerns itself with recreating the comforts of home and preserving humanity in a more-or-less recognizable state. Supremacy is a technocratic zealotry that comes with all the haughtiness you\'d expect--really, its units bear names like ""Educator"" and ""Prophet."" Harmony is there for us Truffula Tree-huggers, and since it lets you ride an alien like a horse and sic giant space katydids on your enemy\'s cities, I\'d say it\'s the clear choice for the discerning Fremen. Interestingly, the text that accompanies each new affinity level shifts in tone along with the stage of the game, starting with earnest, innocent theorizing and gradually taking on a more hawkish, proselytizing inflection as the players start jockeying for position near the home stretch.', 'The Civilization series portrays a history that\'s not of people, but rather ""the State."" That is to say, you don\'t play as Ghandi, or Gengis Kahn: you play as India, or Mongolia, as well as a vision of those peoples united in a singular, millennia-spanning focus on besting all other nations. Beyond Earth expands upon this cult of the state, drawing the series\' diverse cast of historical cultures into eight broad, continental coalitions, and rescinding the roles that individual artists, engineers, and scientists had been enjoying in Civilization V. The loss of the latter means a less celebratory, more overtly martial sort of strategy game, and Im not keen on this step backwards towards the series competitive, board game roots. Its echoed in the relative parity of the eight coalitions, which lack the color and diversity of play-styles that Civ V furnished so adeptly. In Beyond Earths eight-person multiplayer (local or online), the terms have never been so even, but some of the fascination went out the door with the asymmetry.', 'Affinities push your development towards divergent goals: Purity, Supremacy, or Harmony.', 'It\'s a brave new world, with new lands to chart, resources to harvest, and goals to pursue. But it\'s also as cynical as the old one, where most actions serve competitive ends, and even the most cooperative and well-maintained alliances will be shattered by necessity towards game\'s end. To Civilization, the State is an entity that acts on only the basest and most selfish of desires--consume, grow, and propagate. That\'s become increasingly ironic, as Beyond Earth\'s web of discoverable technologies introduces high-minded and esoteric futurisms like ""Human Idealism"" and ""Artificial Evolution."" A little barbarism was to be expected back when Civilization\'s tech tree was largely given over to simply escaping the Dark Ages. But Beyond Earth suggests--and perhaps not wrongly--that advancements like euthenics or microrobotics are ultimately just the new sticks we\'ll use to club each other over the head.', 'Beyond Earth\'s operatic opening short tells the story of a young female colonist who bears at least some superficial resemblance to National Geographic\'s famous ""Afghan Girl."" But it\'s otherwise hard to get a sense of what these people look like, or what their culture entails beyond that brief cinematic glimpse, because only the military gets treated to any real illustration in the game proper. Gone are the works of art, music, and writing that helped to redefine the cultural victory in Civilization V, pared back to an abstract number that\'s ultimately used towards more aggressive ends. World wonders do reprise their role as larger constructive undertakings, but the bonuses they proffer feel tepid and same-ish this time around. There are quests, though--a first for Civilization. In practice, they\'re a limited set of binary prompts with a light influence on your direction of progress, but they nevertheless lend some helpful narrative context to the action, and they can branch in unexpected ways. A newly founded independent outpost might turn out to be performing questionable experiments on its colonists, perhaps, or a plant brought along on the journey to the new world might take root and begin overriding the local flora.', ""In at least one case, you're tasked with spying on a particular city belonging to a rival civ. It's a subtle guiding of the eyes towards Beyond Earth's enhanced spy system, which requires regular management of a small team that can siphon energy, science, or units from other cities in addition to the last game's tech thievery and intel thievery. Successful operations increase the intrigue rating for a city, ostensibly granting access to higher-tier abilities like fomenting rebellion or planting a bomb, but in practice it seems difficult to ever reach those levels. Relocating a spy to one's own city might be too reliable a means of reducing your intrigue levels when you see them spiking."", 'Gone are the works of art, music, and writing that helped to redefine the cultural victory in Civilization V.', ""But absent a more subversive method of dealing with your foes, there's always old-fashioned battle. Military units still hold sway over most of the game space, trading turn-based fire between the hexagonal parcels of land and besieging cities. They fall back on Civilization's traditional archetypes: melee, ranged, cavalry, and siege, even as their outward appearances morphs from astronauts with rifles and moon rovers to bipedal robots and giant kaiju. The ones you field depend on your progression towards one of the three affinities, and in a welcome bit of streamlining, the upgrades get rolled out automatically with each new level--no more paying for promotions for each individual unit. Better still, a new, similarly tiled orbital layer plays host to satellites which can be launched for quick industrial bonuses, or support coverage for your armies in the field."", ""Beyond Earth's combat suffers from some balance issues though, and that's curious for a game that leans so heavily on proven systems. Cities are comically easy to take--most melee units fare much better at city capturing, and you can often halve a city's defenses in a single attack--resulting in situations where cities tediously trade ownership turn after turn. The fragility extends to the units themselves, many of which die in a single hit. By consequence, a small standing army is less tenable than it was back on Earth, and I find myself less invested in the fate of any one unit when it can be snuffed out by an orbital strike at any given moment."", 'I am finding that I play more games through to completion in Beyond Earth. In inverse of my experience with Civilization V, my favorite part might be the ending, where a civ has to lay its cards face-up in a bid for one of the five methods of victory, and any semblance of ""civilization"" goes out the window as everyone else tries to drag them back down like the proverbial crabs in the bucket. The three affinity-specific victories dont play out all that differently, nor does a fourth concerned with making contact with an unseen, advanced alien race. Each entails researching a few specific technologies, then designating your cities to produce a structure or two that sometimes have minor idiosyncrasies, like consuming your surplus energy each turn. But the path to victory is more elegantly interwoven with the early and middle game this time around, and of course, global domination, ever the crude way out, remains as tempting as ever when another world leader shows up uninvited to talk some smack. The more things change, the more they stay the same, then; a journey to a planet halfway across the universe reaffirming the draw of the same old creature comforts--a plot of land, and just one more turn.']"Britton Peele,18-Sep-14,Roundabout Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/roundabout-review/1900-6415876/,8,PC,"[""Being a limousine driver isn't an easy gig. You've always got to worry about people running in the street, cars falling from the sky and, of course, what hat you're going to put on your vehicle. But most importantly, how do you differentiate yourself? Georgio Ramos decided to make her mark on the exciting world of limo driving by becoming the world's foremost revolving chauffeur. But the colorful action game Roundabout isn't just about her journey to fame. It's a story in which love, drugs, revenge, anarchy and more all come together to form one of the most delightfully absurd games in recent memory."", ""If you really want to boil it down, Roundabout is what you get when you throw Crazy Taxi, Tony Hawk, Kuru Kuru Kururin, and an amateur filmmaker with a camera and a love for cheesy full-motion video games into a pot. As Georgio, you control an always-rotating limousine through the open streets of Roundabout city. You can't control the speed of the rotation, and you can only rarely affect its direction, so maneuvering around the streets requires precise timing."", ""As you move through the game's open world, you accept missions by picking up passengers. Every time you pick someone up you are treated to a unique and cheesy full-motion video sequence that contributes to the game's story. The sequences encapsulate Roundabout's tone: They're ridiculous, they don't take themselves seriously, and they look like they could have been made in a garage. The acting in each is deliberately amateur, rather than an attempt to meet big Hollywood's exacting standards. Such scenes are what might result from a group of friends getting together to make a dumb and campy film with a 1970s feel. Google the actors' names, and you find that the actors mostly a bunch of video game industry acquaintances, which might explain the clips' goofy and good-natured tone."", ""Even if you were to find these videos grating, they are easily skipped at the tap of a button. But to do so would be a mistake, as the scenes contain not only a lot of humor, but a lot of heart. Each character's story arc guarantees at least a chuckle or two. Even Georgio, who never utters a word, conveys a lot of emotion each time she looks over her shoulder to the person in the back seat of her limo."", 'Love, drugs, revenge, anarchy and more all come together to form one of the most delightfully absurd games in recent memory.', ""As you pick up passengers and take them where they need to go, you must carefully weave your way through obstacles like cars, street lamps, fences and, of course, roundabouts. Most objects in the environment are indestructible, and colliding with them causes damage to your limo. It's important to learn how to slide yourself into gaps as you spin, which allows you to navigate turns and avoid other drivers, who would be easily missable if you were driving like a normal person instead of a spinning maniac. Getting the hang of moving with the limo's rotation requires you to twist your brain a bit, but deftly sliding through obstacles is eminently satisfying. You often have to be quick, though, or you'll spin right into a tree (or worse). Hit enough obstacles, and your limo blows up in spectacular fashion, but don't worry: you won't lose too much in terms of progress."", 'You can get some help moving through town by equipping different power-ups, including one that allows you to slow down time while you move through obstacles, and another that helps you pinpoint hidden collectibles. Eventually, the story also grants you the ability to jump, which opens up even more paths and shortcuts.', ""It's impossible to fail a mission in Roundabout, but you can complete it poorly. You might fail to meet optional challenges, such as completing a mission without hitting anything, or finishing within a certain time limit, and your time is added to a global leaderboard on which you are told how you rank against your friends. If you're more concerned with earning money, you'll want to keep your combo multiplier going by collecting objects quickly and not hitting obstacles along the way. Need to keep up a combo but see no nearby pickups? Just run over some pedestrians. Surely there's no harm in that at all."", ""One of Roundabout's few flaws is the lack of a quick restart option while in the middle of a task. You can retry a mission upon completing it, but if you get halfway through and want to restart for any reason you must ditch your passenger via the pause menu. This stops the mission, but it doesn't take you back to the beginning, forcing you to make that trek yourself. Similarly, there is no easy way to see your score or completion percentage on missions you are not currently engaged with, and there's no way to quickly travel to them either. This isn't much of an issue when playing through the story for the first time, but it makes going back for 100-percent completion more painful than it needs to be."", 'Roundabout is short, but sweet. If you just blaze through the story you can be done in a couple hours or less. Those hours are kept fresh with a handful of challenges that break up the pure driving (such as a destruction derby event and a mission to bounce a soccer ball on your limo repeatedly), which can be replayed for higher leaderboard scores. You\'re also encouraged to dive back into the world of Roundabout to find all its collectibles, finish each mission\'s goals, or play through the entire game in an ""eSports"" speedrun mode that eliminates the FMV stuff.', ""But even without the incentives to keep playing after the credits roll, Roundabout works well as a short chunk of oddbeat humor and arcade-like gameplay. It's unapologetic in its goofiness, and it tells a fun story on top of its relatively unique gameplay.

I see."", 'Thanks goodness, then, for the improvements introduced in Disney Infinity: Marvel Super Heroes 2.0 Edition. The Toy Box is mind-boggingly complex and option-stuffed as never before, but it\'s also now much easier to create your own worlds and adventures, with the game featuring assist options that range from ""give me a hand on this"" all the way to ""build the whole thing for me."" The game as a whole still has its share of problems--the main adventure that comes with it is pedestrian, and there are some technical issues that result in sometimes poor frame rates and broken quests--but Infinity\'s best part has been made even better.', ""My partner again for Disney Infinity 2.0 was my son (now five), and as a lifelong Marvel devotee (thanks in no small part to my constant pushing of the House of Ideas), he was excited to play as some of his favorite characters. The starter pack for Disney Infinity 2.0 contains three Avengers (Iron Man, Thor, and Black Widow), one play set adventure, and two toy box games (which are like genre-specific little mini-games built using Toy Box tools). So that's two less play sets than last year's similarly priced starter pack, and while you can view that as the game providing you less content for the same price, I prefer to see things differently."", ""Like Skylanders (and that other upcoming toys-to-life product from Nintendo, amiibo), Infinity has real world, physical toys that are used to activate their digital versions within a game. One of the problems with last year's Infinity starter pack was that characters were locked to their specific different Disney play set worlds, so if you wanted to play with your kids or friends, you were forced to spend extra money on buying compatible characters. While there's only the one play set in the 2.0 Marvel Super Heroes starter pack, all of the characters that come bundled in can be used, so it's nice to be able to immediately play alongside someone without having to shell out that extra cash. You can, of course, buy other characters separately, so if you do want the whole Avengers crew, be prepared to fork out more money."", ""This new play set is a middling affair, an open-world action game lasting about five or so hours as the Avengers try to stop Loki and the Frost Giants from taking over New York. These themed adventures have always been the weakest parts of Infinity, and this set is no different. You'll find yourself repeating the same types of missions over and over (protect this precious whatsit for two minutes! save these frozen civilians and bring them to the safe zone!), and the open world of New York is pretty lifeless. The streets are filled cars that look exactly the same, the inhabitants don't seem to react to any of the superpowered hijinks happening around them, and there's scant little to do once you finish the main quest arc. The framerate, too, can chug at times, and it's particularly noticeable during co-op."", 'It takes time and actual, honest-to-goodness skill to make anything remotely playable, which makes the new additions to Toy Box in 2.0 extremely welcome ones.', ""But these are grown-up concerns for an adventure that's clearly aimed at pleasing the young. While Skylanders is aimed more at pre-teens and above, Infinity's Avengers seems to skew a little younger, with its simple goals and basic structure probably best suited for those under 10. My five-year-old certainly loved his time with the Avengers, and sharing that adventure with him as we battled countless Frost Giants was an outstanding experience. It was just the right mix for both of us to enjoy--not too hard or puzzling for him to get around, but just tough enough to require me to take the lead in most missions. It helps that the characters themselves--both their physical and digital iterations--are expressive and full of personality. The real world toys are nicely detailed and are quite sturdy (they survived being smashed against each other and being sat on multiple times by a baby in my household), while their in-game counterparts are impressive to play with. Flying around at top speed as Iron Man is a blast, and watching Thor's lightning infused combat strikes never gets old. Poor Black Widow, though; as the only non-superpowered hero in the starter pack, she feels the least fun to play with initially, as the game world just doesn't seem as well suited for characters that can't fly. While Thor and Iron Man can zoom to almost anywhere, unlucky Natasha has to take elevators to reach the tops of buildings. Not exactly the most thrilling entrance for an Avenger."", ""Each character also gets their own specific upgrade tree, and you can use skill points earned as you level up to customise your character. There's a level cap of 20, and you won't be able to buy all the upgrades, which gives 2.0 a welcome yet light customisation feel. Old Infinity characters--and you can use any of them from the previous game--also get this newly added upgrade tree, meaning you'll probably want to dust off that old Jack Sparrow and use him again (and no, old play sets are not compatible with this new game)."", ""Even if you don't have a small child of your own (or can rent) that you can guide through the Avengers playset, it's still worthwhile playing if only for the gear and currency you'll get to use in Infinity's standout mode, Toy Box. This is where imaginations get their chance to shine, and the Toy Box is again a wonderfully open-ended experience where you can build a dizzying array of stuff. Want to try your hand at building a race track through Agrabah? Or create a platforming challenge around a series of high-rises? Or even create more complex games like a top-down action-rpg or a collectibles chase? All of this and more is possible."", 'Possible, of course, is the operative word here. It takes time and actual, honest-to-goodness skill to make anything remotely playable, which makes the new additions to Toy Box in 2.0 extremely welcome ones. Some of the new tools available to you include templates that come with everything you need to create specific game types (just hook the individual pieces up and go), non-playable characters that you can drop into empty worlds that will slowly build an entire themed region for you, and even specific pieces that you can stretch and pull to make whatever size environment you desire. In minutes, for example, I was able to create a large, twisting race track that dovetailed around skyscrapers, using only two pieces from the Toy Box.', ""Sure, going on autopilot may seem like the antithesis to the creative possibilities Toy Box opens up. But for me, this helping hand pushed me to try and create more. Gone is that initial befuddlement after looking at the hundreds of options in the Toy Box and not knowing where to start. Gone is the hesitation of devoting hours of time to creating something that may, in the end, suck a lot. Infinity now shows me what's possible, helps me get started, and removes some of the more time intensive parts of creation. And when I see what others are doing--including the the Toy Box games bundled in with the 2.0 starter pack (a decent tower defense-like game set in Asgard and a less successful Diablo-like action-RPG set in the Klyn space prison) and shared community favorites--it makes me wonder exactly what I can achieve, and I'm excited by the possibilities."", ""It's a pity, then, that the Toy Box doesn't escape some of 2.0's technical foibles. Toy Box worlds would sometimes crash during my time with them, and there was one particular mission in Toy Box's tutorial world that seemed perpetually broken. Having to unlock toys and tools, too, is a chore, but it's a manageable one. Playing through the Avengers playset should earn you enough currency to unlock plenty of toys, but you'll need to keep earning those blue sparkles if you hope to have a full range of creative options eventually available to you."", ""My son, though, cared not for such trivialities. He was happy to run around the various toy box worlds, exploring what each new one had to offer, occasionally offering me direction as I Molecule Man-ed my way around. And when he got bored of me trying to create the perfect game experience, he'd sit and play with the physical figurines, lost in his own imagination. Disney Infinity 2.0 is an amazing game to share with a child, and it could be an inspiring one, too.""]"Miguel Concepcion,17-Sep-14,Hyrule Warriors Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hyrule-warriors-review/1900-6415875/,8,Wii U,"['If youre looking to form an argument that Hyrule Warriors is just fan service as a negative criticism, youre wasting your breath. However novel this Dynasty Warriors-meets-Legend of Zelda game is conceptually, once you open that first chest and Link thrusts that treasure toward the camera, you realize that this is a Legend of Zelda spin-off worth taking seriously. Sometimes its these left-field concepts that make the most sense. Theres a reason why Link was the most well-received character out of the three console-exclusive fighters in Soul Calibur II. And if you know your Legend of Zelda history, seeing the title character herself hold her own in a crowd-based beat-em-up isnt at all unusual. Hyrule Warriors isnt just fan service: its pure fan service.', 'If linear first-person shooters are fundamentally digital remakes of Whac-a-Mole, then the Warriors games and its spin-offs are the slow-burn iterations. The majority of the games are exercises in tactical map management that also let you become the main contributor to the action at ground level, slicing through crowds of simple foes with an ease that is simultaneously empowering and pedestrian. As you liberate one fortification, another keep is being invaded. The key to winning a typical Dynasty Warriors mission often comes down to simply being faster than your enemy in covering the map with your blue color-coded forces.', 'Like the One Piece: Pirate Warriors crossover series, however, Hyrule Warriors is more focused on objectives than it is on removing the red-coded opposition forces from the map. This keeps in line with the goal-oriented design of most Legend of Zelda games, and thus, makes the game all the more welcoming for Zelda fans new to Warriors. If you wish, you can make the game feel more like a traditional Warriors game by taking over each fort one at a time. Such an approach creates its own challenges, since many of the objectives in Hyrule Warriors have timed deadlines. Like any Dynasty Warriors game, Hyrule Warriors is at its most stimulating when it tests your management of priorities. As a Zelda fan, of course you want to save the Deku tree when its being invaded on all sides! But youre also close to liberating a keep at one of the far corners of the map! And since youve just reached 1000 kills, a collectable skulltula has temporarily appeared on the map! Choices!', ""If you're new to Warriors games, setting priorities isnt as easy as it might initially appear. The biggest rush comes when youve completed all the mid-mission objectives and youre left racing against the enemy toward the current victory condition. Even if you confront the boss with a full bar of health, the same cant be said about the health of your home base at the other end of the map. Should you return to your base, or stay and try to defeat the boss to end the mission, thereby saving the base in the process? Choosing wisely in such tight and time-sensitive situations makes victory all the more satisfying."", 'For all the Legend of Zelda-related items, jingles, and familiar faces that are thrown at you every other second, Hyrule Warriors still manages to be a fine Dynasty Warriors spin-off in its own right. If you have muscle memory devoted to the series, then you know that the first priority when beginning a mission is to leap into the fray, get to work in liberating the nearest fort, and set yourself on a path to at least 1000 kills. Hyrule Warriors is not a shallow reskin, but to Warriors faithful, it does look like a new pair of shoes that has been aptly broken in.', 'As a Warriors game in 2014, Hyrule Warriors reaps the benefits of the many criticisms leveled at prior games, with the boss lock-on option that was introduced a few years ago standing out as the most vital lesson. Can you remember Dynasty Warriors dark ages when all you could do was manually point the camera at a boss? The game-changing boss lock-on not only allows you to wade through the crowds of foot soldiers clogging the path, but also helps maintain your forward momentum as you rack up a body count. The meaty sound of slicing through a dozen foes in a single sword stroke never gets old. Its a multilayered cycle of bloodless, PG-13-level mass killings: on one layer, youre constantly motivated to reach 100-kill milestones, while on another layer, youre always on the lookout for the nearest spot of enemy movement on the map, especially when youre killing time before the next objective appears. Even after the mission ticker is updated with your next goal, theres the strong likelihood that youll record another 500 or so bodies in your diary of death as you work on that active objective. The drawback is that its hard to care when youre left with only one or two pitiful enemies; killing them feels like a waste of time and a waste of a blade swing.', 'However novel this Dynasty Warriors-meets-Legend of Zelda game is conceptually, once you open that first chest and Link thrusts that treasure toward the camera, you realize that this is a Legend of Zelda spin-off worth taking seriously.', 'The greatest trick Hyrule Warriors pulls off is in making a convincing argument that the game might just belong in the much-debated Legend of Zelda timeline. When you prescribe to an official timeline that accepts the notion of multiple Links, its not that unreasonable to argue Hyrule Warriors as canon. Although series producer Eiji Aonuma has gone on record stating the contrary, that wont stop fans from disputing this games place in Zelda lore. The impressive cutscenes alone have enough expository weight to make Hyrule Warriors timeline-worthy. Further validating the argument is how the story mode features inter-dimensional journeys to various Legend of Zelda worlds, including lands from Skyward Sword, locales from Twilight Princess, and even the dubiously memorable Water Temple. As an argument for and against the notion of canon-eligibility, Hyrule Warriors even manages to rehash plot key points from the franchise (eg. Sheiks backstory) that are also significant spoilers to the very, very few who will play this game but have never beaten a Legend of Zelda adventure.', 'Some of the best moments in Warriors games are those in which agile combos lead to brief, character-specific cutscenes, so Im not surprised that the studios involved in developing Hyrule Warriors devoted time to giving everyone in the playable roster unique attacks and animations. Watching Link perform spectacular melee attacks only makes one wish such potent moves were available in mainline Legend of Zelda games. Its never jarring to watch him and his supporting cast let loose against the games countless hordes, especially when a single special attack breaks the 50-kill mark.', 'Its a multilayered cycle of bloodless, PG-13-level mass killings.', 'Its not hard to spot the Dynasty Warriors DNA in Hyrule Warriors. You can see Omega Forces signature familiarity with Wushu martial arts in some of Impas attacks. Newcomer Lana, with her adorned sleeves, exposed midriff, and giant ponytail would not look out of place in a Dynasty Warriors game. And if youre wondering where you can find the contributions of co-developer Team Ninja, you need only look for the brutal and often juggle-intensive combos, moves that look like they were ripped right out of Ryu Hayabusas playbook. Executing the most eye-catching moves takes a little time to memorize, but Hyrule Warriors is also very forgiving should you just prefer to mash buttons and watch the hordes dissipate.', 'The flow of time is bittersweet. You wake up one day and you realize that there are more Dynasty Warriors spin-offs and crossovers than there are mainline Dynasty Warriors games. Aside from introducing many Legend of Zelda fans to the Warriors franchise, Hyrule Warriors adds little innovation to Koeis megaseries as a whole, but nevertheless brings an undeniable spark ignited by the crossover cast itself. As one of the more well-produced Warriors games in recent memory, it is easy to see Hyrule Warriors paving the way for more Warriors spin-offs--other properties that have a substantial amount of melee combat. Street Fighter? Dragon Ball? The idea of a Gundam Warriors game, let alone a series, was once an absurd concept, just as Hyrule Warriors was when it was first announced. If the Warriors franchise has proven anything, its that most every entertainment property is fair game. And that prospect is both exciting and a bit scary.']"Kevin VanOrd,16-Sep-14,Lichdom: Battlemage Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/lichdom-battlemage-review/1900-6415873/,6,PC,"['The song you hear calling from the center of Lichdom: Battlemage is one of ice and fire. A chorus chants from within, urging you to chill your personal demons with the ray of frost you blast from your fingertips, and to burn them with showers of brimstone. Elemental powers arent the only ones you command in this magic-driven action game, but they are the two that define the initial hours of Lichdoms overlong campaign, which hobbles to a close long after it milks the joy out of its excellent but single-minded combat.', 'Lets return, however, to those initial hours. Lichdom: Battlemage is built around the most satisfying spellcasting this side of Kingdoms of Amalur, and its this one system that drives the adventure from beginning to end. There is no mana bar obstructing your access to deadly magic. The only cooldowns you need consider are the intrinsic casting times of the spells themselves, not additional timers that dole out casting permission at specified intervals. Wizards and skeletons spawn into the level from nowhere, and you fling icicles at them or soften them up with a hive of buzzing parasites that floats above your head.', 'Casting these spells from Lichdoms first-perspective feels oh so good, and they come in three types of magical flavors, called sigils. Each sigil allows for three casting techniques: a focused attack, an area-of-effect attack, and a parry--termed a nova--that typically offers its own kind of offensive enhancement. A focused spell might take the form of a continuous ray of elemental energy or a ball of filth, though I was most taken by homing missiles, which I could fire off in quick succession or charge up for a more thorough display of destruction. To turn an archer into a pile of ash is simple enough with such a missile: hold a mouse button, then release that flaming projectile and watch your target skeleton dissolve into the wind when it hits.', 'Forgive my focus on fire and ice. Its easiest to describe these types of magic in light of the more complex sigils, such as kinesis and delirium, which allow you to control the battlefield in various ways, turning enemies against each other or halting them in their tracks. I grew fond of a slaughterous trio comprised of necromancy, corruption, and ice. Necromancy does what it says on the tin, turning fiends into friends when the grim reaper comes to visit, while corruption allows you to spread an epidemic of tumorous growths and ravenous parasites. These sigils often work in tandem with each other, turning a sequence of properly-timed blitzes into a colorful spectacle of frozen sorcerers shattering into a trillion pieces. This may be magic, but I am more than a mere magician: I am a demigod.', 'More specifically, I am a Dragon, capital-D, and a significant figure in Lichdoms baffling story, which stars you--a battlemage of the gender you choose--and a scout of complementary gender whose role would best be described as ""exposition faucet."" He or she flits in and out of your travels to share the details of a story thats never properly established, making every line of Lichdoms dialogue a mess of white noise. ""Heres a story about something cool youll never witness for yourself,"" says the scout, in essence, and you move on to making your own story. The beautiful environments thankfully have stories of their own to share; twisted tree trunks and tarnished temples rise from a fetid swamp, and you see massive sea vessels encased in ice, as if they were frozen in time before their captains were aware of such an unlikely danger. CryEngine 3, the same graphics technology that humbled many a PC in 2013 in Crysis 3, has returned to remind you that your machine really needs a new graphics card. To be fair, however, the game looks great even with medium-ranged setting activated, though the games liberal use of motion blur will have you rushing to tweak its visual options to diminish the discomfort.', 'As tempting as it is to compare Lichdom: Battlemage to Skyrim, what with the early snowy environments and all that magic, this is no role-playing game--at least, not in the traditional sense. Lichdom does, however, grant you plenty of agency over how you exercise your magical talents. Your spells are not assigned to you as if they are medicines prescribed by a doctor (burn two brutes to a crisp with this bog-standard fireball and call me in the morning). Instead, you drive your own destiny by designing your spells using the various materials that occasionally rush to your body after a kill as if drawn to your magnetic personality.', 'Elemental powers arent the only ones you command in this magic-driven action game, but they are the two that define the initial hours of Lichdoms overlong campaign, which hobbles to a close long after it milks the joy out of its excellent but single-minded combat.', 'I couldnt possibly begin to detail Lichdoms convoluted spell creation, which isnt ungraspable, but requires that you make sense of various terms--mastery, control, critical effect multiplier, apocalyptical chance--and interpret the results of each step of the crafting process. At first, its difficult to tell why spells behave as they do, especially when there are countless statistical minutiae differentiating one spell from the next. (""These two spells are the same except one offers a slightly larger attack radius and the other does slightly more damage. Is it worth spending time on a decision that wont likely matter much on the field of battle?"") Its both empowering and somewhat tedious to have so much control over so many magical attributes, but whether or not you fall in love with this system, youll spend plenty of time attending to it: more powerful demons shall arrive, and you will have to create higher-level spells to destroy them.', 'After several hours of winding your way through Lichdoms linear levels, it becomes clear that developer Xaviant relied on this combat system to the detriment of other basic aspects of game design. One by one, combat scenarios appear, each one exactly like the last. Enemies spawn into being out of nowhere--and should you die and have to relive the battle, they always materialize in the same locations with no concern for your position relative to their spawn points. You wave your hands about, spreading disease and death, until every demon has fallen--or until you are wholly annihilated. You then interact with a floating sphere that generates a purple hologram depicting two or three characters talking about apparently vital story events you never get to witness for yourself. And then you repeat this scenario, with only boss fights and the occasional appearance of your opposite-gendered exposition vessel to disrupt the flow. Necromancy, ice bolt, ice bolt, fiery aura--once more, with feeling.', 'To be fair, the flow is also disrupted by frequent deaths, an annoyance thats sure to hound you when you enter new areas with spells that no longer adequately protect you, but without the components that would allow you to create stronger magic. Some battles are teeth-gnashingly, hair-pullingly grueling, particularly those with enemies that enjoy freezing you in place, and Lichdom almost takes a perverse delight in how far apart its checkpoints occur. And so you take part in a tedious video game version of Groundhog Day in which you perform the same amazing supernatural feats so often, and in the same repetitive scenarios, that those feats become as boring as collecting Gandalf the Greys dry cleaning.', ""That isnt to say that I dont appreciate the inherent diversity of Lichdoms spellcrafting; a ray of focused flame behaves differently than the necromantic conversion of dead demons, after all. But the game's general approach takes the burden off the design and transfers the impetus of creating variety to me--and without innate structural variety, Lichdom stretches its one excellent idea to the point of tearing. The games inordinate length only reinforces the monotony. I hesitate to suggest a game should be shorter than it already is, but Lichdom itself makes an excellent argument for brevity. Xaviant miscalculated the formula. (Great spellcasting) - (mana bar) + (meaningless story) + (unvaried battles) is not, in fact, equal to 15 or 16 hours of consistent enjoyment and $39.99 of your money."", ""While Lichdom makes a strong case for a shorter game, it also makes the case for another Lichdom game. If there is any game this year deserving of a sequel, its this one. With a steely backbone of meaningful world-building, sensible storytelling, and proper pacing, a Lichdom 2 could have an unassailable place to hang its best asset. The game at hand is concerned only with the magic. A few hours in, I was convinced that it might be enough. The love affair didn't last, but Ill always have those golden memories.""]"Cameron Woolsey,16-Sep-14,Minimum Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/minimum-review/1900-6415872/,6,PC,"['As the shooter genre aged, it began to reach toward other genres for inspiration. Bending shooting with the statistics and upgrades of a role playing game became a popular option, but what would happen if a third-person shooter was merged with a multiplayer online battle arena, or MOBA, spiced up with a dash of striking minimalistic graphics? The result would be Minimum, a multiplayer shooter that takes cues from the MOBA playbook without copying the design outright. Minimum features impressive maps, charming and clean aesthetics, and superb, high-octane gameplay that manages to keep your pulse pounding after many hours. However, a host of glitches constantly pester, threatening to replace any moment of joy with sheer frustration.', ""Minimum's central feature, and where you spend the majority of your time, is its fantastic Titan mode. Here, two teams of five players do battle while aiding and protecting their titan, an enormous mechanical colossus. In Titan mode, your team's goal is to guide your metal friend all the way to the enemy's lair to destroy their power core, all the while tearing through two defensive walls, the opposing players, and, of course, the enemy titan itself."", 'Battles have a satisfying ebb and flow as players either fight a titan-charged onslaught or work together to gather precious materials. Eventually, the titans meet and clash in the center of the arena, and both teams simultaneously fight off the opposing side while helping their titan by chipping away the health of its equally massive adversary. As one titan is defeated, the other continues its steady march toward the enemy stronghold until victory--or defeat at the hands of the opposing team.', 'When both titans meet their doom, the game enters a temporary creep phase that continues until the titans respawn. In this phase, you hunt small, neutral AI-controlled creatures, which drop power-ups that charge the fallen titan. The more power-ups gathered, the stronger your titan becomes when revived, and its chances of winning the next titan clash are greatly improved--so long as your team works together to prevent your enemies from attacking your empowered titan and protecting their weaker allies.', 'Battles have a satisfying ebb and flow as players either fight a titan-charged onslaught or work together to gather precious materials.', ""The constantly changing battlefield, along with smart level design, makes every battle in Titan mode a thrilling joyride. Snipers take aim and fire bright, colorful shots between the shuffling metal legs of titans. Grenades pop, sending blocky bodies flying, and warriors brandishing swords wreathed in red or green flame slam head-on in a whirlwind of multihued fire. These chaotic fights erupt in all corners of Minimum's imaginative maps. Each extensive level features elevators, sniper perches and, if you know how to be sneaky, plenty of pathways that either lead you to a fight where you're needed or allow you to sneak up behind unsuspecting foes. If you find yourself in the thick of a battle that is turning against you, there is always cover nearby. I found myself falling in love with every map I played. My favorite, however, goes to Path of Lanterns, a horseshoe-shaped level adorned by ancient Japanese castles."", ""Weapons and armor grant powerful abilities that aid you in battle. Your character isn't exactly a powerful hero to be chosen among many as in typical MOBAs. After all, as per Minimum's fundamental art direction, everyone starts as a character made of white or red rectangles in humanoid form. Abilities, instead, come from your equipment, where personalized loadouts allow you to create your own ultimate warrior. You can become a walking tank, sacrificing movement speed for more health and increased weapon damage, or perhaps a crafty ninja, dual-wielding katanas while receiving speed boosts for every foe you cut down."", 'The constantly changing battlefield, along with smart level design, makes every battle in Titan mode a thrilling joyride.', ""Picking up building materials in-game allows you to upgrade your armor up to three levels on the fly, increasing the effectiveness of the abilities. Gathering glowing blue blocks dropped by defeated enemies empower weapons by up to five levels, undergoing an impressive visual metamorphosis. But keep in mind, a death resets your weapon's level back to zero; however, your armor level stays the same. At the end of a match you are awarded in crafting materials, split into blocks and polyhedrons, which you spend in the armory to craft even more powerful weapons and armor."", 'Minimum offers a few, more familiar, multiplayer modes in Team Deathmatch and Horde. They share a list of smaller, arena-style maps, ranging from an ancient Japanese garden lit with paper lanterns to a gleaming space station, complete with a docking spaceship and antigravity areas. Team Deathmatch pits you in a five-on-five match where the first team to hit 50 kills wins. Removing titans from the equation does lessen the excitement somewhat, but the gunplay is competent enough for team deathmatch to be fun in bursts. Building material for armor is also more of a trickle than the shower seen in titan mode, which adds a flare of challenge, keeping you not only on the offense, but also on the lookout for rare crafting material while dodging plasma missiles and avoiding turrets.', 'The dull Horde mode is even less likely to keep your attention. In Horde, you and your team defend against an onslaught of enemies such as astronauts, ninjas, and dinosaurs--yes, dinosaurs. Minimums bots, however, are too dumb to even make fighting blocky raptors all that engaging. Enemies spawn in random locations throughout the map and proceed to take you out either by dancing in place while shooting, or by charging, blades drawn, into your stream of fire. Horde is a yawn-inducing affair, where most of the challenge comes from surviving against bullet sponges while watching out for dinosaurs that nip at you from behind. You get one life per round, but dying in Horde allows you to keep up with the action as a camera floating behind your allies backs. Trying to move to different angles, however, is nauseating. Instead of weaving with the changing environment, the camera smacks into objects while occasionally vibrating in protest to your attempt to get a clearer picture. Warning your buddies of impending dinosaur attacks isnt easy when your view is stuck inside a wall.', ""Minimum is still far from finished, and it shows. Menu screens flicker, and occasionally you load into a match frozen for several seconds as environmental objects pop into view. Horde mode's follow cam is nauseating, as it smacks into objects surrounding the player in focus. Worst of all, however, are the shockingly frequent game crashes. During my first four hours into the game, Minimum crashed once per hour, forcing me to restart my computer. Oddly, the crashes only seemed to occur while I was either trying to quit the game or navigate the menu; the problem never cropped up while I was in a game. Minimum is due to receive updates in the forms of new weapons, armor pieces, and maps, but given its current state, I'd rather see the glitches and game-ending bugs ironed out before getting a new toy or two."", 'Minimum is a game of incredible moments. Watching an enormous titan, its form taking after a sumo wrestler, lifting another titan, designed after a samurai, straight into the night sky and tossing it into a cliff is awe-inspiring. More than a dozen hours in and my heart still flutters at the sight enemy titan marching along to a slow, thumping soundtrack. Titan mode manages to be both recognizable and fresh, while featuring some incredible maps in which to blow your opponents away. Minimum can be something special, but the unfortunate distractions, such as watching your computer boot up for the umpteenth time thanks to another crash, keep it from reaching its goals. With a few tweaks and perhaps some extra building blocks, Minimum can, like the imposing titans that call it home, stand tall among its peers.']"Josiah Renaudin,16-Sep-14,Murasaki Baby Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/murasaki-baby-review/1900-6415871/,7,PlayStation Vita,"[""Murasaki Baby is a nightmare framed by your greatest childhood frights. The scenery is ghoulish, with mangled trees drooping overhead as you guide a defenseless child through dark storms and even darker caverns. The denizens she meets along the way are ripped right out of a Jhonen Vasquez comic, sporting noses for faces and gaping mouths on their foreheads. It's no world I'd care to travel through, but the grotesquely creative environments are still somehow enchanting. The beautiful, hand-sketched landscapes are perfectly paired with a spine-chilling soundtrack that accentuates the child's loneliness. It packs an auditory punch, but how you control the game weakens the experience by distracting you from Murasaki Baby's alluring look."", ""It's unclear who the scared little girl is or why she was abandoned, but you feel responsible for her fate as soon as the game starts. Beyond her affectionate coos and bone-rattling shrieks, the only discernible noises she offers are cries for her mother that she squeezes through her mangled teeth. You can't pick her up and carry her, so instead you place a finger on the touchscreen to grab the frightened child's hand. Dragging her almost-elastic arm too far forward causes her to stumble and eventually fall to the dirt, so you must gently guide her forward as you search for her missing mother."", ""Just about every movement is controlled through the Vita's front and back screens. Along with the hand-holding, you use another finger to control the position of a heart-shaped balloon to which the child is clinging. This magenta memento, which matches the bow decorating the child's wiry hair, can be popped with a single prick. It's her life force, so you have to pay close attention to its position when flying safety pins or wooly one-eyed spiders fight to puncture it."", ""All other actions are controlled through quick swipes on the rear touchpad. Popping other characters' balloons gives you the ability to change your environment with the flick of a finger, painting the backdrops with vivid reds, greens, or blues. Shifting the palette might give you the power to summon thunderstorms, channel electricity, turn your balloon into stone, or even shrink the child down in order to overcome more advanced sequences. Tapping the back of your Vita when the shading is orange creates gusts of wind that push a dilapidated sailboat across a gully, while jabbing a giant in the yellow background spurs him to shake the earth and demolish specific obstacles in your way."", ""The beautiful, hand-sketched landscapes are perfectly paired with a spine-chilling soundtrack that accentuates the child's loneliness."", ""There is a medley of abilities you need to play with in order to solve each puzzle, most of which call for expert timing. Although you won't likely feel challenged by the basic riddles, it's fun to mix and match puzzle-solving techniques on the fly to see what works, and it can be rewarding to master the often-precise timing. Additionally, the visual flourishes stemming from these abilities--like watching your balloon crystallize as you freeze the environment around you--make this already striking package even more potent."", ""The presentation can be intoxicating, and that's why the control scheme is so frustrating. Having your finger on the screen during the majority of the game means that there are parts of the display you simply can't see. You can position your hand so that it doesn't command too much real estate, but once you're asked to worry about the safety of both the child and her balloon, your vision becomes far too obstructed. The experience can quickly become a disjointed game of digital Twister, forcing you to position both your hands and the Vita in an obtrusive manner."", ""Murasaki Baby's biggest sin is that it's just not all that fun to control, and having your fingers cover corners of the screen is detrimental to both how you play and see the game. I found myself less focused on the dynamic presentation and more concerned with making sure the different pieces on screen were in the right place at the right time. The Vita's multitouch display responds elegantly to every touch, so every time the balloon popped, it actually felt like it was my fault and not a result of broken mechanics. And for the most part, holding the character's hand throughout the many terrifying sights and sounds makes you feel more connected with her every move. It's just a shame that it comes at the expense of fully enjoying everything this gothic world has to offer."", ""The mechanical failings are clearest when you're allowed to let go of the child's hand and briefly use the analog sticks to get from place to place. A particular level has you control a stroller of sorts that takes away any need to poke or prod either of the two touch screens. Here, I took in every piece of geometry. I appreciated the heavy character shading, the luminous hues of the scenery, the forbidding setting, and the ghostly audio mix. Murasaki Baby is a brilliant-looking game, but the moments of unobstructed vision are too few and far between."", ""Controlling Murasaki Baby can be tiresome, and your hands are too often covering the dazzling, shadowy vistas that provide such a distinctive personality. Still, this often-touching adventure is too great an audio-visual treat to discount. You learn to care for the lost little girl whose arching tears graze the edges of her misplaced mouth, and the multitude of imaginative abilities that make use of the Vita's inputs are interesting enough to keep your attention. Despite my distaste for all the hand-holding, Murasaki Baby's mesmerizing art style and strong emotional backbone left me too invested to let go.""]"Heidi Kemps,15-Sep-14,Hatoful Boyfriend Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hatoful-boyfriend-review/1900-6415870/,7,PC,"['If you asked me to summarize Hatoful Boyfriend in a sentence, it would include several endearingly-applied, exasperated expletives and a forceful proclamation of its pervasive, undeniable weirdness. How you sum up something that seemingly defies any logical description?', 'Theres a genre of text-heavy adventure games originating from Japan that involve attempting to earn the love of digital characters. These games tend to get lumped together under the Western term ""dating sims."" There is a subset of these called ""otome games."" Targeted towards women players, they feature female protagonists surrounded by attractive men, and over the course of the game, the protagonist can potentially earn the love of one of many available suitors. Not many of these titles have been released in English; the Hakuoki series is probably the most visible example, though several others have recently appeared on smartphone app stores and on PC digital download services like Steam.', 'What does this have to do with anything? Well, at its core, Hatoful Boyfriend is an otome game. Its got the classic shoujo-manga male character archetypes that pervade such games (as well as much of Japanese women-oriented popular media): the earnest and hardworking boy next door, the caring teacher, the secretive psychopath, the snooty pampered rich boy, the track star, the ladies man, and the quiet, spiritually tortured introvert. Theyre all students at the same high school, that most archetypical of Japanese story settings, and its up to you, playing as heroine Hitori (or any name you so please), to find the boy of your dreams.', 'This isnt a typical Japanese high school, mind you: this is St. PigeoNations, an elite academy for the nations best and brightest birds. Youre the first--and only--human to enroll in this school for intelligent, talking birds. All those available men I mentioned above? Birds. All of them. Photorealistic birds that only ever appear as static visualizations over the course of the game.', 'It gets weirder. In the Hatoful Boyfriend universe, birds have become Nobel Prize winners, famous bloggers, and government officials. Your birdie boyfriends-to-be may constantly fall asleep, obsess over pudding, and believe that they are dark heroes fighting for the fate of the universe. Hitori herself apparently lives in a literal cave, which is simply accepted as normal.', 'In fact, very little seems to faze Hitori--she just goes about her school life, interacting with the various fowl personalities with nary a second thought. Gameplay is simplistic even for the genre, consisting entirely of reading text and selecting choices that tell Hitori what to say and where to go. Additional options are unlocked on subsequent playthroughs, allowing you to explore alternative pathways to avian romance. There are quite a few endings to uncover, and if you want every in-game achievement, youll have to explore all possible routes to true love. Some of these can be rather annoying to earn, especially when individual characters are attached to more than one ending variant; youll see a lot of the same dialogue many times over, though a built-in text skip helps ease the monotony somewhat.', ""But theres a genuine--though somewhat inexplicable--charm to Hatoful Boyfriend that works in its favor, even with the simplistic mechanics and occasional text annoyances. Before you know it, you're caught up in the weird, weird world of making dove-eyes to actual doves. Eventually, thanks to the fast-forward option and copious save slots, youll have seen the routes for several birds and have had a few puzzling encounters--events that seem strange even in this bizarre reality."", 'And then, after several of these fairly breezy playthroughs, Hatoful Boyfriends narrative completely pulls the rug out from under you, transforming into an altogether different beast. By this point, what seemed like a weird and ridiculous concept is now completely acceptable and believable to you, so when the game goes off the rails in such an unexpected direction, you are absolutely blindsided... until you think about whats happened, what youve seen up to that point, and realize that this revelation was there in front of you the whole time.', 'Its this sudden, perception-shattering twist that remakes Hatoful Boyfriend from a bizarre parody into a memorable visual adventure. The way it works on you is subtle and ingenious: by the time the story moves forward, you have a genuine emotional investment in its characters, all of whom are just photographs of birds superimposed upon drawn backgrounds. Hatoful Boyfriend is a showcase of how clever writing and engaging characters can make even the strangest of concepts feel absolutely real.', 'Hatoful Boyfriend is a unique experience, one that goes well beyond its bonkers concept and intentionally strange visual presentation. I was expecting to simply giggle at a nonsensical game in which I tried to woo feathered men, and what I received instead was wholly and wonderfully unexpected. Anyone with a taste for the unusual would do well to enjoy the company of these fetching fowl.']"Kevin VanOrd,12-Sep-14,Destiny Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/destiny-review/1900-6415863/,6,PS4 & Xbox One,"[""It's called the Black Garden. You see it from a clifftop above, gazing across the blooming acres through a thick green haze, and imagine the sights that might be seen there, and the adventures you might have there. The reality of the garden is sadly never better than the stories you might make up in your head when you look down at it. What you see is a facade; the garden is a broken promise of adventures you never have and landscapes never explored, and it represents the whole of Destiny, a multiplayer shooter that cobbles together elements of massively multiplayer games but overlooks the lessons developers of such games learned many years ago. I dream of the tales that might one day be told in that sprawling expanse, but Destiny is not yet telling them."", 'Instead, Destiny prefers telling the same pedestrian stories time and time again, hoping to transfix you with its rinse-and-repeat pace and ply you with the possibility of better loot, rather than with gameplay diversity that gives you good reason to hope for surprises on the horizon. Cooperative missions--some of them occurring within the story, and others, called strikes, occurring outside of it--are primarily about doors and computers. Your robotic companion, an orb voiced by Game of Thrones actor Peter Dinklage, hacks into a lot of them, and it is your job to shoot aliens hailing from various galactic races while he drones the occasional word of encouragement. (""I\'ll work faster,"" he says, in a bored not-quite-robot, not-quite human delivery that, like most of Destiny, lacks energy and charisma.) The fight may end with an elite enemy, or even a giant boss, that absorbs many minutes worth of bullet fire before it falls, just in time for Dinklage-bot to announce his success and open the door that leads to another firefight and another terminal to hack into.', 'The repetition may not bother you at first. It\'s easy to be taken in by Destiny\'s gorgeous shell, a slick and striking wrapper that surrounds the hollow and unimaginative game languishing inside of it. Everything about the game screams ""big budget,"" and Destiny\'s versions of Earth, Mars, the Moon, and Venus are meant to be ogled and appreciated. Outside of the pockets of alien invaders and the dropships that bring you even more strange entities to annihilate, these are sterile places, more like stunning screensavers than dynamic domains. But what views Destiny offers! From the golden-red sands of Mars rise rocky crags and abandoned facilities that speak to a history the story offers too few glimpses into. On Venus, you might hesitate to step foot into streams of unknown purple liquid that couldn\'t exist on the planet as we currently understand it. These sights are awe-inspiring, though Destiny takes a ""look but don\'t touch"" approach to them. That purple liquid? It\'s fine to walk through. Destiny\'s environments are oblivious to your presence, more cold and indifferent than hostile and mysterious.', ""Make no mistake: Destiny's mechanical basics are, for the most part, superb. Interacting with this online-only shooter is a delight. The confident shooting model, the intuitive menus, the unblemished frame rate--all of these elements make for a fantastic foundation to build a worthy dynamic multiplayer shooter upon. Pulse rifles shoot their rhythmic barrages with great power, and charging up a fusion rifle and releasing its payload is akin to holding your breath and then expelling it in one rewarding sigh. The game's best combat feature, however, might be its melee attack, regardless of which of the game's three all-too-similar classes you choose. Destiny nails that special, difficult-to-define something comprised of fluid controls, excellent collision detection, and awesome technology that makes every action silky and responsive. You can leap and glide through the air, a mechanic that gives Destiny a sense of freedom that matches its open spaces, and helps you escape danger when encounters get tough."", ""The most powerful foes put up a decent fight, using cover to their advantage, protecting themselves with shields, or assailing you en masse. If only you got access to the aliens' intriguing firearms instead of being confined to the game's excellent but bog-standard arsenal. Luckily, you gain access to different types of slow-to-replenish grenades, and a few superpowers, such as the warlock's magical area-of-effect projectile, that take even longer to recharge. The extraterrestrial races you battle come in all shapes and sizes and yank their names from the Dungeons & Dragons rulebook: wizard, minotaur, harpy, and the like. Tearing down the alien hordes can be enjoyable. You set the sights of your machine gun on a chain of thralls and mow them down while a troop of acolytes fires on you from a distance. The stage is set for an electrifying showdown."", 'The disappointment of Destiny is that it fails to capitalize on the possibilities. Story missions and strike missions have you taking to Destiny\'s broad and beautiful settings with a friend or two at your side, but breadth isn\'t the games primary calling card: it\'s repetition. Excellent basics are betrayed by half-baked ideas stretched into hours of slow-paced and redundant tasks that have you asking yourself, ""Hey, isn\'t this the same canyon I just raced through on my handy speeder a few moments ago? Hey, didn\'t I just cross this hill 10 minutes ago, and 20 minutes ago, and an hour ago?"" It\'s tempting to compare Destiny to full-fledged massively multiplayer role-playing games, but doing so reveals how much more diverse typical MMOGs really are. By contrast, Destiny makes no attempt to mask the sameness of its primary tasks. To pursue new content in Destiny is to fondly recall a trophy you\'ve already won. It\'s nice to relive the victory, but new celebrations require new victories, not home movies of the old ones.', 'Destiny tries to mask its repetitiveness with a vague story that uses more cryptoscientific nonsense than an entire season of Star Trek, and grants your character so meaningless an identity, and so little dialogue, that he or she might as well be a silent protagonist. ""Lure out the Vex Gate Lord that protects the Endless Steps and bring its head back to the Awoken,"" says the mission text, making you ponder phenomena you know next to nothing about. What is the role of the Awoken in this solar system? What is the historical relevance of the Endless Steps? What purpose drives the Vex, and indeed, what do the Awoken hope to learn?', ""I don't have the answers."", ""The story hints at its potential about halfway through, when you meet two of Destiny's few non-Dinklage characters, both of whom wear dramatic costumes and fill their speech with pregnant pauses worthy of the best Bond villains. Alas, Destiny wastes the opportunity to develop a mystery worth caring about, and instead reverts to more fetch quests, then follows them up with a manipulative ending that reminds you that the game's superlative orchestral soundtrack does far more work in establishing this world's tone than the mediocre writing ever does. To be fair, some of the item descriptions, and lore-heavy explanations you can read on Destiny's official website, fill in some narrative gaps. But even many of those explanations require you to meet certain thresholds so that you can unlock them. Developer Bungie doesn't take responsibility for its own story; instead, it passes the responsibility for learning the story on to you, but never infuses its game with the richness of tone that might inspire you to seek answers."", ""There's loot, of course, much of it in the form of new weapons, armor, and blueprints called engrams, which you redeem at a hub called the Tower. You share this space with a dozen-plus other players, most of whom talk to the vendors there without concern for other players. If you're used to the barrage of loot you receive while playing games like Borderlands or Diablo III, be sure to prepare for Destiny's slower pace of doling out rewards. It's befitting that meaningful new stuff doesn't come that frequently, given how Destiny on the whole feels like a standard-sized experience stretched entirely too thin. Once you leave the tale behind, which happens about 15 hours into Destiny should you play story missions that match your level, your desire for loot is the biggest determining factor when deciding whether to stick with Destiny or to jump ship."", ""I'm not sure I will return, in spite of the promise of a larger-scale raid event soon to come. Each automatic rifle is more or less like the last, and the various passive upgrades do little to spur my interest. Much of Destiny feels underdone and underthought. There's no scaling system in place to allow players of too-disparate levels to play together, or even to draw you back to lower-level areas. The presence of players outside of your fireteam is more window dressing than vital mechanic, particularly if you level up in ways that don't involve performing patrol missions, which return you to previously explored areas to perform random, boring quests. It is on patrol missions that you stumble upon public events, which draw nearby players together to vanquish greater foes, like a hardy spider tank that soaks up rockets and heavy fire. Given Destiny's habit of delivering small-scale action in a large-scale world, it's a shame it's so easy to miss out on these events: they are one of the few elements that make Destiny spring to life."", 'Destiny prefers telling the same stories time and time again, hoping to transfix you with its rinse-and-repeat pace and ply you with the possibility of better loot, rather than with gameplay diversity that intimates surprises hovering on the horizon.', ""The crucible is where the action heats up, even if it rarely erupts with true thrills. This is where Destiny's competitive multiplayer lurks, and it's entirely competent. A post-Halo Bungie reminds us once again of its mastery of level design, with intricate maps of various sizes that get put to good use in four different modes. Six-member free-for-all deathmatch finds its stride on maps that recall the winding corridors and central combat arenas of Unreal Tournament, and gives you a good reason to wield a shotgun if you've gotten accustomed to equipping a sniper rifle in that secondary weapon slot. This six-player deathmatch also has a team variation, on which teams of three hunt each other at a more thoughtful pace than the other modes provide. It's best to stick with friends for this one: communication is key, as is carefully surveying the area before making moves that could put you directly in an opponent's line of sight. It's Destiny's tensest mode, but one that strangers can easily disrupt. Typical team deathmatches involve twice as many players on maps that sometimes allow you to leap into one of Destiny's two combat vehicles. (Oh, how I wish these vehicles had been put to better use outside of the crucible.)"", ""Control mode, in which players seek to secure specified control points, is the most enjoyable, however, allowing both lone wolves and focused teams to contribute. There are some issues here, such as the way the auto-targeting can cause a passing opponent to grab your targeting reticle when you are trying to fire at a different target. However, competitive play proves itself a worthy way of leveling up and earning access to gear otherwise unavailable. The maps themselves eventually reveal subtle but clever details that become important tactical considerations. Those large space-age doors take a moment to open, and do so loudly enough that you might very well signal your approach. Mounted guns offer a view of the exact right amount of real estate, making a stationary gunner potentially valuable but by no means overpowered. If any attack is overpowered, it might be the arc blade, the bladedancer subclass's super ability, which cuts through you like a knife through space butter. (It's the gunslinger's golden gun ability that I most often succumb to, however.)"", 'You might summarize Destiny by the way in which it wraps up its story. Once the final, hackneyed closing scene finishes, fireteam members are awarded the same weapon, regardless of class, and a handful of currency. This reminder of how wholly unspecial you are is the big finale of a lavishly produced but troubled game that excels in the basics but lacks creativity and heart. It is role-playing grind in shooter form--an empty house built on a firm foundation.']"Peter Brown,11-Sep-14,Theatrhythm Final Fantasy: Curtain Call Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/theatrhythm-final-fantasy-curtain-call-review/1900-6415868/,8,3DS,"[""There aren't many video game series with music as memorable as Final Fantasy, and there's no game with as much of that great music as Theatrhythm Final Fantasy: Curtain Call. As a follow up to 2012's Theatrhythm, Curtain Call trumps its predecessor in every way. That's not to say that the last game was a poor experience, but Curtain Call collects the lot of the original's music, adds a heap of new tracks from the library of classic and contemporary Final Fantasy games, and nestles them between both familiar and new gameplay modes."", ""Of course, anyone who's interested in Final Fantasy and its fantastic soundtracks may have already played the original Theatrhythm, and the fact that the core gameplay hasn't evolved in a drastic fashion for Curtain Call might make it seem like it's not worth the repeat trip down memory lane. Yet, with new soundtracks, multiplayer modes, and the addition of every DLC track from the first game, there are plenty of reasons to jump back into the realm of Theatrhythm."", ""Curtain Call's rhythm-based gameplay is easy to pick-up, fun to play, and is as challenging as you want it to be thanks to a generous range of difficulty levels. The control scheme is also flexible--you can play with just the 3DS stylus, or with buttons and the analog stick. The actions you perform are as simple as tapping a button or the 3DS touchscreen, swiping the stylus or analog stick in a specific direction, or holding down an input for a few seconds. Sometimes these actions are combined. For example: you might hold down a button and move the analog stick to follow a winding path of notes on screen. It's necessary to follow the tutorial to recognize when you're expected to perform certain actions, but after a few songs, tapping and swiping along to the music becomes second nature. Curtain Call is only really challenging when you ramp up the difficulty to the highest level."", ""Depending on the song you choose, you'll play one of three types of stages: battle music stages, field music stages, or event music stages. Battle stages put a team of four characters against a series of monsters in a manner reminiscent of classic Final Fantasy battle scenarios. Each character has their own stream of inputs, and though this sounds like it can get complicated, it doesn't. Despite the fact that you control four characters, their actions never overlap."", ""When you aren't facing behemoths and cactuars during rousing battle stages, you can play through event and field stages for a bit of a respite. The peaceful sight of a character traveling through the wilderness during a field stage is relaxing compared to the frantic pace of most battle stages, and event stages give you the chance to watch classic Final Fantasy cutscenes as you tap and swipe along with the music."", 'Before venturing out into the game, you create a party of four adventurers from a small selections of characters, but there are over 50 that you can unlock as you play through collections of stages known as quest medleys. In medleys and other stages, you earn items, abilities, and experience points that will bolster the strength and capabilities of your team, too. Equipping an item to your team may restore a bit of your ""health"" meter after a series of missed notes and cues, or it might guarantee that your favorite magical being is summoned during combat. You also earn CollectaCards, which give you the chance to apply permanent stat boosts to characters. The rarer the card, the better the chance that its stat boosts will stick. Toying with customization options for your party is a nice distraction between stages, imparting an additional bit of Final Fantasy flare, but it\'s easy to ignore these elements and succeed just the same.', ""Competitive multiplayer makes its debut in Curtain Call, allowing you to challenge opponents both local and online. Essentially, two players do their best to complete the same song, which the computer chooses randomly after you each pick a candidate. Do well during the match and you'll build up a meter that will ultimately allow you to inflict hazards upon your opponent. The winner of the match is the person who ends up with the highest score, and the reward is a CollectaCard of your choosing. It's good to see competitive play make its debut in Curtain Call and it's a handy option to have when you want to measure your skills, but given that you're constantly doing that within the single player game anyway, it's not a game changing feature. It's merely a nice addition to an already solid experience."", ""Curtain Call's engrossing gameplay and its wealth of music make it easy to recommend to anyone with fond memories of Final Fantasy. That said, it's difficult to recommend to anyone without those ties. Everything within is a tip of the hat to the series at large, and without the experience and context to know what you're looking at, it may be one of the most baffling mixes of characters, creatures, and events ever assembled. That doesn't detract from the high-quality music and gameplay within, but for a game grounded in nostalgia, it's hard to deny that it might not excite people who aren't fans of the series. But, for those who are, Curtain Call is a heartfelt walk down memory lane. As someone who played the first Theatrhythm a lot, I'm still enthusiastic for Curtain Call due to the large amount of new content. It's hard to imagine fans of Final Fantasy not leaping at the chance to reconnect with their memories and some of the most beautiful music from the history of Final Fantasy, and playing Curtain Call is the perfect way to do so.""]"Kevin VanOrd,10-Sep-14,The Sims 4 Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-sims-4-review/1900-6415867/,6,PC,"['Control-shift-C-""motherlode."" It\'s a series of commands that every Sims player knows, the one that infuses your bank account with precious simoleans for buying the fanciest lamps, laying the plushest carpet, and landscaping with the most impressive of shrubbery. Few games are so defined by their cheat codes, yet if you want to move a digital family into an upscale abode without devoting dozens of hours to building up funds, this code is your ticket to affordable maid service and plush window treatments.', ""This approach treats The Sims as a dollhouse, a role that The Sims 4 fulfills with some aplomb. If you want to build but prefer not to micromanage the details, the game comes with various prearranged rooms that you can fit together like Tetris pieces, but if you're devoted to the arts of architecture and interior design, you have the series most streamlined set of buying and building tools yet. Buy and Build modes share the same interface, making it simple to mix creation and decoration rather than forcing you to approach each activity as an opposing side of the same simolean. Stretching and dragging walls into properly modular rectangles? It's as easy as knowing how to use a mouse and keyboard. Not sure what category a chess set falls under? Just type a keyword into the search field and select the best match. Given the conflation of two modes into one, and the amount of categories to sift through, The Sims 4 does a creditable job of leading you right to the objects and tools you're seeking."", ""On the surface, there would seem to be more than enough styles and objects from which to choose: sofas of various shapes and colors, tiles for making your bathroom as 1970s-era-tacky as you'd like, and other means of personalizing the homes of your little computer people. When the time comes to set up a life of leisure, however, the boundaries become more rigid than they first appear. The Sims 3's Create-a-Style options, which let you texturize and paint your surfaces and textiles in intricate ways, has been dropped, leaving only predetermined colors in their place. Color can make a great throughline for aesthetically linking various shapes and styles, but should you gun for an eclectic interior, you quickly find that objects don't always have the same hues available between them. Mixing and matching can make a room look more random than refined; the Create-a-Style option provided a means of connecting disparate decor, and its loss diminishes creativity."", ""In fact, The Sims 4 as a rule feels diminished when compared to even the vanilla version of The Sims 3, before it had the benefit of add-ons that let you be a ghostbuster and live in high-rises. Much has already been made of the features that didn't make the cut, but even if you don't have a list of those features on hand when you play, the squashed purview is apparent. I didn't mind the small lot I initially laid claim to until I decided to splurge on a telescope, an item that at one time was compact enough to fit into a small corner of the yard. By contrast, The Sims 4's starting telescope, a gargantuan beast that most amateur astronomers would kill to own, couldn't fit, and I ultimately erected it on a public lot, in front of the library. Previous Sims modders (and a Sims 2 expansion) had introduced microscopes to the mix, but I had no room for the lab-quality colossus in The Sims 4. Limitations, limitations, limitations. It wasn't The Sims I had gotten used to over the last several years."", ""The Sims 4 doesn't just take away. It has presents to give, too, in the form of new kinds of social interactions, objects, and other charming detours that make keeping an eye on your sims a sheer delight. Multitasking is at the forefront of these changes: sims greet visitors without putting down their cereal bowls and chat while gardening. Using the toilet is also not an event your sims have to fully focus on, and I laughed heartily when the digital version of myself sat on the john while playing games on his tablet; it really was like peeking in on a little me. My sim daughter, meanwhile, felt it was appropriate to drink her orange juice while peeing, a combination of activities I am not sure I can support."", ""I am not sure I should share my misgivings with the young woman, though. In The Sims 4, sims are quite moody, getting embarrassed should you send one sim to the shower when another is seated on the toilet, and getting randy when they're in the vicinity of their spouses. You're constantly pushed to take advantage of these moods, earning points for small accomplishments that you spend on rewards that provide temporary buffs (get energized immediately!) or permanent enhancements (never get fired!). Sims also gain access to new kinds of social interactions when they get moody--angry sims want to get in fights, embarrassed sims need reassurance, focused sims want to play chess, and so forth."", ""Changes in mood are accompanied by predictably ridiculous exclamations in the gibberish language known as simlish. One sim I closely maintained was particularly mischievous, fooling neighbors with a hand buzzer and insulting anyone that dared assemble at the club while she sucked down a nightcap. I would have her make fun of other sims' clothing, which she did in an adorable snotty tone, causing her victim to recoil in horror at her obnoxiousness. I gave that same sim the snobby trait, and selected a default walk animation which had her head tilted upwards so that she could look down her nose at the plebeians that dared walk the same Earth. Watching her strut her stuff was consistently wonderful, though she wasn't the only digital person worth keeping an eye on: miniature me would use books as puppets, opening and closing them like mouths and mimicking what they might say before cracking them open and actually reading. Watching your sims in action means having a frequent smile stretched across your face."", ""Turning these individual activities into long-form stories isn't as compelling as it was in The Sims 3, however. The previous game's open world, which allowed for seamless travel and smooth multi-sim control, has been replaced by smaller lots separated by loading screens--a system that harks back to older games in the series. Having to stare at a loading screen when you want to travel to the park is distracting enough; moving back to your home lot to maintain other family members and finding them standing stiffly in front of the house, waiting for your commands rather than naturally going about their business, is even more so."", ""The deeper you wish to go, the more roadblocks you stumble upon. Perhaps it's sensible that a game with no large spaces to traverse would not feature bicycles, but I still miss riding across town, zooming over hills and through valleys until I reached the graveyard and harassed the ghosts there. Not only is transportation gone, but so are the hills and valleys, all of them smoothed out into a uniformly flat surface that doesn't support basements or terraforming. Elsewhere, the emphasis on specific tasks detracts from the freeform noodling. When giving my first birthday party, for instance, I was so focused on fulfilling assigned tasks like serving drinks that I failed to notice how differently The Sims 4 handled birthday cakes than its predecessor. I missed being able to simply buy the cake, scatter around some balloons, and have a wonderful time. When I had failed to please the birthday girl, I didn't feel as though I hadn't given everyone a good enough time--I felt like I hadn't clicked on the right things in the right order. It is in that distinction that you find the difference between The Sims 4 and its predecessor."", ""In short, The Sims 4's biggest problem is that The Sims 3 exists, and describing where it stumbles by necessity means looking at where the series has been. This is a lovely and lively game that elicits constant smirks, but The Sims 4's moments never feel like part of a bigger picture. Spontaneity is limited in turn, which brings me back to that gargantuan telescope now sitting in front of the library. Gazing at the stars means enduring a loading screen, and while I appreciate the top-level commands that I can issue to family members playing in other lots, simultaneously spending time with other sims means enduring even more loading screens, or forcing my family to travel together. I love looking at and listening to The Sims 4, but those little digital people aren't so enchanting as to keep me hooked--not when a decked-out version of The Sims 3 is far more inviting.""]"Brett Todd,9-Sep-14,NHL 15 Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/nhl-15-review/1900-6415866/,5,PS4,"[""One thing that has always annoyed me about sports games is feature creep.

EA Sports has ripped the heart out of its long-time arcade hockey game, taking what was supposed to be a brave first step for the franchise on the new-generation PS4 and Xbox One and turning it into a pratfall. Many, many modes of play are missing in action. Even the features that have survived EA's new-gen purge are present in much-reduced circumstances, with far fewer options than seen just last year with NHL 14 on the 360 and PS3. Some aspects of the game have been stripped down so much that they are barely playable. Action on the ice is still pretty impressive for the most part, and everything has been spruced up further with refined hockey smarts, improved puck physics, and mostly impressive new visuals and sound. But the gameplay isn't so much better that it offsets what has been lost. The only way that EA could further annoy hockey fans with this game would be if the company had Gary Bettman personally deliver every copy."", 'So much has been pulled out of NHL 15 that I spent my first 10 minutes with the game scavenging through the menus wondering where everything had been hidden. Even though I was well aware going in that the feature set had been scaled back, I still found it astonishing just how much was left out this year. When EA representatives say that they set everything back to square one to start over with the current generation of consoles, they really mean it. So, roll call. EA Sports Hockey League for online play? Gone. Online team play? Gone. Season mode? Gone. Tournaments and battling for the Stanley Cup? Gone. GM Connected? Gone. Be A Legend? Gone. Live the Life? Gone. Winter Classic? Gone. Ability to create teams and edit individual players? Gone and gone.', ""On launch day, you can consider the game gutted. Heck, you don't even get the three stars of the game awards right now, which is about as essential a part of the NHL hockey experience as broken teeth. Only the essential aspects of NHL gaming have been maintained. You can play individual matches both solo and offline with the NHL and pretty much every other major hockey league on the planet, and hit the ice to practice your moves (although you're stuck going one-on-one against a goalie, so there isn't much else you can do here except play showdown over and over again). Be a GM lets you run through up to 25 seasons at the helm of your favorite NHL club, which works quite a bit like a standard season mode in that you can sim or play games. Hockey Ultimate Team returns for more team-building and collectible fun (although I have always found this mode of play too gimmicky to fully enjoy). And that's pretty much it."", ""Just about everything that has been left in the game has been diminished in one way or another. In Be a GM, you are now limited solely to the NHL. All of the AHL, junior, and foreign teams have been removed. Your level of control has also been decreased. Drafts are all automated. Hit the end of a season, and the game essentially just gives you a bunch of random new prospects. The minor pro AHL is essentially gone here. You can see each team's farm club, but they mean nothing, and players sent down don't seem to record stats. There aren't even any preseason games. Not that I ever played them, but still. All of these missing features kill any sense of hockey realism. And Be a GM still isn't a good replacement for a pure season mode, as you're stuck with at least some of the financial and management duties that players might want to avoid."", ""Be a Pro is nearly unplayable now. In years past, I could barely stop playing Be a Pro. The combination of the role-playing, coaching input, and simply feeling like I was building a real NHL player hooked me for hours. In NHL 15, I couldn't get out of this mode of play fast enough."", ""The fantastic Memorial Cup tryout period--where you would improve your NHL draft position by kicking ass in the yearly Canadian tournament deciding the best major junior team in the world--has been yanked out of the game. Now you just create a player, gear him up, and either pick your favorite NHL club or let the game assign you to one randomly. You don't even have to worry about toiling in the AHL, as you stay in the NHL no matter what. This already makes the whole experience a lot less involving from a role-playing perspective, but it's even worse on the ice. Feedback from your coach at the end of every shift has been dropped--at least for now, as it is also being promised as a patch addition in September. At present, this ruins the whole mode of play for me, as without those direct comments, I feel like I'm playing in a vacuum. No matter what I do, from scoring a goal to screwing up and taking a bad penalty, I go back to the bench and am greeted with absolutely nothing. Without a coach there to praise or berate me, everything I do seems fake and pointless."", ""And to make everything just a little more aggravating, skipping forward is no longer allowed when you're on the bench waiting for your next shift. This time out you have to sit around and twiddle your thumbs until a whistle lets you get back out there. Games seem to have been sped up a bit to accommodate this missing option, however. It seems like you're on the ice a lot more than you should be, even if you're playing a top-six forward or top-pairing defenseman who already should be getting a lot of ice time. As a result, stats seem screwed up when it comes to key areas like shots on goal."", ""Customization is another area that has been cut way back. There is no way to create a player from scratch. Editing players is also verboten, which is a real shame in NHL 15 because some of the ratings are beyond bizarre. I noticed all sorts of strangeness, such as blue-chip rookies being projected to top out in the AHL, budding stars rated as mediocre, and relatively average talents being given elite rankings. Granted, a lot of this is in the eye of the beholder. But almost everyone is going to disagree with one player's ratings or another, so every modern sports game needs to allow for changes here. Unsurprisingly, the abilities to create plays and customize team strategies are also gone. You can't even mess around with new plays and strategies on your own, as the practice mode has been limited to one played going one-on-one with a goalie."", ""Which finally leads me to the on-ice action. Even with so many core features of NHL 15 deleted, a lot of this could be forgiven if the game was lights out on the ice. Unfortunately, it isn't. Or at least, not quite. This is still a very solid game of hockey (after you heavily adjust the gameplay sliders, as the default settings are ridiculously fast), complete with smart teammates and opponents on the ice. But it feels a lot like last year, with a few improvements due to revamped AI. Defenders are smarter. They play a smothering forecheck, stick close to their men (maybe too close, its sometimes like they've got you in a tractor beam), and adapt if you get predictable. Teams now seem to play more like their real-life inspirations than ever. The Minnesota Wild, for instance, play the exact same dump-and-chase style here as they do in the actual NHL, and rely on counter-attacking to win games. Offense is still a little off, though, due largely to the frequent presence of impossible plays. Too often I spotted star forwards like a Phil Kessel or a Patrick Kane doing something absurd, like snapping a no-look, lightning-fast backhand across the slot by barely moving their sticks. There are still too many tape-to-tape bullets and too much pinball puck movement resulting in supernatural feats of hockey not possible in the real world."", 'Just about everything that has been left in the game has been diminished in one way or another.', 'Improved physics make for more realism, as well. Skaters seem to have more heft. I could almost feel blades cutting into the ice, which gave skating more impact as compared to the slighter feel of earlier games in the series. The puck flies and bounces around more authentically, too. This is mostly noticeable around the nets, as the disc tends to carom off the goalie into corners, bounce high and over the net off the glass, create big fat rebounds into the slot, and so forth.', 'Given the new-generation focus of NHL 15, the visuals and sound should be real pluses. And they really are, at least for the most part. The new-generation graphics are particularly noteworthy when it comes to player faces. The game is getting close to photo-realism now, right down to specific facial expressions like smiles and grimaces when reacting to incidents on the ice. Arenas and crowds have both been completely redone. Rinks have been modeled on their specific counterparts in the real world, and the stands are now crammed with what seem to be thousands of individuals with different facial features, shirts, and so forth. This is often used to great effect. A fat guy in costume wearing a retro Winnipeg Jets sweater circa 1980 was twice shown in the Air Canada Centre stands taunting my Leafs after goals during a blowout, for example.', ""Other aspects of the visual presentation need refinement. Player models have been divided into different layers for body, equipment, and clothing. A new tech for cloth has been used for uniforms, which looks absurd given that jerseys now constantly flap around like Superman's cape. The ice looks a little off, especially when it comes to how clean sheets reflect the glare of arena lights. Everything is a bit too bright, more like you're standing on a desert highway at noon than looking at flooded ice in a modern arena. These are fairly minor points, though, that barely scratch the surface of one great-looking game."", 'Audio is also extremely good. Arena sound effects are powerful enough to rev you up during games. All of the atmospheric noises like the puck ratting off a post or the oomph of a big hit are right in your face. The new crowds are pretty mouthy, too. They react with cheers and jeers to good and bad plays. Even your hometown fans get on you and start booing if you allow a bad goal. Having such a lively crowd is vital this year, as well, because EA has really scaled back on the soundtrack. Generic rock fills the menus and most of the stoppages of play during games. Gone seem to be the days when the likes of The Black Keys and Judas Priest were prominently featured in NHL games.', 'NHL 15 moves to an NBC-styled broadcast presentation with Doc Emrick and Eddie Olczyk in the booth and Ray Ferraro chipping in from between the benches. This results in some of the best commentary in the history of the series, with a tremendous number of specific observations about players that really nail exactly what is going on during every game. Somebody has a great night, chances are awfully good that Ferraro will tell you all about it. The only occasional drawback is Emrick. He\'s an acquired taste already, to be sure, but some of his lines here have been stitched together so strangely that it sometimes sounds like English is his second language. I don\'t know how you create danger, nor do I understand what he means when he talks about a team ""recoiling,"" as he uses it in so many situations that it comes off as nothing but gobbledygook.', ""Even though NHL 15 plays a good game on the ice, the overall game is unconvincing and unfinished right now. EA could well deal with a number of these issues in the coming months, but it's hard to understand why the company would launch such a major franchise for the new consoles with such an incomplete effort. A lot of work is required over the next few months to get this promising game on track with all of the game features that series fans want and deserve.""]"Nick Capozzoli,7-Sep-14,Dead Rising 3 Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dead-rising-3-apocalypse-edition-review/1900-6415861/,3,PC,"['In the world of Harry Potter, where the laws of natural selection seem to favor whichever genes carry the most whimsy, there exists a species called a Boggart which takes on the appearance of your greatest fear, and is defeated by laughter. Unfortunately for the poor Boggart, there\'s also a spell that\'s laser-targeted on its ironic weakness, as Harry & co. discover in class. With the wave of a wand and the incantation ""riddikulus,"" a Boggart in the assumed form of a giant spider gets shod with eight roller skates. A snake Boggart gets magically transmogrified into a Jack-in-the-box, which is actually kinda creepier, really. Alan Rickman ends up in a dress for some reason. I haven\'t read the novels, so the movies are a bit confusing for me. But the lesson of the Boggart is a familiar one all the same--you can master the object of your fear by rendering it absurd.', 'Our Boggarts are all zombies these days. ""Walkers"" in The Walking Dead, ""infected"" in Resident Evil, ""vampires"" in The Strain...all scary in their own right, certainly, but a zombie outbreak also tends to reflect back to us our fears about modern society. We watch our umpteenth cubicle-dweller swallowed up by the horde and think--have we become too sedentary? We stare, as fragile alliances of survivors fracture over who should make the run for the flare gun in the pickup\'s glove compartment--would we sacrifice ourselves for our loved ones? Could the government be *that* corrupt? Has the selfie generation become too self-absorbed to survive the apocalypse? It\'s all getting a little heavy and a bit overwhelming and then--', '""Riddikulus!""', ""--suddenly there's Dead Rising, running zombies over with a lawnmower, hitting them with a gumball machine, jamming a shower head into their scalp that causes them to emit cranial fluids through the nozzle. Since the start of the last console generation, Capcom's brawler series has been one big clown nose on face of the undead, now three entries deep. The latest release--last year's Dead Rising 3--has been newly minted on PC, putting keyboard & mouse users in the jumpsuit of one Nick Ramos, Los Perdidos mechanic and nascent zombie-slayer. While the Apocalypse Edition is not the most lovingly crafted PC port around (locked at 30 frames per second and a tad jittery), the quality is agreeable enough, it supports controller or keyboard well, and the game's four downloadable content missions come bundled in."", 'The city of Los Perdidos is in a bad way. It\'s been all but given over to reanimated corpses, and as we join Ramos and his small band of leftovers, they\'re attempting to jury-rig a mode of transportation that\'ll get them out of Dodge. They\'re up against a fairly tight clock, but unless you\'re playing on the included ""Nightmare Mode,"" it\'s not so tight as to prevent Ramos from indulging in a copious amount of assorted clowning and speciously relevant errands for the city\'s other survivors. Collect three spray cans, find that lost briefcase, and could you stop by the pharmacy on the way back? Games with this sort of laissez-faire attitude on direction tend towards morally inconsistent, strangely acquiescent protagonists, and Dead Rising 3 is no exception. Take Ramos\' innocent, almost puppy-love sort of affection for a fellow member of his group, named Annie. When Annie flies the coop, he volunteers to capture and deliver her to a shadowy figure who wants her for some unknown end. A few scenes later, when it\'s revealed that Annie\'s part of a rebel band of ""Illegals"" (a real-world analogy that\'s invoked, then summarily ignored), Ramos is back by her side, and never a question is raised.', 'Ramos may only be marginally more perceptive than the shambling remains of the rest of the populace. But fortunately for him, the horde is less a threat than it is a slowly shifting, listless object to be acted upon--electrocuted en masse, perhaps, or paved over with a steamroller. As far as raisons d\'etre go, that\'s not much, even if Dead Rising 3\'s zombies get second billing to its unusual arsenal. The thrill of squishing them wears thin when you realize the extent of their haplessness--stand at the top of a ramp, and one after another will trip over the incline, forming a pile of dead undead without you so much as revving your chainsaw. Even a resurrected corpse deserves a little more agency than this, if only to make besting it a bit satisfying. Dead Rising 3 feels over-tuned to accommodate the players activity. Firing a weapon into the space between two zombies seems to consistently result in one of them getting hit. Player button presses feel prioritized in a way that makes the zombies appear almost deferential when you wade into their midst, brandished swordfish a-swingin\'. Its also quickly revealed that Ramos is immune to the bite, and you could say that this old chestnut represents a final breakage of the there but for the grace of God connection between survivor and shambler. Dead Rising 3s zombies, thusly neutered and fully divorced from their status as once-humans, can more comfortably sit in the crosshairs of say, a leaf-blower that fires ""personal massager"" missiles.', 'Not your cup of tea? Perhaps the sledgehammer with grenades duct taped to its head, then? How about the vehicle that shoots fireworks that pierce zombies and launch them into the sky? At one point I stumbled across a dictionary that can be weaponized. Well played there, Dead Rising 3: you know everyone\'s got that one item they\'d like to hit people with. There\'s a wonderfully diverse arsenal lying about, begging to be picked up and brandished by a curious player, and ad hoc weapons and vehicles can be thrown together with a few clicks of the mouse. It\'s a shame that these imaginative combinations can only be made once unlocked via collectible blueprints marked on your map, however. The tidy, rationed flow of blueprints kills the potential for creative discovery in favor of more prescriptive rewards. ""Here\'s a traffic cone"" Dead Rising 3 says, like a tween\'s exasperated parent, ""Go do something with the traffic cone.""', ""There's something of an evocation of Los Angeles' sprawl--four clusters of low-rise urban landscape connect via knotted highway ramps. But it feels too staged, too self-contained, and it quickly begins to feel like you're a lab rat, cycling around the same track, turning in the same colored blocks for the same pieces of cheese. Take a ride on one of the long-spanning causeways, and you can see the dead-zones to either side: empty plots of land at the corners of the intersections, cordoned off by barricades. There's a wearying amount of roadblocks in the playable space too, and they rarely divert you into interesting areas. Mostly they break up the flow of driving, which becomes immediately obnoxious when some errand inevitably forces you to commute back and forth between multiple districts. There is some clever staging, like an open-air fireworks store you just might blow through while driving a low-rider full of loose fuel tanks. But these exceptions make the larger blandness all the more conspicuous."", 'But hey, there sure are a lot of zombies. Many of Dead Rising 3\'s most enduring images come when you stand atop some burned-out car, surveying the field of hundreds of on-screen undead with their arms outstretched. You\'re a post-apocalyptic rock star, sometimes, and maybe you\'re even wielding a proper axe. Yet Dead Rising 3 reiterates the common lesson of zombie fiction: that in a world where the majority of the population eats brains, the salient dangers are still posed by your fellow man. In the long view, that danger comes from the power-mad general who\'ll be nuking Los Perdidos in six days. But in the here-and-now, the biggest threats come from the game\'s various human bosses. ""Psychopath battles,"" as the game dubs them.', ""These fights are demonstrably harder than any zombified creature Ramos runs up against. There's even a cutscene where a new, frankly terrifying zombie type is revealed, and, lo and behold, when control is handed back to you it's mysteriously gone, later revealed to be a new enemy type that simply populates the streets--marginally tougher than the normal fodder, but equally susceptible to a flame-throwing steamrollercycle, as it turns out. The humans you fight, by contrast, are veritable bullet-sponges, and just intelligent enough to employ frustrating stun-locks that bounce Nick around the battleground, or charge moves that home in with a will. They all seem to pack multiple health meters. Scary stuff."", 'They\'re uniformly miserable encounters, and it isn\'t just because they\'re chock full of clumsy, tired mechanics that overtax Dead Rising 3\'s loose, brawler controls. One psychopath is a Chinese man, bearded and dressed as a monk, fought in a temple garden, who attacks you with a medieval polearm and kung fu. The game stops just short of playing ""Chopsticks"" as an accompaniment (but it does ring a gong). One is a sexualized policewoman wearing a Halloween-costume version of the uniform. One is a female bodybuilder that the developers, through Ramos, gleefully misgender. Another is a chap-wearing bisexual man in a pink cowboy hat. He has a phallic flamethrower.', ""Is there a Harry Potter fan in the audience? Maybe one with a good command of the series' bestiary? Because I think what we have here is a Boggart, reflecting back someone's subconscious fears about minorities. And to conquer those fears, they've cast a mean-spirited spell to turn the things that frighten them into ridiculous caricatures. It's a cruel portrayal, and superfluous besides: in a game that's ostensibly about zombies, shouldn't the zombies be scary enough on their own?""]"Shaun McInnis,5-Sep-14,Dance Central Spotlight Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dance-central-spotlight-review/1900-6415864/,8,Xbox One,"[""If the two Rock Band sequels were products of a rhythm game arms race, each installment growing heavier with added features and increased track counts, then Dance Central Spotlight is a move in the opposite direction. Here, Harmonix has pared its stylish Kinect dancing franchise down to its most essential elements, ditching the time-traveling story mode of Dance Central 3 in favor of a renewed focus on the dance routines that sit at the very heart of the game. But it's slimmed down in other ways, too, with a $10 core game serving as the gateway to a musical storefront brimming with reasonably priced songs to build out your own customized library. What's left is a lean but immensely enjoyable dancing game, one that goes out of its way to remove the barriers between you and shaking it on the dance floor."", 'Dance Central Spotlight is more akin to a downloadable starter pack than a full retail product. The core game comes with 10 songs, a genre-spanning assortment of recent hits that ranges from the soulful pop of Lorde\'s ""Royals"" to the infectious house rhythm of David Guetta\'s ""Titanium."" Every one of these songs carries on Dance Central\'s tradition of excellent choreography, with inventive dance routines and lively animations bringing each song to life. But where Dance Central Spotlight differs from its predecessors is in the amount of content each song provides.', ' ', ""Whereas earlier games offered one routine per song, which then layered in tougher moves as you climbed up each difficulty level, Dance Central Spotlight goes a step further. Actually, make that several steps. See, every song in the game now offers that same primary routine with four difficulty settings, but now you also get two alternate routines as well as much more strenuous cardio and strength exercise routines. These aren't mere variations; they're entirely different dance numbers. As a result, each song has become its own rabbit hole of grooving and shaking, giving you an enormous incentive to dive right back in as soon as the music's over so that you can continue to experience those new moves."", ""That said, the dancing itself is the same as ever. You follow cue cards scrolling along the screen, attempting to mirror the game's impossibly hip assortment of playable characters as they shimmy and shake in various ways. No matter how well you do, it's tough not to find a smile creeping across your face. From the vivid presentation to the consistently outstanding choreography, the simple act of dancing makes Dance Central Spotlight some of the purest fun you can have on an Xbox One."", ""But there is one irksome quality to the game's tried-and-true formula. Do well and you'll see the screen explode in a fireworks display of light and color, with score combos and star ratings going out of their way to tell you just how hard you're nailing it. But botch a move and all you get is a red outline on your character's limbs--the same feedback system that's been used since day one."", ""That minimalist feedback has always been nice because of how non-invasive it is, allowing you to keep having a blast even if you happen to be making a real hash of Rihanna's latest single. But in Dance Central Spotlight, it's a bit at odds with itself. That's because Dance Central Spotlight's progression system requires you to unlock new dance routines by collecting flawless performances on various dance moves. Generally speaking, this system is pretty forgiving; there are so many dance moves to collect that you never really hit a brick wall in terms of progression. But in those instances where a trickier dance move just doesn't click with you, it's hard to tell exactly what you're doing wrong."", ""Nonetheless, other improvements to the dancing experience ease the process of learning new moves. Now you can pause mid-song and jump into a quick practice mode, running through a move over and over again--even slowing it down if you prefer--until you feel comfortable with it. Once you've got it, you can pick up right where you left off. No need to jump out to the main menu and launch a separate practice mode."", ""In fact, Dance Central Spotlight is pretty light on extraneous game modes altogether. There is a neat little fitness mode that lets you design a custom playlist of routine types, set the overall length of your dance session, and then see how many calories you've burned according to your height and weight. But beyond that, there's the song store and little else."", ""But even without the delightfully silly story mode and assorted minigames of its predecessor, Dance Central Spotlight's core offering still delivers a tremendous value. For a mere $10, you get an album's worth of songs that all feature five distinct routines to learn. What's nice is that each song you buy from the store--which run for $2 each, with some bundles offering a small discount--also offer the same generous assortment of choreographies. So whether you end up spending another $10 or $40, the library you assemble gives you plenty of ways to shake it while simultaneously reflecting your own musical tastes."", ""Indeed, Dance Central Spotlight feels like an admission that sometimes you just can't be all things to all people. Rather than beef up the feature list, Harmonix has taken the opposite approach: it's slimmed down the game, offered way more value, and removed the obstacles between you and just getting out there and dancing. It's a different take on Dance Central, but the party is just as fun as ever.""]"Josiah Renaudin,4-Sep-14,The Last Tinker: City of Colors Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-last-tinker-city-of-colors-review/1900-6415860/,5,PS4,"['The Last Tinker: City of Colors is a mottled blur of mechanics done better in other games. Brightly painted backdrops and a creatively rich world lay a thick primer of promise on the canvas, but as you grow familiar with the automated platforming and raise an eyebrow to the stuttering framerate, the jagged brushstrokes begin to show. The story and surrounding visual elements carry their fair share of charm, but a ho-hum combat system paired with lackluster puzzles drag down this otherwise imaginative experience.', ""From the start, it's clear that The Last Tinker is trying to mimic the best '90s platformers. The expressive characters chirp and tut as they speak, harking back to classics like Banjo-Kazooie, while the anamorphic protagonist would fit in with a crowd of nimble mascots from generations past. Tinkerworld is coated with reds, blues, and greens that make you question if you should adjust your TV's contrast, and you can't take more than five steps without stumbling into a pyramid of boxes begging to be punched."", ""The Last Tinker has the superficial trappings of those successful 3D platformers, but lacks elegance in its execution. Instead of giving you the ability to jump from ridge to ridge manually, The Last Tinker presents equidistant platforms that you can cross by simply running forward. Correct timing is often necessary, as floating boxes or scalable tentacles might submerge if you're too slow. However, there's little challenge associated with traversing the environment. Seamlessly swinging across canyons looks like a thrill, but the short-lived excitement that goes along with the weighty sense of movement isn't enough to replace the satisfaction of landing a well-timed jump. The combat doesn't fare much better, as rudimentary combinations that require little more than simple button mashing are often the easiest solution to the busy encounters. Purchasable upgrades and additional abilities earned through story progress spice up an otherwise elementary system, but there just isn't much here to sink your teeth into."", 'Despite its artistic aptitude, The Last Tinker lacks identity.', ""Beyond punching, dodging, and countering, your hairy hero can cause enemies to run away in fear, as well as stun them for a short period of time to provide openings for finishing blows. Stringing your strikes together by dashing from target to target can lead to fleeting fun, but once you're in the thick of the action, the paltry framerate disrupts your flow. The Last Tinker struggles to deliver a smooth experience even in its quieter moments; just walking across an empty street can cause the game to stutter annoyingly. These instances are manageable, but the busier sections consistently bend the game toward its breaking point."", ""The technical failings are a shame, since the prismatic scenery can be truly dazzling when it's presented at a steady clip. Tinkerworld is coated in color, with each district supporting a particular shade. The red, green, and blue districts all have their own styles and unique citizens, and while they were once able to coexist, color-based prejudices have drawn sharp lines between the groups. The sudden outbreak of bleakness that leaves previously vibrant locations windswept quiets the bickering, but it's really up to the hero Koru to bring the guardian spirits of each district together against a common enemy."", ""It's predictable, but cute. The Last Tinker never surprises you with its dialogue or plot points, but the story is a satisfactory complement to the visual flair. It's just a shame that the actual interactive part of the game never goes beyond being adequate. When you're not punching or jumping, you're often faced with dull puzzles that have you guiding a dopish mushroom creature from place to place. The additional powers you unlock over time give you a wider range of interactions with this companion, and that leads to more varied and complex riddles. Still, none of the puzzles are too demanding, and you'll often find that the greater challenge comes from keeping the mushroom at your side rather than discovering the solution."", ""Despite its artistic aptitude, The Last Tinker lacks identity. The combat is remedial, the platforming is robotic, and the puzzles are little more than frustrating roadblocks that fail to mystify. The florid environments you'll jump through give Koru's journey a hint of personality, but the medley of tired, unpolished mechanics come together to form a forgettable, shapeless package.""]"Daniel Starkey,4-Sep-14,Velocity 2X Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/velocity-2x-review/1900-6415859/,9,PS4,"[""Velocity 2X is interactive poetry. All of its pieces, all of its movements, all of its systems and mechanics flow seamlessly into and out of one another to create a constant tone of movement and a feeling of endless flow. A mistimed jump, a poorly placed shot, and even death are merely delays; brief hurdles in your pursuit of a perfect run. Velocity's influences are clear from the outset--Metroid, Mario, and countless classic shoot-em-ups. Molding such disparate genres together isn't easy, but Velocity manages to create a tight, focused experience with a stunning level of finesse."", ""At any given point you could be at the helm of a blazing-fast ship equipped with the ability to teleport anywhere, or you could be running around as a not-so-subtle reference to Metroid's Samus Aran--arm cannon and all. Velocity 2X opens with the capture of protagonist, Kai. Shortly thereafter, she undergoes numerous cybernetic experiments, giving her an extraordinary set of abilities. Even without a complex or gritty narrative, Kai's arc as a protagonist is still sympathetic. She regularly flashes between aggressive, sassy, humorous, and even nostalgic. Phenomenal artwork that is crisp and prismatic helps reinforce that broad emotional spectrum. Cel-shading mixed with some clever lighting gives Kai and the world she inhabits a palpable sense of weight and presence. Velocity 2X pulls heavily from its 2D inspirations, but adds distinct visual layers that give the environments depth. That flair effectively communicates both the emotional context for any given scene and helps highlight obstacles to you so that you can keep up your momentum without having to pick through convolution."", ' ', ""Velocity offer more than impressive visuals, though. The early stages introduce each gameplay type separately so that you can familiarize yourself with how each works. Later, once you've mastered them, it blends all of these ideas together while doling out unique twists. That's critical, too, because the game is layered and nuanced to such a degree that it takes an entire campaign to move from comfortable to fluent with all of its mechanics. Velocity 2X uses a novel approach by using the entire game as a tutorial and subsequent runs as the challenge. That only works because there's a steady progression that runs throughout. Each stage feels like an incremental step up in difficulty that loops back around to the beginning areas. Perfectly finishing an early level is substantially harder than merely completing one of the later ones, and that helps you feel like you're still growing and learning the second time. The unfortunate side effect of that approach is that the finale lacks the appropriate thematic climax. Tension is constantly ratcheted higher and higher, but there's no release at the end--just another loop. It's a small issue, but it's also the only thing holding Velocity 2X from utter perfection."", ""The first few areas teach basic ship movement. From there, Velocity 2X folds in its brand of teleportation, which is a lightning fast flick-based affair. It's a novel way to move throughout your environment. Walls fall away and your path through any given level takes on another dimension. It does take some getting used to, however. Initially I felt like I was haphazardly bouncing around. The harsh sound of a warp and the smooth animation make these micro-jumps consistently satisfying, but I didn't realize how beautiful that could be until my second round. Starting a jump requires careful aiming, and when you're racing through a new section it's easy to mess that up and accidentally kill yourself. That doesn't matter though, because death is never a big deal. You respawn quickly, losing little more than a second or two most of the time. On the second, third, or fourth time through, you'll have become familiar enough with the area to plan and calculate warps rapidly that are safe but imprecise. That's supported by a forgiving aiming system that favors snaps of the joystick over meticulous targeting. Latter levels will have you play as Kai on foot, where there are even more environmental dangers. To compensate, teleportation works only at set distances for each of the four cardinal directions, and keeps the action-platforming from becoming unnecessarily lethal. When combined with the dashes and jumps introduced later, movement in Velocity 2X becomes an elegant system for expression. Dashing, shooting, jumping, and more help flesh out the later stages."", ' ', ""After the pieces have been introduced and tested in controlled environments, Velocity 2X starts combining them in increasingly complex sequences with longer, sometimes labyrinthine challenges. Telepods allow you to set up long range warp points, and they facilitate puzzles that have you completing some parts before flashing back to the beginning to take an alternate route. It's a brilliant system that creates controlled bursts of backtracking without the monotony that often follows. In one level, literally called The Labyrinth, you'll have to set up these points across the map and warp back repeatedly as you unlock new zones. It sounds slow and tedious, but teleportation is integrated so smoothly and completely that it always feels perfect, maintaining that core focus on speed and momentum."", ' ', ""That constant pressure to move forward and be faster creates micro risk/reward moments. You can't dash while also using your main arm cannon when on foot. You still have access to a larger rifle that can only fire left or right. That mechanic forces you to sacrifice speed for protection or vice versa, and encourages you to put yourself in danger to move just a bit faster. Similarly, while in the ship, your boost pushes the whole map upwards. Holding that speed can catch you on ledges, killing you as the screen continues to scroll. The trade-off provides depth and enough emergent variety to keep every run on nearly every level fresh. Each of Velocity 2X's ingredients are basic in themselves. Shooting down enemy ships isn't interesting on its own, but when combined with an exceptional system for movement and tied to an omnipresent clock, it feels truly special."", ' ', 'A mistimed jump, a poorly placed shot, and even death is merely a delay; a brief hurdle in your pursuit of a perfect run.', ""You feel the running theme of momentum constantly. Velocity builds its play to feel uninterrupted. Death isn't a mark of failure. Shifting between story and play isn't marked by a shift in background music. Fractions of a second separate ship combat and platforming. Sleek animations and consistent frame rates graphically sell the motif. Players can shift seamlessly between the PS4 and the Vita, and Velocity 2X is just as gorgeous and just as fluid on both. There's never a dropped beat, never a moment where you aren't moving, and you can always be faster."", ' ']"Peter Brown,28-Aug-14,Azure Striker Gunvolt Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/azure-striker-gunvolt-review/1900-6415858/,8,3DS,"[""In Azure Striker: Gunvolt, you charge through a series of missions in the order of your choosing within a colorful 2D world, contending with pitfalls and robo-fodder until you engage in a boss battle confined to a single screen arena, and if you're successful, you're rewarded with a new type of gun. So, yes, it shares a few things in common with Mega Man. But, what I've just described is in effect an armature, a skeleton, and the game that's designed around it, which forms its own identity through experimental mechanics and an electric, eye-catching presentation, is a fast-paced ride and a fantastic side-scrolling action experience. Although the main mission path isn't difficult to finish, completing Gunvolt's optional trials and seeing everything through to the end will challenge and please even the most hardened veteran looking for a fresh, Mega Man-like experience."", ""The story behind young Gunvolt's charge takes cues from X-Men's cautionary tale of mutant discrimination and Final Fantasy VII's energy-monopolizing megacorporation, Shinra Electric Power Company. Sumeragi, an ancient order that's seized control of the world's energy supply, is using captive adepts--people with special powers who were once feared by humanity--to control its slice of the economy. Gunvolt's an adept with the ability to control electricity, and before being rescued and initiated the ranks of the resistance group, QUILL, he was one of Sumeragi's prisoners. The story definitely takes a backseat to the action, but with self-aware writing and an array of strong personalities, you'll get a kick out of the game's story sequences even if it doesn't grip you on an emotional level."", ""Gunvolt comes from Inti Creates, a team with twelve years of Mega Man games under its belt, so it's not surprising that a gun is central to the action in Gunvolt. Thankfully, the flow of action deviates from your traditional run-and-gun side-scroller, which is a pleasant surprise given that you still, for the most part, run to the right while firing a pistol. Rather than firing bullets in the traditional sense, your sidearm shoots metallic tags that allow the lightning from Gunvolt's spherical Flashfield to arc across the screen and inflict damage. Since you'll drain your fuel reserves--known as EP--after a few seconds, you can't keep it activated indefinitely. Deplete your EP meter and you'll overheat, which delays the amount of time before the auto-recharge effect kicks in. You have the ability to recharge it on the fly by double tapping the directional pad, but only if the field is disabled and you haven't already overheated. During a frantic barrage of incoming fire, this is easier said than done."", ""Quickly and cleanly soaring through missions while managing your EP levels is a dance that takes time to master, but every little bit of progress pays off in the rankings and rewards you receive at the end of each mission. The ranking you receive, in addition to the number of collectible medallions you find during each mission, give you chances to reveal squares on a grid representing different materials at the end of a level, though you only get to walk away with one per mission. These materials are used to synthesize new equipment that alter Gunvolt's movement abilities and EP expenditure, and as you progress, taking advantage of these possibilities make Gunvolt a more adept soldier, and the hunt for higher rankings that much more enjoyable."", 'Quickly and cleanly soaring through missions while managing your EP levels is a dance that takes time to master...', ""Though you earn a new type of pistol for each boss you defeat, new weapons simply introduce new paths for your tag bullets or increase the number of tags that you can interact with at a given time. There's room to master the intricacies of each, but you're better off focusing on improving the speed of your game and the destructiveness of your Flashfield. By stringing together consecutive attacks on enemies without taking damage, the amount of experience you earn increases. The faster you level up, the sooner you unlock new offensive or recovery skills that become critical tools during more challenging boss battles. They're often powerful, with some capable of fully recharging your health or cutting a boss's health in half, but with only three, slowly recharging skill points to spend at any given time, it's impossible to abuse the more powerful skills that eat up two points at once. If you need some extra help, however, there's an optional roll-of-the-dice that you can initiate between levels that gives you the chance for a one time revival upon death during your next outing, which also gives Gunvolt an EP meter that never drains and a mid-air jump that never tires."", ""Gunvolt can be challenging at times, but these moments are limited to endgame boss battles and optional skill trials, the latter of which are necessary for obtaining some of the rarer synth materials. Some early trials are a walk in the park, but the challenges that follow are incredibly demanding, and one slip up can make the difference between a successful or failed attempt. Playing with the equipment and crafting system can make things easier, but you quickly find that completing challenges, more than the main mission path, is the ultimate sign of mastering Gunvolt's abilities."", ""It's enjoyable to be able to breeze through the main game while learning how to wield Gunvolt's abilities with newfound confidence, but considering that most levels can be completed in about ten minutes, and there are just over ten to explore, it's also a bit deflating when the game runs out of new things for you to see. The challenges and the hunt for hidden items are worthwhile endeavors that will encourage you to play for a few additional hours, but you're still repeatedly retracing your steps, and this is Gunvolt's only downfall. That's not to say you won't find yourself going back in for just one more run, but this take on the core Mega Man formula ultimately runs out of new scenarios quicker than it deserves to given how exciting and fun it is to play.""]"Miguel Concepcion,27-Aug-14,Dark Souls II Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dark-souls-2-crown-of-the-old-iron-king-review/1900-6415857/,8,Xbox 360 & PS3,"[""The worlds of the Souls games have consistently excelled in conveying a sense of history. There's the impression that their castles and other fortifications have changed ownership by various invaders many times over. The kingdom of Drangleic in Dark Souls II not only feels ancient, but haunted as well. In the Crown of the Old Iron King add-on, the ashen bodies that litter the open spaces of Brume Tower effectively echo the flash-heated victims of Pompeii. Merely touching them casts their fragile shapes into the wind, which is inevitable given that they're littered around the game's fields of battle. Dark Souls might be punishing, but it doesn't punish you for disrespecting the departed, not surprising for a series that encourages the player to embrace death."", ""Whereas the South-American-inspired temple in Sunken King helped give the first DLC an aptly disconnected feel from the main game, there's a sense that Old Iron King is meant as natural extension of Iron Keep. It's as if Brume Tower were the original mine and furnace of Drangleic, and Iron Keep were built as the fancier upgrade. It explains the lack of moving parts in the map's various towers. In a land strewn with large misplaced gears and other clockwork pieces, Brume Tower is both antiquated and charming. It's of little surprise that recovering the towers' keys and switches make up many of this DLC's objectives. These towers, by the way, are impressively intricate and are more involving than Dark Souls II's other vertical areas, like The Pit. Brume Tower feels like a fortification built around its towers as opposed to the other way around."", ""The settings of Crown of the Old Iron King are both fantastical and relatable, but nowhere near practical. Gigantic suits of armor hang inexplicably under elevator platforms, hinting that humans10 times normal size once protected Drangleic. A part of me laughs at the sight of enormous chain link bridges made of actual chains. I nervously get the camera angle just right so I don't fall off and wonder if I'll have to endure combat on these narrowest of bridges. From Software would be cruel enough to subject us to such tribulations. As it turns out, you won't have to fight anyone on these chains, unless you lack foresight and lure an enemy there yourself. At that point, any deaths on the chains are all on you."", 'Explore thoroughly enough and you eventually find Iron Passage. Given its cavernous, yet tight spaces and its deep roster of demons, this optional area is a clear follow-up to the Cave of the Dead from Crown of the Sunken King. These caves would be the most challenging sections of the Lost Crowns trilogy if not for the two helpful phantoms you can summon. This cavernous journey concludes with a duel against a blue variant of the Smelter Demon, further underscoring the uninspired boss designs of these expansions. Same goes for Fume Knight, a mandatory opponent in Brume Tower who dual-wields melee weapons not unlike The Pursuer and Old Dragonslayer.', ""If you seek variety, look to Old Iron King's lesser foes. Agile assassins exhibit talents with small blades, lightning spells, and short distance teleportation, so killing them feels all the more gratifying. The most frightening group of creatures appears around the DLC's halfway point: portly humanoids that crawl toward you due to their missing legs. They're especially creepy when they charge at you and self-destruct in an explosion of flame. Picture the legless T-800 at the end of The Terminator mixed with the fireballs in the Final Fantasy series."", 'In Iron Keep, there was an odd ease and simplicity in dipping a group of enemies into a lethal pool of lava by the pull of a switch. Similar conveniences appear in this DLC, provided you\'re able to spot these situational tricks before you fall victim to these traps yourself. Brume Tower is populated with mutants who carry barrels of explosive and flammable liquid. Their bow-legged movement makes them look scarier than they actually are. Their non-hostile behavior should be your first clue of their usefulness. Much like the windmill puzzle in Dark Souls II, this DLC provides its share of ""Ah-ha!"" moments, which almost always reveal themselves as you continue to explore and take stock of your surroundings.', ""I've grown to be that person who can stand in an old building and envision the ghosts of those who have roamed its halls. It's an achievement when a digital environment can trigger similar meditations, something that the Souls games have pulled off time and time again. From Software is keenly aware of this, as evidenced by a memorable, and more importantly, playable flashback sequence of Dark Souls II. What is noteworthy about Crown of the Old Iron King is how it conveys a deep sense history without the help of a flashback. Its slumbering defenses await your arrival, just as they have for countless heroes before and for those who'll follow in your footsteps. It's these guardians who act as the connective tissue between past and present, formidable as always.""]"Brett Todd,26-Aug-14,The Walking Dead: Season Two - A Telltale Games Series Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-walking-dead-season-two-episode-five-no-going-/1900-6415856/,7,PC,"[""Season two of Telltale Games' The Walking Dead adventures ends with more whimper than bang. No Going Back caps the latest five-episode series with a surprisingly muted installment that eases up on the pedal that was once pushed right to the floor. Dialogue drives the proceedings and zombies are relegated to mere cameo appearances, and though I would have preferred a little more action and a lot more zombies, the atmosphere was so laced with an undercurrent of doom that I was constantly on the edge of my chair. Heartbreaking moments that underlined the quiet desperation driving each character, and the way that choices had a huge impact on the final resolution of the story, pushed the episode past its flaws toward a moving and fitting conclusion to a journey I was utterly invested in."", 'Still, color me conflicted. A number of aspects of No Going Back bothered me while playing, and they continue to bother me hours later. Plotting featured a number of moments that defied logic. The opening Mexican standoff with the Russians, for instance, was intense but also vaguely nonsensical, with everyone blasting away at each other from close distances like the trash-can-alley gunfights made famous by Police Squad. Fortunately, the entire scene was nicely rescued by a fittingly brutal ending accompanied by a summarily brutal gunshot execution. All the nihilism of the entire Walking Dead series was summed up in a few bleak seconds.', ""Characterizations can be odd, depending on the choices that you make. One associate may turn on Clementine over a life-or-death decision, which is out of character given the relationship that the two have developed; the dialogue choices don't even allow Clem to defend her actions, which are entirely reasonable. All of the sympathy shown for another companion throughout the episode seems wholly misplaced, given the opening gunfight and related actions that clearly reveal that not everyone in the group can be trusted. Yet another compatriot displays a number of irrational moments of her own; her choices are meant to reveal key truths, but in practice, they prompt an understandable, if violent, reaction. Some reactions seem contrived or overblown simply to foster conflict, and while I could see the group eventually coming to blows, one particular story beat was rushed and lacked a necessary trigger incident."", ""Still, No Going Back is not without significant storytelling prowess. Clementine's maturity is a highlight, as is her sisterly relationship with a close confidante. They share some moving moments, as do Clem and Kenny: A campfire scene at the power station is one of the most touching of the season, providing brief hope for the group while still leaving their precarious situation up in the air."", ""These quiet moments build significant tension. I was forever waiting for the other shoe to drop while the group hiked towards a house stocked with food and other supplies, because I suspected either a major zombie herd attack, or the arrival of more Russian goons with heavy firepower. It's a good thing that nerves are kept constantly on edge, as action scenes and interactions are typically confined to grisly but simple actions like moving keys to mimic cleaning Kenny's ugly eye wound. The most riveting action scene involves a zombie attack while the group is crossing the thin ice of a river, which leads to particularly ghastly consequences."", 'The rising tension culminates in a fittingly vicious showdown that serves as a final test for the ever-maturing Clementine. Your ultimate choices have a tremendous impact on who lives, who dies, and how the episode concludes. Your decisions here mean more than ever before in the series, and I am dreadfully curious to learn how Telltale handles the next steps; given the circumstances, it seems impossible for season three to pick up where this one left off.', ""Walking Dead's whimpers are more satisfying than other game's bangs, and No Going Back remains quite satisfying despite some miscues. This messy ending is an appropriate way to wrap a season that evolved into a morality play loaded with grim, philosophical musings about what it means to be a human being, whether you're struggling to survive in a zombie apocalypse or simply learning how to get by in the real world.""]"Josiah Renaudin,26-Aug-14,Madden NFL 15 Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/madden-nfl-15-review/1900-6415855/,7,Xbox One & PS4,"[""Last year's Madden 25 didn't feel like the franchise's true next-generation debut. Inconsistent production values, holes in the passing game, and mechanical stagnation made what many had hoped to be a fresh start seem stuck in the mud. Thankfully, Madden 15 corrects the course by taking two big steps in the right direction. Firstly, revamped defensive play gives you a reason to actively participate as you defend a drive; secondly, precise attention to detail creates a more cohesive aesthetic package. Deficiencies in the passing game along with technical hiccups stemming from the game's often-comical physics still exist, but Madden 15's few missteps do little to detract from an otherwise strong outing."", 'Controlling the defense has felt like an afterthought in recent years, since your actions as an active defender rarely made an impact on the progression of the play. But Madden 15 focuses on making it fun to play both sides of the ball. The most immediate change youll notice is a camera angle positioned behind whichever defender you control. If youre on the line, youre asked to time your attack to the centers snap and fight your way through traffic to take out the quarterback. Favorable matchups allow you to slink past the offense through timely button presses, and once youve broken through, youre given a handy visual indicator to illustrate your tackling range. The safest route is to use the more reserved tackle that almost guarantees an easy sack, but you can also make use of the less accurate hit stick if youre feeling lucky. This has a greater chance of popping the ball free or even causing a game-changing injury.', 'If youre looking to force interceptions, controlling a member of the secondary remains advantageous since youre more likely to pick off a pass when youre in the drivers seat, rather than when trusting the AI. The behind-the-back view that works so well for a pass rusher is disorienting when you swing over to a safety or cornerback, but on-the-fly adjustments allow you to switch to the classic camera angle thats more advantageous in these circumstances. Still, youre more equipped to defend passes than ever before as long as long as you stay tight on a receiver, and barreling through a strong offensive line to drag a top quarterback to the ground is supremely satisfying. Systems that previously felt automated now require your undivided attention, giving you more reasons to stay engaged in all four quarters of a game.', 'When it comes to offensive play, the changes are more often seen than felt. The interface for picking plays has been revamped, cleaning up much of the previous clutter and giving you helpful information about suggested calls. Less-seasoned players who prefer to just settle for suggested plays often had little idea why short passes were more effective when the defense was about to blitz, or how one run play was likely to produce more positive yards over another. The logic behind the choices was hidden, but Madden 15 provides an explanation for the more casual football strategist. Coachs suggestions are coupled with text that might mention how the opposing team is often vulnerable to a particular play during a specific down, while additional plays often used by the community show success rate and average yards gained. Experienced players will likely choose their own formation and offensive maneuvers, but taking the games advice is both viable and edifying.', 'Favorable matchups allow you to slink past the offense through timely button presses, and once youve broken through, youre given a handy visual indicator to illustrate your tackling range.', ""The running game made considerable strides last year thanks to the improved interaction between the offensive and defensive lines, and it only feels sharper this time around. Breaking tackles, finding holes, and trucking past defenders looks and feels great, and the different attributes of each player--whether it be their acceleration or physical strength--are felt as soon as the ball is snapped. Pass plays, on the other hand, can lead to some frustrations. You have a great deal of finesse with the ball when taking control of a QB, as youre able to throw bullet passes, lobs, and lead receivers if the coverage is tight. Receivers even make more creative catches than ever before, as its not uncommon to see daring one-handed grabs or long dives for passes just out of reach. But interceptions happen too often, and even the strongest receivers just dont do enough to battle for the ball. Good defenders frequently prevent great receivers from making plays in single-coverage situations, so battling an adept secondary like Seattle's can feel like a lost cause."", 'The vanilla Play Now and online Head-to-Head modes are there for the exploring, and theyre the best way to go if you just some want to throw on some pads and take to the field. But Connected Franchise is quickly becoming a feature attraction, and its been given a bit of a facelift this year. Here, you choose between becoming a player, owner, or coach of your favorite franchise, which gives you the power to either affect the flow of individual games or get deeply involved in the teams upkeep. The newest additions are a Game Prep feature and a statistic for individual player confidence. Game Prep provides different activities during a given week that give you more experience to sharpen your skills, while confidence takes into account the ups and downs even veterans feel from week to week.', ""Both add variety to the routine, providing more to do as a created player before the next big game rolls around. However, some of the Game Prep drills involve nothing more than selecting a player and immediately earning the additional points without even running a play. The interactive options arent much better, giving you simple objectives that vary depending on the position you play. A QB might need to complete four passes against a cover 1 defense, while a receiver could be asked to catch a ball in traffic. The confidence is a nice real-world touch, but it doesn't feel particularly impactful during your Super Bowl campaigns."", ""Madden Ultimate Team is where I spent most of my time, but its structure is difficult to swallow. You create your fantasy team by opening booster packs bought with either in-game money or real cash. Solo challenges earn you coins and unlock full games with the possibility of greater monetary rewards, and the streamlined interface makes it easier than ever to slot in your best players to build a better team. However, the pacing of progression is too slow if youre unwilling to whip out your wallet. Challenges just dont earn a sufficient number of coins, so youre left playing game after game with a team barely fit to take the field. Just throwing down a couple of bucks to expedite the process is tempting, turning what could be Madden's best mode into a microtransaction scheme."", 'Interceptions happen too often, and even the strongest receivers just dont do enough to battle for the ball.', ""Even if you never go beyond the Play Now mode, the mechanical improvements on offense and defense make Madden 15 worth a look--as do the impressive visuals. Muscles bulge and beads of sweat spray across the turf as you drive against the opposition, and unlike in previous games, the athletes are highly distinctive. Individual player quirks, like Johnny Manziel's slippery, sporadic rushing style, are much more pronounced, and the crowds are not nearly as static as in previous years. Its a technically stunning game, and the increased attention to detail--such as Packers fans bellowing John Kuhns last name as he makes big plays--goes a long way toward making this a real NFL experience."", 'Players still awkwardly fall over each other as plays conclude and receivers are too often outmatched by similarly skilled corners, but even so, Madden 15 is the spark that this series needed. Controlling players on defense finally feels both fun and functional, and more informative playcalling gives newer players context for the technical side of the game. The feature set remains fundamentally unchanged, but each of the core modes have increased in breadth and decreased in clutter, making it easy to dig into features that might have seemed too dense from a distance. Madden 15 looks sharper than ever, but its biggest achievement is its dedication to improving core systems that have held the series back in the past.']"Nick Capozzoli,26-Aug-14,Firefall Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/firefall-review/1900-6415854/,5,PC,"['I know that Firefall is a massively multiplayer online game, because my first steps in it are dogged by another human player who deliberately places himself--for the better part of an hour--directly in front of my face any time I stand still. I know that Firefall is also a shooter, because any screen space not immediately occupied by this most ancient of trolling rituals is devoted to a very large gun, and this gun is the sole consignee of that all-important left mouse click. And I know that Firefall is a role-playing game, because my quests involve traveling to far-flung fields and perforating ten of whatever I find there.', 'That\'s a bit glib, I know. But would that I could leave it at that. Because while it\'s true Firefall doesn\'t outright botch its social scene, shooting, or role-playing elements, each is marked by that perfunctory sort of execution that always defies criticism. There\'s nothing fun or thought-provoking about designating these things ""standard,"" so let\'s table them for the moment and instead talk about the thing I prefer to spend most of my time in Firefall doing: climbing.', 'Climbing won\'t make any back-of-the-box features list, and not just because the free-to-play Firefall is only distributed digitally. Here, the action has that unrehearsed, clumsy manner of games where climbing is included but not quite ""designed,"" like in Borderlands with its trash heap jungle gyms, or Skyrim\'s mountainsides that have to be scaled with a sort of zigzag humping motion. Like the former game, Firefall confers a floaty, powerful jump (here bolstered with a jetpack), and like the latter, it offers plenty of alluring heights to test it against. Looming crags, giant coral formations, and neo-futurist superstructures litter the horizon, practically begging to be scaled. Of course, Skyrim and Borderlands nestled Easter eggs in the promontories and nooks of their open worlds, items and secrets that acted as an assenting nod to the player\'s vagabond explorations. By contrast, if you reach the top of a giant mountain in Firefall, or the depths of some strange and glimmering cave, you might find at best a few cast-away assets: a desk, or maybe a crate. As developer nods go, that\'s almost imperceptible.', 'But at such heights, you can get a good view of ""The Melding,"" a towering, weirdly inert cloud wall that fences in the playing populace, and the Arclight, the giant, crashed spaceship that serves as the other grand monument to Firefall\'s stillborn lore. You and the rest of the protagonists are on Earth, ostensibly, though creative license has run roughshod over the topography and filled the beaches and jungles of Brazil with bulbous, otherworldly rock formations and oversized nautilus shells. The planet\'s been ravaged by meteors and aliens in turn, and the last dregs of humanity are staking out a milito-corporate lifestyle in the fringes of the tropical wilds--Borderlands again, by way of Halo.', 'The action has that unrehearsed, clumsy manner of games where climbing is included but not quite ""designed.""', ""From the cel-shaded, intermittently quirky cast of quest-givers and their predilection towards remote communication (even when standing next to you), to the lazy twang of the ambient soundtrack, Gearbox's shooter feels just a bit too present. Even the game's mission-giving job board--one of the basest, most ham-handed conventions to be found in modern video games--makes an appearance, playing its usual role of making saving the world feel like punching in at an assembly line job. Grab a ticket, kill [number] of [bandits/wildlife/aliens], report to [location], click on [object], collect [rewards]."", 'Other than shooting, of course, the particulars of your job are dependent upon your selection of battleframe (mechanical exoskeletons are the new future\'s flying cars), which serves as your traditional MMOG class. I picked the Dreadnaught, the game\'s euphemism for ""tank,"" but the decision really only amounts to a bit of garnish on the shooting drill all classes partake in: line up the enemy in your crosshairs and press the mouse button until the red bar symbolizing its joie de vivre wanes. Each class gets a smattering of more specific hotkey abilities, but I found myself employing those more out of desire to speed things along than to save my hide. Forget a need to group with other players--there simply isn\'t enough risk in the greater part of Firefall to warrant it. Most enemies aren\'t equipped with the smarts to step away from incoming gunfire, let alone process your ability to jetpack to high ground or a few hundred feet away. Even if you manage to die, the only consequence is the long jog back to the battlefield.', ""If you can't entertain yourself by clambering around the environment to line up a nice screenshot, then this remediation of rates becomes the salient feature of Firefall. The game is a cold war against the extra seconds, minutes, and hours that are cast in front of you to turn the eye towards the real-money marketplace. If you want to craft items, you need to pay your tithe in either time or dollars, but the more efficient player sees that mission rewards supersede anything you could create anyway. Even savvier players might eschew the missions entirely, to better focus on the pop-up side-quests that can be turned in a bit quicker, without any of that tedious exposition."", ""While there isn't anything inherently wrong with a free-to-play model, it does stretch what would otherwise be a once-a-month decision to re-up a subscription into a perpetual state of cost-benefit evaluation. It's hard to invest in lore that's so inextricably tied to the grind of missions or side-quests, hard to suspend your awareness of that grind when you're awash in constant pitches for boosters and special unlocks. A purchasable vehicle might mitigate the dreary 1,200m hike between mission markers, but a better game wouldn't have the dreary hike in the first place. I could avoid all that for a time, and maybe do some climbing, but you always have to come down eventually. In Firefall, there isn't much waiting for you when you do.""]"Kevin VanOrd,26-Aug-14,inFamous: Second Son Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/infamous-first-light-review/1900-6415853/,6,PS4,"[""In Infamous: Second Son, leading dudebro Delsin Rowe made little attempt to disguise his newfound powers; in fact, he reveled in them, delighting in the destruction available at his fingertips. Given Delsin's penchant for calling attention to himself by spray-painting street art on public property, such exuberance is unsurprising: he's a self-described rebel wearing a beanie and a denim vest, the kind of anti-establishment cliche born of focus-group testing and savvy marketing. If Delsin were a Simpsons character, he'd be Poochie."", ""I didn't care for Delsin very much."", ""Aside from his appearance as a playable character in its challenge levels, Delsin has no meaningful role to play in Infamous: First Light, which is just as well, since resident dirtbag Shane has masculine bravado to spare. Shane certainly has no qualms subjecting First Light heroine Abigail 'Fetch' Walker to his loathsome pick-up lines and sexist drivel, an uncomfortable and heavy-handed story device designed to make Fetch a sympathetic lead from the get-go, as if her depressing backstory as a runaway were not humanizing enough. Fetch herself fulfills the role the plot expects of her--the street-smart young woman learning how to channel her rage into the superpowers she was once afraid of revealing. It's not the ham-fisted dialogue that makes Fetch so appealing, nor the by-the-numbers story she stars in, but rather actress Laura Bailey's nuanced and emotional performance, as well as Fetch's beautifully animated face."", ""Spending time with Fetch is a delight, which makes it a pity the story missions tie her down with so many limitations. As the plot leads you through its predictable beats, you improve powers and gain access to new ones by completing missions, collecting glowing shards scattered around Seattle, and performing a few mundane side tasks, such as preventing drive-by shootings--which actually just means beating up a few criminals or blowing up their vehicle until all of the hooligans are dead. Fetch's neon-based abilities allow her to speed through the city as a ray of light, enclose enemy agents in stasis bubbles, and create a gravitational singularity that sucks in nearby enemies and then detonates with a burst of light and limbs. And yet a good portion of the story tasks are boring sniper missions that bolt you on rooftops and have you firing neon at the shooting gallery underneath you. What a waste of Fetch's talents."", ""Where Second Son flourished--and where First Light also impresses--is in the fluidity of the interactions. Speeding through Seattle is a breakneck delight, particularly when you rush through one of the countless neon vortexes scattered about and pick up an additional speed boost. Seattle is a playground, and the collectible shards that improve your powers have you scurrying up skyscrapers and floating from rooftops. This is the same vibrant, high-fidelity version of Seattle that made Second Son such a fine showcase of the PlayStation 4's capabilities. There are no frame rate hitches to distract you, and there is little textural pop-in to grab your attention. It is you and the city. Obstacles are easily surmounted, making Seattle's borders the only notable boundary to your freeform exploration."", ""It doesn't take long to exhaust the supply of easy secondary activities, which is just as well: as wonderful as it feels to interact with Infamous: First Light, the game simply goes through the open-world motions. The morality system that makes the series stand apart is missing from action here, so the only guiding principles are your own, not the game's. You occasionally have the option to enchain guards and gangsters that try to flee the scene after you've wreaked havoc, but there is no reason to choose peace over murder: First Light is typically concerned only with its own neon fireworks. Given the way Delsin fully embraced his living power fantasy, it's ironic that his story would allow a (sort of) noble path, when the more conscientious Fetch is allowed no such redemption. First Light also displays the symptoms of retroactive continuity: several specifics of this story deviate from the details described in Second Son."", ""It's not in the open world, but in the challenge rooms, where Fetch is most able to let loose. Again, First Light is going through the motions here: you either fight progressively stronger waves of digital enemies, or you do so while rescuing the innocents they threaten. Zipping from corner to corner, blasting Department of Unified Protection guards and digital demons, is an absolute blast, at least before you earn the game's full complement of neon powers, some of which do not unlock until you finish the story. The freedom of movement, the ease with which you can chain melee attacks together, the responsiveness of the controls: all of these attributes combine into a silky smooth demonstration of otherworldly skill."", ""The time comes, however, when you learn how to exploit your powers and earn ultra-high arena scores. Once you've earned sufficiently potent and plentiful homing missiles, you needn't worry too much about exercising a full range of abilities. Instead, you can simply zip from one neon source to another, filling up on juice and spamming enemies with missiles until you are able to summon your colossal singularity and vaporize your attackers. On every level, I easily earned diamond-level scores, the highest you can receive, using this technique. Several times I allowed myself to die just because I'd gone for 45 minutes and had grown more than bored by the process. Combat is far too easy to abuse, and without tension, the battles have no sting."", ""Nevertheless, Infamous: First Light proves itself a serviceable time waster. Fetch is an engaging character, troubled yet intensely loyal, and though her story arc recalls more video games, film, and anime than I care to count, she still commands your attention. I spent about six hours with her in total, and managed a 100-percent playthrough in the process; if you're just in it for the story, you could probably zap your way through in around two hours. Given Second Son's greatness, I had hoped for something more than a time-waster, but this Infamous has no bite."", '']"Heidi Kemps,25-Aug-14,Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/danganronpa-2-goodbye-despair-review/1900-6415852/,8,PlayStation Vita,"['The ""trapped on a tropical island"" trope is one that\'s been used in storytelling for centuries. Frequently, it represents characters of varying socioeconomic backgrounds working together to survive and find a way to return home--or, barring that, engaging in wacky comic hijinks and making radios out of coconuts. It\'s a scenario that fascinates and uplifts, showing the spirit of cooperation and care for our fellow humans in the face of adversity.', ""Leave it to Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair to twist the scenario in every way imaginable. Instead of being stranded due to disastrous circumstances, the characters in Danganronpa 2 are taken to the sunny, scenic, and strangely abandoned resort of Jabberwock Island as part of a field trip organized by their school, Hope's Peak Academy. All of the students at Hope's Peak are members of what are called the Ultimates: youths of extraordinary talent fostered into the school to cultivate their skills and create hope for future generations--save for protagonist Hajime Hinata, who isn't entirely sure how he wound up in the class. The class of 16 is ostensibly here on the island to learn about the magic of hope and friendship, or at least, that's what the strange rabbit creature claiming to be their teacher says."", ""The trip goes to hell in the blink of an eye, however, as the malevolent mascot Monokuma makes a violent return. He's transformed the former resort into a nigh-unescapable prison: even though the islands have plenty of resources for the students to live comfortably, they will be stuck there forever unless they engage in his own version of Battle Royale. Kill another student and get away with the crime, and you could be the lucky one to survive and escape. As the situation gradually degenerates, will Hajime and the other students live long enough to discover the truth behind Jabberwock Island and Monokuma's disturbing game?"", 'Danganronpa 2, like its predecessor, fuses text exposition with mystery puzzle-solving and action elements. The game is divided into several chapters, and each chapter has three parts. During Daily Life, you spend time interacting with your fellow students and advancing the story. After a certain point, what feeble harmony might exist shatters into Deadly Life, in which you must explore and find clues about a vicious murder. Every chapter wraps up with a Class Trial, where the surviving cast must convene to discover who amongst them is the killer. Choose correctly, and the killer is punished with execution; assume wrongly, and the life of everyone remaining is forfeit. The class trials are the highlight, brilliantly interweaving game mechanics with metaphors for arguments: you ""shoot down"" onscreen text arguments with truth bullets representing evidence, break down characters\' verbal defenses and mental blocks, and dive into the depths of your own logic to uncover truths. As accusations fly, arguments heat up, and more pieces of the mysteries come together, you must guide Hajime through tension and raw emotion to uncover the culprit, as shocking as the truth may prove to be.', ""What fuels Danganronpa 2 is the sheer strength of its narrative. The story's twists and turns keep you riveted, delivering emotional highs and lows with true impact. Characters have distinct, unique quirks--part of their existence as Ultimates--that range from a narcoleptic gamer, to an aggressive bisexual chef, to a yakuza prodigy with short man syndrome. As the situation devolves you see the characters change, grow, and reveal other sides of themselves that give them depth beyond just being single-gimmick personalities. It's very easy to grow attached to the cast, which makes finding one of them dead--or discovering that they have a murderous streak to them--a terrifying and emotionally draining moment. All you can do is hope beyond hope that your favorites might make it through mostly unscathed."", ""The feelings of danger, fear, loss, and justice play well into the theme that's been established for the series since the first game: the duality of hope and despair, and how one begets another. When you participate in the class trials, you must find the truth to save yourself and your peers--but you are also condemning a person to death in the process. There are numerous mysteries about the island and its purpose to be solved, and it's satisfying to uncover answers to these questions, in many cases. One character in particular comes to embody this concept of duality in a very unique and interesting way, and the way their saga plays out over the course of the game is exceptionally memorable. Danganronpa 2 definitely not a happy game, but the underlying messages of hope against overwhelming odds and not giving in to despair is both uplifting and inspiring."", 'This is a great game, and much of the actual gameplay is very similar to the original--which certainly isn\'t a bad thing. The most significant changes are some of the mini-games played during the class trial sections. The new version of Hangman\'s Gambit, where you must collect letters to spell out an answer to a question, takes a more puzzle-game-like form this time around. The problem is that it\'s a pretty awful puzzle game, with confusing collect-and-place mechanics and frequently so much going on at once that you errantly focus on minimizing damage rather than actually solving the puzzle. A new element, the Rebuttal Showdown, has you ""cutting down"" arguments with swipes and button presses, which is an interesting concept. In practice, however, it\'s not particularly enjoyable: the directions you need to ""slash"" to destroy arguments and get the advantage seem random, and it\'s far too easy to cut down an important statement and get penalized.', ""Other issues relate to the game's localization, particularly where text formatting is concerned: In several instances, line breaks were misplaced, leading to text rolling off the screen and requiring me to open up the log to read all of the dialogue. In a game that's overwhelmingly text-driven, this is quite the annoyance. Another problem is in translation consistency: an image or location with text written in English when you first see it might be shown in flashback later with Japanese text instead, which can cause confusion."", ""But given how good the rest of the game is, these quibbles don't drag Danganronpa 2 down from greatness. I was hooked from the get-go, enthralled by every surprise turn taken by the story, stunned by every unexpected character revelation, devastated at every death, and pumping my fist at every small victory against that bastard Monokuma. The game's extra mode, which let me interact with the cast without the constant fear of looming death hovering above them all, cemented my love for the game's characters, and the bonus text story made the universe of the two games feel that much more fleshed out. Danganronpa 2 is a simultaneously terrifying, uplifting, painful, thoughtful, funny, and heartbreaking delight. Anyone who cherishes engaging stories, unique gameplay experiences, and great characterization would do well to invest themselves in this series.""]"Brett Todd,25-Aug-14,The Golf Club Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-golf-club-review/1900-6415844/,6,PC,"['""Nice try."" As a dedicated hacker too stubborn to pack the clubs away once and for all, I hear this a fair bit out on the golf course. Now I\'m going to use it myself for a change, this time to describe The Golf Club, an inspired new golf simulation borne out of clear affection for the grand old game that we all alternatively thank and curse the Scots for inventing. But as much as the developers at HB Studios have their hearts in the right place and their heads wrapped around the ins and outs that make golf an addictive pastime, they falter in key areas like control sensitivity, modes of play, and system optimization. The final product is a lot like one of my approach shots, which always look fantastic right up to the point where the ball somehow winds up buried in a sand trap.', ""The Golf Club is a pure simulation, all about recreating the game itself. This is golf, golf, and golf, in that order., so anyone coming to this game from the Tiger Woods series will be shocked at the absence of frills. There is no PGA support, there are no pro golfers, and there aren't any gimmicks like being able to golf with toddler Tiger Woods or shooting targets on a driving range. You take on rounds in stroke play, match play, or four ball. Matches can be played solo, against other live players, or against ghosts, which allows you to see the past shots of other players (and yourself in previous rounds) and compete against their scores without the delays of waiting for these rivals to hit their balls. Tournaments are also available, as are player-created tours linking multiple tournies and courses."", ""I appreciate the old-fashioned approach here, as it reminds me of a simpler time when golf games were just about getting out on the links to drive for show and putt for dough. But the lack of options eventually becomes a problem. There is no way to develop your golfer, for instance, through playing linked tournies or a pro tour. So forget about climbing the pro rankings, or earning cash and experience points that help with longer drives, more accurate putts, and so forth. Everything here is centered on building your personal ability with the game, which is only quantifiable on the scorecard, not on a character screen loaded with skill points. This cuts out the artificial glitz that sometimes gets in the way in sports games, but the realism comes at a cost, as the game isn't as engaging as it would have been had it offered up a role-playing career option."", ""That same design philosophy is also present in the swing mechanics. The Golf Club offers only one way to play. You swing by mimicking a real stroke using either a mouse or a gamepad. With a mouse, you move back for the backswing and then push forward to swing through the ball. With a gamepad, you pull the right stick back and then shove it forward. There are no other options, such as the usual two- or three-click swing. The game doesn't feature a power meter or even any sort of graphic on the screen to let you know if you're swinging straight and true or if you're wobbly enough to get you up close and personal with some poison ivy. A pop-up appears right after you make contact to tell you how you made out in terms of your approach to the ball and the power of your swing, but it's too late to be of any assistance other than giving you some tips on how to do better next time."", ""The realism comes at a cost, as the game isn't as engaging as it would have been had it offered up a role-playing career option."", ""Limiting players to these rigorous swing mechanics is a great idea in theory. And it would be a great idea in reality, as well, if it had been pulled off properly. Unfortunately, swinging is the most irritating part of the game, due to the lack of precision when moving your club. The mouse controls are particularly clumsy, with a slight hesitation every time you pull back to take a shot. As a result, you never move a club in real time. I made a lot of mistakes because of this lack of fluidity, particularly when putting, as I would frequently either put way too much on a ball and sail well past the cup, or get scared and wind up barely tapping the thing. Gamepad controls are better, with the club moving with the right stick almost in real time. Still, having to go to a gamepad for a PC golf game seems sacrilegious, and using the gamepad comes with an accuracy cost, as it's harder to swing straight with the little analog stick than by rolling the mouse back and forth."", ""Thankfully, control issues are not a constant irritation. Games would be more rewarding if you were able to wield a club in real time with your mouse, or adjust your power easily through more precise control. But you're usually able to get where you need to be by going up or down clubs or by cutting down on distance when needed by modifying shots to hit high lofters. The latter is particularly effective with approach shots under 100 yards from the pin. I shoot super high in real life on approaches with anything shorter than a seven-iron anyhow, so this actually makes the game seem somewhat more authentic to me."", ""In spite of its drawbacks, I still found the detailed and challenging nature of the swing simulation to be satisfying when using the mouse. The game cut me no breaks. I'd get a little offline with my swing and it would always show up as a slice or a hook of varying severity depending on how bad I was. Ball lie dramatically affected shots, and I always had to compensate for odd lies in the rough. I found that I really had to study courses to have a shot at besting them, or at least have a chance at making it back to the clubhouse without throwing my mouse against the wall. Every time I went on automatic and fired away with the suggested clubs and shot direction, I would inevitably wind up in big trouble, often consisting of H2O, which is quite plentiful on many courses."", ""Courses are also one of The Golf Club's biggest strengths. Thanks to the game's superb Course Designer, there are dozens and dozens of top courses available, and many of the homebrewed links are better than the eight official ones that ship with the game. I played a number of top ones, including a spectacularly tough take on Egypt and a deep woods course named after the Yeti. Expect the number of courses to explode after the game's official release, when even more players try their luck at design. The course design program is extremely easy to use, too. You can whip up a generic course based on rural, alpine, desert, and autumn themes, in just a few clicks. There is an option to delve deeper, as well, allowing for detailed customization of greens, hazards, rough, and so forth."", ""Another big plus is the in-game commentary. To go along with the general keep-it-simple philosophy that underpins the entire game, all of the play-by-play and color commentary is provided by a single guy who mostly chats with you like a buddy or caddy. Every line is informal, chatty, and encouraging. In an age where sports games typically beat you down with incessant broadcast booth inanities, it's refreshing to just smack around a golf ball with a guy that you wouldn't mind having a beer with back in the clubhouse."", ""The review build that I played--and was certified as reviewable by the developer--suffers from a string of technical problems that may or may not be fixed prior to launch. Improvements apparently are on the way, but The Golf Club is a serious system hog at present, stuttering even when you lower the settings to make the game more manageable. To add insult to injury, the game isn't so good looking that the performance issues seem reasonable. Golfer models are a little blurry, the generic background scenery lacks the picture-postcard vistas seen in other golf games, there are no frills like crowds along the fairways, and the camera occasionally winds up directly behind a tree or in some weeds. You get hot-air balloons floating on some courses by as a tribute to Links, but overall, the game looks dated. Nevertheless, I expect the visual impact of the game to improve as users begin crafting more courses with the editor: some player-designed courses look more impressive than the official ones."", ""The Golf Club falls short of the green in its current state. There is a tremendous amount of potential here, and the game is immensely satisfying at times due to the demanding nature of the simulation and the wide variety of courses available to play. Off-kilter swing mechanics and noteworthy performance problems have to be addressed, but this is a game to watch. Many key fundamentals are already in place, and The Golf Club's creative community is likely to keep the game alive for years to come.""]"Jeremy Signor,21-Aug-14,Might & Magic: Duel of Champions Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/might-and-magic-duel-of-champions-forgotten-wars-r/1900-6415849/,7,Xbox 360,"[""Video card games currently enjoy a significant niche in the gaming landscape thanks to Blizzard's Hearthstone, Stoneblade's SolForge, and even paper stalwart Magic: The Gathering's abundant online options. The once-physical phenomenon that is the collectable card game is now being leveraged in the digital space thanks to the genre's easily-exploitable business models. That means more options and enjoyable experiences for card game fans, but also more iterations of what came before. Might and Magic Duel of Champions: Forgotten Wars stands in the middle of these two possibilities, offering a derivative experience that is at the same time fun and rewarding in its own right."", ""You don't have to look too closely to see what other familiar mechanics Forgotten Wars is stitched together from. Each deck requires a hero card be included--the mechanic Hearthstone is built upon--which determines your starting health, base attributes, and other abilities, some of which are unique to that hero. The resource statistic you expend to play cards is also reminiscent of Hearthstone: you receive a set amount of resources each turn, starting at one and progressively increasing by increments of one during each supply phase. Hearthstone caps this progression at 10, but Forgotten Wars expands the limit even further. Still, the idea is the same: you start each game playing less powerful cards and gradually play more powerful ones later in the game."", ""Positioning also plays an important role. You can play creatures, spells, and buildings in one of eight slots on the board, which form lines and rows that game effects can target. If a creature is unimpeded by an opposing one in front of it, it can attack the opponent's hero directly. Otherwise, you'll damage the creature standing in its way, though you also have the option of moving your creature to an empty space instead of attacking. This system is much like SolForge's, though Duels offers eight potential slots to SolForge's four, which greatly increases both the possible interactions and the complexity of play."", ""You may have noticed the not-so-subtle trend at this point: Duels of Champions aims to take proven mechanics from high-quality competitors, mix them together, and turn the volume up to 11, making for a bigger, badder end product. Since there is no ceiling to the amount of resources you can produce, you can create game states that completely turn the tables on opponents later in the game. The expanded positioning system gives the game a greater tactical crunch and multiple visual dimensions, allowing you to fight the enemy on multiple fronts. Grouping creatures into three different types that determine where you can deploy them--melees in the front, shooters in the back, and flyers anywhere--reinforces the emphasis on greater complexity and puts an original stamp on Duels's contributions to the genre."", ""The idea of Duel of Champions is simple enough: you build decks of cards that act as creatures, damage spells, and other effects with the sole purpose of reducing opponents' life totals to zero using these cards in concert."", ""While pumping familiar mechanics full of steroids is a surefire way to wring as much out of them as possible, that doesn't mean the experience you create in doing so is vastly different. The main crux is about poking holes in your opponent's defenses, which is exactly what you already must do in SolForge, albeit in a much more streamlined package. The same can be said for its handling of the hero mechanic so reminiscent of Hearthstone. And in some cases, the game's bigger is better mantra works counter to itself. The infinitely increasing resource counter does allow for some big late-game moves, but unless you've established a killer card-drawing engine, you'll have very few ways to spend those resources. The limited board positions also hamstring late-game shenanigans: if your board is full, you can't cast any more creatures, and you must sit on your hand until a space frees up."", ""Duels also suffers from balance issues inherent to the few quirks it claims ownership to. Each hero starts with three stats that determine which cards you're able to cast. Each turn, you may increase one of them by one; the problem is that the different types of cards each run primarily on one stat--creatures require might, spells use magic, and fortune cards need destiny--so you're forced down one route during the beginning of the game, usually the might path, so that you can start casting creatures. If you find yourself needing to kill an opposing creature, you have to wait until you increase your magic points across multiple turns. This dynamic means that the opening five or six turns of the game is an arms race in which both players play creature after creature, and the first player whose defenses fall is suddenly at a huge disadvantage. Because of this, bigger creatures take over fairly easily, forcing the opponent to spend multiple cards to deal with it. Removal spells are also pretty hard to play, with hefty magic requirements and symmetrical effects that can hurt your own creatures. As a result, creature battles bloom only in the later rounds of the game, which is unfortunate."", ""Still, Duels does make an impressive enough bid for a CCG player's attention, so it's a good thing its online play works well. Multiplayer is lacking in options--you can only play the base game--but interactions are smooth and the interface accommodates fluid play. Ending your turn requires you to hold a button for half a second, so accidental passes are rare. You also needn't worry about rushing unless you take an extraordinarily long time taking your turn, a good move for a game with so much going on at once."", ""The game rewards extended play as well. Not only does your ranking go up the more you win, but you also get free spins of the randomized card slot machine, which lets you buy additional cards from the base set using gold you earn from playing. You can also spend real-world money to add cards from any of four expansion sets to the reel (which you then need to spend gold on to get the actual cards), though to the game's credit, you never need expansion cards to have an effective deck. Daily quests that are basically repeatable achievements further entice you to keep playing."", ""Duel of Champions revels in the current video CCG boom, offering a light remix of some of the genre's best and most successful games contained within a pumped-up package. Duel of Champions is a quality mixtape of current trends, offering a fun, complex option for competitive card game enthusiasts. The problem is that, in this moment in time, we're spoiled for options in a genre where replayability is key. It would be a shame if Duel of Champions' lack of innovation caused it to slip through the cracks, because though it's stuck in the familiar, its commitment to making card games feel more epic is both fun and commendable.""]"Britton Peele,21-Aug-14,Shadowgate Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/shadowgate-review/1900-6415848/,7,PC,"['If you\'ve been playing games for a long while, the Shadowgate name is probably familiar to you. Since it helped spark the adventure game genre back in the 80s, Shadowgate has been ported to a variety of systems, most famously the NES. You used a lot of the same commands as in a text adventure like Zork--""go"" here, ""take"" that, ""eat""--but a graphical representation of each room helped you navigate and solve puzzles. This new Shadowgate, a reimagining of the original, operates in more or less the same way. But while it\'s the same quest in spirit, much has been changed, added, and improved in order to make this a throwback adventure worth exploring whether you have nostalgia for it or not--provided you\'re ready to do a lot of pointing and clicking.', 'Shadowgate drops you in front of a locked door with nothing but a dagger, a torch, and your wits. An optional tutorial walks you through the first few simple puzzles, but for the most part, you are on your own. The perspective is first-person, and all exploring is done by moving between mostly-static (though wonderfully illustrated) images, or rooms. Each room has its own objects of interest, which you interact with via a variety of verbs like ""hit,"" ""look"" or ""open."" Time only moves with each of your actions, leaving you free to stop and stare at the scenery as much as you\'d like. You must keep a close eye on your torch and replace it if the light starts to go out, but Shadowgate is a largely slow-paced affair.', ""If you get stuck trying to figure out a specific mechanism or wondering what item might be useful in a situation, you can get a hint from your sole traveling companion, a skull named Yorick. This is good, because there's so much to look at and interact with that it can be overwhelming. Yes, you can use your torch to burn a rug and find two gold coins underneath it. Will you need them? No. On one hand, such unnecessary interactions are great, as they give you a better sense of freedom than many point-and-click adventures, which usually limit your interactions to a few key objects. On the other hand, it means your inventory can get cluttered, which is a pain if you prefer to brute force your way through puzzles by using every object on every other object, just in case."", 'If you find yourself using certain items or commands more than others, you can bind them to the number keys on your keyboard. This is one of several ways the developers have streamlined the experience; thanks to another tweak, a double click will usually look at an item or move in a direction, depending on what\'s clicked. (This doesn\'t always work, though. Don\'t hesitate to try the ""go"" command if you think you should be able to move somewhere.) Nevertheless, there is still tedium to struggle with. There is no overall quick-travel system, for instance (aside from a few shortcuts), so if you need to go from one side of the world to the other, you must make the long walk screen by screen, click by click. There is also some degree of pixel hunting, as it can be easy to overlook an item that you might need in the future.', ""Time only moves with each of your actions, leaving you free to stop and stare at the scenery as much as you'd like."", ""Unfortunately, Shadowgate also still suffers from the age-old problem that plagues most adventure games: puzzle solutions typically need to be very specific, and they aren't always intuitive. To be fair, this game is far better than its predecessor on that front, as most puzzles make logical sense and can be solved with wits alone. And even if you're wrong but on the right track, the game will try to nudge you in the right direction; for instance, if you try to use a dagger, the game might advise you to try something bigger (like a sword). For the most part, carefully reading clues and carefully thinking about the tools are your disposal will get you where you need to go."", ""But spending hours trying to decipher riddles doesn't make for the most welcoming experience, especially if you lack experience with the original game. Fortunately, Shadowgate does some interesting things with its difficulty settings. You can choose between three difficulties at the start of the game, and they make the quest easier or harder by actually adding or removing content from the game itself. For example, one of the very first things you see at the start of the game is a doorway with skulls forming an arch on top of it. On the game's easiest difficulty setting, this arch is missing one skull, which you have to find and place within the arch later in order to progress. On harder settings, it's missing three. Easier difficulties remove certain items, puzzles, and even entire areas."", ""Removing content might sound counterintuitive--why choose a gameplay setting with which you don't actually get to see the entire game?--but the effect is huge. By eliminating so many steps from the journey, Shadowgate becomes a lot more approachable if you prefer a more laid back journey. There is less chance of feeling lost, less chance of feeling paralyzed by confusion. Not only do these varied difficulty levels make this an appealing adventure to all types of players, but by adding diversity to individual puzzles, they invite you to make the trek a second or third time. The only catch is that some objects and options no longer serve a purpose on lower difficulties, which can be distracting. Players on earlier difficulties will find locked doors that can never be opened, and the game's hint system will occasionally give you information for puzzles that you never encounter, making them not just irrelevant but also misleading."", 'Death can come quickly in Shadowgate. Using the wrong item at the wrong time, being unprepared for a room, or even simply taking too many turns to explore may prove deadly. Saving often is key to avoiding frustration, though the game\'s automatic saves might rescue you as well (something they\'re more likely to do on easier difficulty settings). There are so many ways to die, in fact, that the developers have in a sense created an entire metagame around finding Shadowgate\'s special ""hidden deaths,"" which are ways to die that are slightly more outside the box.', 'For the most part, carefully reading clues and carefully thinking about the tools are your disposal will get you where you need to go.', ""One death condition has the potential to be more annoying than the others, if you succumb to it. Relatively early on in the game, an enemy poisons you, an event that you cannot avoid. The game hints that you should take care of this sickness, but isn't specific about how long you have. Every turn you take after that point, a timer counts down to your death. Should you waste too much time trying to solve the mysteries of the castle, you could end up locking yourself into a no-win scenario."", ""Adventure games have enjoyed a resurgence in recent years, but Shadowgate represents a different and currently rare kind of experience. It's unashamed of its roots, sometimes to a fault, but as an attempt to recreate a classic it succeeds far more than it falters. It doesn't do anything that would make the Shadowgate name as revolutionary as it once was, but it's an enjoyable adventure for old admirers and newcomers alike."", '', '']"Josiah Renaudin,20-Aug-14,CounterSpy Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/counterspy-review/1900-6415850/,8,PS4 & PlayStation Vita & PS3,"[""CounterSpy is a slick operation. The stop-and-go nature of your average stealth game often makes it difficult to strike a balance between proper pacing and mechanical consistency, as dodging vision cones and memorizing patrol patterns forces the flow of combat to pop and sputter. However, CounterSpy's responsive espionage action and polished movement keep the tempo moving at a steady clip. Precise gunplay and close-quarters combat gives you tactical freedom when clearing out rooms of grunts, and rich customization options present new ways to play each of the procedurally generated missions. A few nagging AI inconsistencies and the stunted runtime are disappointing, but CounterSpy's superb presentation and satisfying executions make for a sterling package that deserves the spotlight."", ""It's CounterSpy's simplicity that makes it so instantly appealing. Instead of encumbering you with complex systems, the side-scrolling missions have you simply jumping and shooting your way through a series of safeguarded rooms in order to grab critical intel. Natural cover provides a bounty of openings to slow down and pick your shots, but quickly raising your weapon and popping off a few rounds once you elevate suspicion can be just as efficient. You're encouraged to silently snap necks and deliver hot lead between your opposition's eyes, but your crafty spy has enough dexterity and raw firepower to deal with the repercussions of being spotted."", ""It's easy to pick up and play, but that doesn't mean that the game lacks depth. Peeking over cover alters your perspective, transforming CounterSpy into more of a third-person, gallery-style shooter than a 2D side-scroller. Leaning against walls emphasizes that effect by letting you fire at enemies in the distance, deepening the environments. This perspective shift occasionally breaks a few key mechanics; I often awkwardly wrapped my arms around guards who were standing in the background, for instance. What did and didn't grab someone's attention also seemed to shift from one cover spot to the next, but effortlessly emptying rounds into enemies on multiple planes without alerting a single soul is genuinely satisfying."", ""The most obvious armament to have at the ready is your silenced pistol, but if things get hairy, you have options. Collecting schematics unlocks new weapons to take into the field, giving you the ability to go loud with a shotgun if the numbers begin to stack against you. Modifiers, on the other hand, offer competitive advantages like greater endurance and silent steps even as you dash across the screen. Of course, everything costs a bit of in-game cash, and since purchased modifiers disappear after completing a level, you have to cleverly budget your resources in order to tackle the more difficult missions with the most effective loadouts. But as long as you play smart and explore the supplementary screens of a given location, you won't be short on money."", ""Getting spotted won't result in mission failure, but there are consequences if you don't practice restraint in combat. CounterSpy takes place in an alternate Cold War setting, meaning there's an ever-present threat of a nuclear attack--in this case, on the moon--hanging over your head. It's a constant race against a doomsday clock, and being seen on security cameras or letting a soldier alert a superior of your presence over radio will expedite the launch. As an agent of the impartial C.O.U.N.T.E.R organization, it's your job to keep both The Imperialist States and The Socialist Republic at bay by monitoring the separate alert states for each fictional nation."", ""The '60s setting is best represented through its smooth jazz jingles and cel-shaded aesthetics, which are sharp on both the PlayStation Vita and home consoles. Period-appropriate uniforms and propaganda create a strong sense of place, while the reactive shadows and deep reds and blues produce a consistently soothing tableau. CounterSpy never breaks character, and while you're often scoring headshots and snapping necks, the game still finds time to add a healthy dose of dry humor into the sparse dialogue."", ""CounterSpy is just a cool cat, but regrettably, it's over before you've had enough. No two levels are the same, so you can keep rolling the dice before reaching the game's conclusion in order to discover fresh level geometry. However, it took me about two hours to reach the credits, and I still wanted to see more. You can spend additional time finding weapon schematics or boosting your high score on the global leaderboard, but I wish there were better reasons to continue playing with the game's refined systems."", 'It might be short, but I enjoyed almost every minute of my time with CounterSpy. The movement and gunplay are smooth and responsive, and the lovingly crafted presentation remains stunning throughout. This is a stealth game that makes you feel as silent as you are deadly, and is wonderfully, wholly refreshing.']"Daniel Hindes,19-Aug-14,Surgeon Simulator 2013 Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/surgeon-simulator-anniversary-edition-review/1900-6415847/,4,PS4,"['Playing Surgeon Simulator Anniversary Edition is akin to participating in a joke where you are the punch line. It\'s a game that is deliberately designed to feel unwieldy as you perform operations that require dexterity and finesse. Neither are to be found here; instead, you move your hand around the operating table and manipulate individual fingers to grab instruments and pray you don\'t accidentally drop them in the patient\'s exposed chest cavity. This is as much a ""simulator"" as Mario Kart is a driving test.', 'Surgeon Simulator has been available on PC and tablets for over a year now, and each version has seen gradual content additions since its first release. On the PlayStation 4, the Anniversary Edition packages everything into a single download. The full range of surgeries is ready and waiting--heart transplants, kidney transplants, brain surgery, eye surgery, and teeth pulling. Each of these operations can be performed in different environments: an operating theatre, on a wheelie bed while running down a corridor, in the back of a bumpy ambulance, and in zero gravity. Just like the surgical instruments, bones and organs conform to a rudimentary physics system, and the different environments function as difficulty modifiers.', ""It boggles the mind to understand how one could possibly perform these operations in zero-G given how fiendishly difficult their terrestrial versions are themselves. This is all part of the joke: you're expected to fail spectacularly and kill your patient multiple times. What ensues is a unique approach to interactive slapstick comedy that sees you attempting to open a ribcage but instead accidentally dropping a live buzz saw among the patient's exposed internal organs."", 'In motion control mode, you rotate the arm and tilt the wrist by waving the gamepad in a similar fashion.', ""The thing is, this joke is far funnier on PC than it is on PS4 because of the way the gamepad controls the surgeon's hand. With a mouse and keyboard, you have a far greater degree of accuracy and finesse available to you that, with practice, feels like it can be used constructively. Each individual finger of the surgeon's hand can be opened or closed with a separate key on the keyboard. Positioning the hand with the mouse allows for more precise, minute movements, which are necessary to complete the surgeries."", ""On the PS4, the gamepad tells a different story. In motion control mode, you rotate the arm and tilt the wrist by waving the gamepad in a similar fashion. The interesting thing is that this actually feels more intuitive than the same motions on the mouse do. With the mouse, it feels like you are controlling a piece of machinery, making individual adjustments to the wrist's angle, the elevation of the hand, and the rotation of the arm, whilst stopping in between each step. That is where the PC's accuracy comes from. With the gamepad, you are making all of these motions at once. It feels far more fluid, but it's also impossible to achieve the same level of accuracy as in the PC version."", ""Compounding this is the analogue nature in which the gamepad's triggers are used. You do not have fine control over the surgeon's fingers; instead, the harder you press the right trigger, the more fingers that close in a gripping motion. It's just plain frustrating attempting to be accurate this way. The elevation of the arm is also controlled in a similarly analogue fashion with the left trigger, and it too suffers from imprecision. An alternative control method which involves using the right thumbstick to replace the motion control components is less intuitive than the motion control itself, and still suffers from a lack of accuracy due to the analogue nature of the stick."", ""But here's the thing: lack of accuracy in the controls is the whole point of Surgeon Simulator. That is the joke. However, when it comes to the difference between fun and frustrating, it's a matter of degrees. Playing Surgeon Simulator on PS4 is like listening to someone stumble through the telling of what could have been a hilarious wisecrack. The addition of achievements, some cheeky unlockable secrets, and a slight graphical upgrade over its original PC release doesn't make it funnier.""]"Josiah Renaudin,19-Aug-14,Akiba's Trip: Undead & Undressed Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/akibas-trip-undead-and-undressed-review/1900-6415846/,4,PlayStation Vita,"[""The fact that a game called Akiba's Trip: Undead & Undressed isnt completely tasteless might be its greatest accomplishment. This is a beat 'em up in which the ultimate goal is to strip all enemies of their clothing--a premise that proves a difficult hurdle to leap. The camera draws attention to the skimpy underwear and bouncy breasts of your bloodthirsty foes as you methodically expose their bodies, but--believe it or not--it goes beyond simple eye candy. The goofy story does its best to justify the sheer volume of bare skin, and the equal spread of male and female characters means you'll see just as many lacy undergarments as you do tighty whities. Unfortunately, Akiba's Trip just isn't any fun to play, and that makes the incessant panty shots and uninspired humor even more difficult to stomach."", ""Bear with me as I explain the convoluted narrative. You enter Akihabara, Tokyo's electronics district, during an outbreak of vampiric foes called Synthisters. These powerful enemies were once human, but now roam the streets hoping to suck the life energy from the city's unsuspecting residents. Your customizable protagonist, along with a medley of colorful freedom fighters, commit themselves to cleaning up their home the only way they know how--by stripping the opposition down to their undergarments. Like actual vampires, Synthisters are sensitive to the sunlight, so revealing their skin causes them to burn and return to human form."", ""The yarn unravels to expose seedy corporate involvement and a series of unlikely villains, but it isn't enough to mask the disquieting nature of Akiba's Trip. You spend the bulk of your time ripping off as much clothing as possible to expose nearly naked anime bodies to the world, which is intended to be the real draw here. Stripping bosses will often lead to more detailed views of their often unrealistic, hand-drawn figures, so if it's scantily-clad anime bodies you're looking for, you'll find them here in spades. The unremitting innuendos within the dialogue only weaken the already thin narrative justifications for the partial nudity, and while the focus on bare skin isn't the only attraction, I still felt uncomfortable with what was being asked of me."", ""You can party up with both male and female freedom fighters when patrolling the streets, but most of your time will be spent impressing your buxom allies. How you choose to respond during conversations determines whose affection you garner, and there's even a set cast member who can provide updates on which woman in your life has become the most smitten with you. It's a mostly shallow mechanic that leads to extraneous exchanges during otherwise heated scenarios. Talk of how you're going to save your city or discover the source of the Synthister menace is often followed by awkward complimentary phrases aimed at your busty childhood friend."", ""Even if you manage to overcome the fact that Akiba's Trip: Undead & Undressed is about stripping enemies down to their skivvies, you won't be rewarded with much more than a mindless brawler."", ""The carnal themes and prosaic dialogue would be a bit more palpable if the game played well, but repetitive combat and a painfully inconsistent framerate muddy the action. In battle, you're often surrounded by five or more enemies at once, swinging a weapon at each foe's head, body, and legs in order to score a knockout. A combination of high, mid, and low attacks damage the different pieces of clothing to their breaking point, making it easier to strip them right off of someone's body."", ""You can combo these strips together if multiple articles of clothing are weak enough to remove, but this strategy isn't enough to spice up an otherwise tedious process. Breaking down the pants, shirts, and hats of a swarm of foes as you protect the durability of your own wardrobe is a chore, and your ability to restore your clothes to full strength during battle by holding down a single button removes any semblance of tension. The systems aren't broken, and less populated arenas tend to produce smoother, more enjoyable action, but I had less and less fun with the mechanics as additional enemies flooded the screen."", ""The combat's lone saving grace comes in the form of upgradeable weapons, each of which has its own set of unique combinations. Heavier objects like arcade monitors deal serious damage, but your character lumbers with each swing. Boxing gloves, on the other hand, allow for more nimble striking--though you'll often focus on a single enemy at a time instead of the full group. It's enjoyable to find, buy, and upgrade different objects with varying attributes, and the same can be said for your clothing. Whether you prefer to go into battle sporting a three-piece suit or nothing more than a tattered pair of brown slacks, youve got options."", ' ', ""There's little to do outside of the nonsensical story and lackluster battles. The main quests often take you from the home base to a different segment of Akihabara that's been invaded by Synthisters, while the side missions drag you through dull fetch quests and additional combat scenarios to earn extra spending money. There's a New Game Plus feature that opens up fresh character customization options, but I had more than my fill of Akiba's Trip well before the storys resolution."", ""Even if you manage to overcome the fact that Akiba's Trip: Undead & Undressed is about stripping enemies down to their skivvies, you won't be rewarded with much more than a mindless brawler. The monotonous combat only grows more tiresome as you progress, and it's almost too easy to predict the twists and turns of the formulaic plot. Akiba's Trip has a bizarre concept that might turn a few heads, but once you strip away the promiscuity, there's little left to keep your attention.""]"Kevin VanOrd,19-Aug-14,Metro Redux Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metro-redux-review/1900-6415843/,8,PC & Xbox One & PS4,"[""Some games are about people--their struggles, their hopes, their dreams, their powers. Other games are about systems and logic. Blocks fall from above and you maneuver them into place, you twist dials into the correct pattern, or you collect enough currency until you can afford a stronger helmet or a sharper sword. Then there are the games about place. The Chronicles of Riddick, for instance, is less about Richard Riddick and his throaty threats than it is about Butcher Bay, a stifling prison that serves as a parched planet's only bastion of intelligent life. Assassin's Creed features plentiful characters--heroes, lovers, and betrayers among them--but the cities of Damascus and Jerusalem, their temples and mosques, the way the golden spires reflect the sun, are the centerpieces of the historical journey."", ""And so it is with Metro Redux, a collection of two melancholy games, each of them crushed by the weight of a ruined Earth with little hope to tender. Both adventures allow you time to choke on their dusty, irradiated air, time in which you simply are, time that makes you wonder how the survivors of humankind's nuclear error find the will to carry on. In both Metro: Last Light and in the refashioned Metro 2033, there is more dread in the deafening silence than there is in the retort of a shotgun. In the metro tunnels beneath Moscow, you scavenge for ammo to use as currency as well as munitions, burn away cobwebs with your lighter, and search for gas masks that allow you to breathe the perilous air should you approach the surface. There are pockets of humanity within these depths, and while they provide you some companionship and even an occasional shimmer of joy, even outposts prove perilous. You might weather the factional turbulence that pits brother against brother, but the emotional fog of desperation still proves noxious."", ""It's possible you may have filled the role of series hero Artyom and trudged through this thick misery before. Returning to such a dismal place may not sound too appealing, but there's something to be learned about the resilience of humankind down there, where mutants and other grotesqueries lurk. Metro 2033 most benefits from this new iteration, practically feeling like a new game given the newly structured storytelling and a visual upgrade that raises it close to the bar Metro: Last Light later set. Given the recency of Last Light, your memories of 2033 may be colored by the more recent game, which featured far better lighting and a more sensible user interface, but a side-by-side comparison of the original and the remastered 2033 is striking."", ""Consider, for instance, the first moment you emerge into the Russian winter. The original game suggested the frigidity in part by way of crystalline fractals upon your gas mask; in the Redux version, a full snow is underway, and the sense is less of a brisk chill than it is of a piercing bite. When a massive door opens and an explorer returns from his excursion, you now see the passage behind him rather than a murky suggestion of it. Character models are brand-new, replacing the dead-eyed originals with faces and bodies that look somewhat more natural, if still a bit stiff. In some cases, I prefer the original vision to its replacement; I still find vanilla 2033's nosalises more terrifying than their newer models, and hunters that once donned alien-looking gas masks with night-vision goggles attached sometimes wear more mundane masks now. But once was a high-contrast haze now looks more natural, objects casting proper shadows and beams of light no longer washing away the finer details."", 'You might weather the factional turbulence that pits brother against brother, but the emotional fog of desperation still proves noxious.', ""You'd be harder pressed to find sweeping visual changes in Redux's version of Metro: Last Light; it is the standard to which 2033 has been raised. The more meaningful difference here is the ability to apply 2033's more stringent supplies of gas masks and ammunition, thus addressing a shift in difficulty that the original's most strident fans bemoaned. Conversely, should you prefer Last Light's original balancing, you can apply it to 2033. In either case, choosing similar levels of challenge between the two games helps smooth their differences, making playing both games in succession a heartrending and rewarding experience that feels less like playing a game and its sequel, and more like playing a single game that has been split into two units."", ""The differences between Last Light's and 2033's innate levels of difficulty aren't so vast that they evoke different emotions. Instead, the difference is in degrees--degrees of tension, degrees of fright. However you choose to play, the tunnels and the surface above are both fraught with dangers, dangers that feel all the more harrowing when you confront them after long stretches of only seeing signs of them and being warned of their presence. In both games, I remember the first time a winged demon soared in from above, grabbed me with its fearsome talons, and dropped me to the ground. It was terrifying, this sudden loss of control, the sight of the scorched earth beneath me, the demon drilling its screeches into my skull. I knew these moments were coming but I was still left breathless each time. And when the creature dropped me into the poisonous water below, I grimaced as I caught a glimpse of another victim's visage before succumbing to death."", 'However you choose to play, the tunnels and the surface above are both fraught with dangers, dangers that feel all the more harrowing when you confront them after long stretches of only seeing signs of them and being warned of their presence.', ""Clearly, Metro Redux owes as much of a debt to survival horror games as it does to shooters, no surprise given how so many members of its development team lent their talents to the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series. You spend as much time if not more soaking in the darkness as you do firing a weapon, and even when violence is imminent, you can approach many situations as a stealthy hunter. Metro: Last Light's levels are more carefully structured than 2033's, giving AI-controlled Nazis and Communists room to spread out and flank, whereas a few too many of Metro 2033's levels squeeze the action into chokepoints that can give the game a smidgen of a shooting gallery feel. I enjoy the silent lurking, sneaking from one light source to another to plunge the area into darkness and then knifing soldiers one by one. When guns begin to blaze, it is the Valve rifle with reflex sight that I am most drawn to when at medium range, thanks to its powerful blast and the way headshots land with such drama. Up close, each shotgun proves a vital tool of brutality. The weapons and enhancements introduced in Metro: Last Light are available in Redux's version of 2033, again making this package feel like a single cohesive experience."", ""Whether or not the AI is aware of your presence, it doesn't go out of its way to prove itself resourceful. Once on alert, enemies are aware of potential danger but not of each other, allowing you to pick one off after another as they turn the same corner, or simply bump into each other and walk in place should their respective destinations force them cross paths. Off the battlefield, your fellow humans prove somewhat more capable as conversationalists; they're weary and sometimes wise. I cannot speak to the authenticity of the Russian accents, but I am struck by how so many characters find ways to laugh and sneer at destiny. You are often joined by others, on the battlefield and off, each of them speaking with both regret and a kind of morbid cheer, as if they had just recently drowned their sorrows in a liter of vodka."", ""Other attempts to bring humanity to the shadows are ultimately more laughable than they are compelling. In Metro 2033, you encounter a little boy who, like so many children in video games, neither looks nor sounds like a boy but instead like a miniature adult doing his best impersonation of a kindergartner. The following sequence, in which your movement is hindered because you must carry the child, would have been tense were it not for the the unrealistic way your ward speaks, acts, and moves. Metro: Last Light, in the meanwhile, raises its supernatural stakes during the final third with a gameplay hook that isn't to everyone's taste. I am still moved by the events that follow, and by the way Artyom acts as a conduit between forces that don't understand each other. Yet I can't help but recognize that many of the game's most poignant moments come by way of the metro's residents and their stubborn refusal to succumb to travesty. The later moments feel more forced and manipulative, less about the needs of those that suffer and more about the needs of the writers to lead the game to its natural and heavily foreshadowed conclusion."", ""Then again, Metro Redux isn't really about any one of these people--not Artyom, not any so-called Dark One, not Bourbon, and certainly not any of the game's few women, most of whom exist as entertainment for men, whether as can-can dancers or as naked silhouettes. No, this compilation is about a place. It's a place where you can hear the laughter of children long since dead, and the screams of aircraft passengers moments before their incineration. It's a place where you must fear both the hideous mutants that prowl as well as humankind--and yet it's only with humankind that you might find safety. It's that ebb and flow, that movement in and out of danger, and the panic you feel when danger finds you even when you think you should be most at peace, that makes Metro Redux such an excellent tour through the best and worst of a society in ruins.""]"Kevin VanOrd,18-Aug-14,MIND: Path to Thalamus Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mind-path-to-thalamus-review/1900-6415845/,7,PC,"[""Mind: Path to Thalamus is easy to classify but difficult to parse, a first-person puzzle game that's not about the puzzles but instead about what they stand for. Like many other games that appear on Steam and float in and out of the collective consciousness, this is a metaphysical journey that prioritizes discovery over solution, and it's a largely successful one, leading you through one gorgeous environment after another so that you might ogle the view and wonder about its meaning within Path to Thalamus' larger narrative. And it's that narrative that provides both the game's fall from grace and its ultimate salvation."", ""Mind: Path to Thalamus owes a debt at least in part to Myst and its sequels, games that twisted your brain into knots when you weren't admiring the surrounding beauty and pondering the mysteries you were unveiling. Here, you wander through various surreal locales--meadows crisscrossed by stone walkways and dotted with pillars, floating islands connected by glowing portals, and beaches topped with sunny blue skies. Making your way through this world means carrying wire-mesh orbs and dropping them in designated regions in order to affect the weather, turn day to night, or make walkways corporeal. Discovering how you influence the world around you is intrinsic to the experience. Not only do you discover on your own how to make it rain, but you also discover what that rain means for the world around you, and what it means for escaping your comely mental prison."", ""That weather motif is one of several ways Path to Thalamus ties its puzzle-solving to its story. You assume the role of a comatose storm-chaser, grappling with his guilt while stuck inside his own head, facing the loss of two loved ones with a single name. The losses were the result of his weather obsession, the specifics of which are only hinted at as the man narrates your journey through his brain. This is a heavy-handed story; it takes itself so incredibly seriously in the way it slathers on the pedantic metaphors, and in the narrator's own wistful recollections, some of which are difficult to listen to. This is due in part to the voice acting, which doesn't communicate the solemnity the writing calls for, and in part to the lead's self-pity, which made me wish the narrative canvas had been painted upon by a subtler brush."", ""Nevertheless, the final level may not have worked so well had the previous few hours not been so insufferably earnest. I'd rather not reveal how the narrator's contrition is so dramatically subverted, except to say that Path to Thalamus forces its protagonist to stare at his own troubled reflection. The subversion is itself undermined by the script's continuing insistence on sticking with the most hackneyed lessons possible, but I appreciated the game's willingness to skew its own vanity, along with the inherent selfishness and haughty righteousness of the guilt complex."", 'Fortunately, Path to Thalamus\' puzzles and settings stand apart on their own, provided you\'re prepared for the slow pace inherent to meandering through its spaces. There is no run button, and you have to tinker a bit to uncover each level\'s exit, so expect to explore and test the game\'s limits, bumping against the (sometimes invisible) walls that enclose the map and stumbling through the occasional murk. Most of the puzzles aren\'t demanding, and performing them often requires more effort than actually devising the solution to them. Even so, some of them reveal a cleverness of design that\'s impossible not to admire. I had a number of ""Eureka!"" moments when I discovered how rolling an orb down a particular hill could power a series of rising platforms and lift an opaque fog, timing such events in a way that eased my passage to a new area. The most impressive moments, however, come in the later chapters, when you must face a haunting colossus and purposefully brush against death so that you may continue to live.', ""A few annoyances interfered with my adventure; I got stuck in place twice when trying to make leaps I hoped might have clever results, and finding an orb in the grass when night has fallen can be a frustration. These are small irritations, but in a game this focused, such irritations can linger. Fortunately, the delights linger as well--the stunning landscapes, the grand sense of scale that pervades a few of the later levels, the artful manner in which the final scenario reimagines the archetypical video game boss. Even if you don't fall in love with Path to Thalamus, I suspect you won't be fully immune to its gravity.""]"Miguel Concepcion,15-Aug-14,Diablo III Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/diablo-3-ultimate-evil-edition-review/1900-6415842/,9,Xbox One & PS4,"['When it comes to Diablo, one should expect a sense of finality when an upgraded version features the word ""Ultimate"". After all, where do you go after defeating The Devil? Developer Blizzard\'s answer--in the Reaper of Souls expansion--was a villain that was the closest thing to Death. Unless the studio can come up with an expansion to vanquish a tax collector, it\'s safe to say that Diablo III: Ultimate Evil Edition is as final as it gets. Thanks to two years worth of PC version fixes, wise console-friendly UI adjustments, and a number of exclusive social features, this also happens to be the definitive version of Diablo III.', ""Diablo III's bleakness is so comprehensive, one can't help but admire Blizzard's dedication. If you're not engaging in conversation with downtrodden and pessimistic townsfolk, you're fending off a seemingly limitless stream of demons. It feels all the more poignant when you walk on floors fully covered in corpses in Reaper of Souls. Given that the apocalyptic tone and art direction is so pervasive and focused, it's remarkable that the darkness doesn't feel overbearing or monotonous."", ""The feeling of item ownership in Diablo III is an awfully fickle one, much thanks to the game's swift pacing. When new loot appears so often and in such great numbers, your ensemble of optimized gear can completely change over the course of 30 minutes of adventuring. Yet Blizzard has ensured there's no waste: outdated items can be salvaged by the blacksmith or sold to the merchant in order to play for the blacksmith's training. Memorable items can be stored and you can endear yourself to friends by mailing them useful gear. For Blizzard, giving items a life beyond the battle itself is an art form."", ""Mailing gear is just one of a suite of exclusive social features for this edition, and I have no reservations in proclaiming that Diablo III: Ultimate Evil Edition is a candidate for the most accessible multiplayer game of 2014. Cooperative sessions allow low-level players to join experienced friends and reap the benefits of fast level progression and early access to better items. If you don't mind playing the story out of sequence, co-op let's you play later chapters based on the host's progress, and let's you continue your solo progress from that point without even needing to play through the middle acts. It's an uncommon practice that would normally cheapen the experience, but this method of fast-tracking makes it easier for newcomers to appreciate the series' appeal. Diablo III is immensely replayable, with some credit due to the post-campaign Adventure Mode and the staggering selection of 10 difficulty levels. The risk factors in these difficulties are superbly balanced; Normal is the path of least resistance, while each subsequent level above offers enticing and fitting rewards of experience and gold."", ""Diablo III: Ultimate Evil Edition is a reminder that you can never underestimate the effectiveness of a killstreak counter. While the PC version did provide a final death count after you pulled off consecutive kills in a short span of time, this update offers a rush akin to the hot-dog-eating contest at Coney Island. After 10 kills, a pop-up keeps a running count until the streak expires, and the more demons you kill, the greater your experience multiplier. When there are enough monsters to push you to 50, 75, or even 100 kills, you and your friends will transform from heroic explorers into bloodthirsty murderers. Diablo is many things to many players, and if you've come to the series because it gives you a rush similar to that of the Gauntlet franchise, Ultimate Evil Edition is bound to quench that thirst."", 'The killstreaks are part of a larger scheme of improvements meant to enhance momentum.

With the d-pad, you can now sort through new loot without having to open the menus, making it easier to drop gear more suited for your friends. For those sharing the screen on a single couch, loot has been earmarked for specific players and classes, creating one less reason to go into your menus. Beyond the killstreak onuses, there are other temporary atrribute improvements that result from destroying objects or killing specific enemies. Ultimate Evil Edition\'s message to you is, ""Keep killing, you can color in the map and sort through your loot later."" And it helps that there aren\'t any loading times during individual quests, and there is nary a frame rate issue, even when the screen is packed with scarabs, ghosts, and demons.

More areas means more monsters, and more monsters means more loot. This is the basis for the top-down view of the standard action role-playing game; how Diablo III stands out is in its pacing and how it manages to stave off boredom. Maps are labyrinthine but are never yawn-inducingly large. You never stay in one experience level for long and the rewards for leveling up are worthwhile and practical enough that you become that much more motivated to reach the next level."", ""Beyond the menacing hooded reapers and new quest content that can stretch into dozens of hours, one of the key draws of Reaper of Souls is the blessed crusader class. Conveniently accessible at the start of Diablo III, this holy warrior is perhaps the most well-rounded class, and as such, is a user-friendly choice for newcomers. The crusader's abilities in melee and ranged attacks, along with the support of high defense, underscore the challenges and tradeoffs of the other classes. The demon hunter, for example, is proficient at ranged attacks and is a superb contributor to any party, yet this class proves difficult to use during a solo playthrough."", ""Diablo 3: Ultimate Evil Edition feels like the happy conclusion of a two-year public beta, with the initial purchasers on PC bearing much of the grief with the auction house and the slow pace to reach level 60. Those who have held off up to this point will benefit the most, while those who got a head start on the PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360 versions will be able to transfer their saves to their new gen console of choice.

Its exploitable combat takes the sting out of victory, keeping late-game combat from being much more than a minor time-waster.

These are the same islands you explored in Risen 2, but they have been refreshed and redesigned, making Risen 3 more than just ""Risen 2.5,"" though the thematic gap between the second and third games in the series is not nearly as great as that between the first two.', 'Once you complete the tutorial, you gain access to most of Risen 3\'s fictional Caribbean-inspired map, and move from one island to the next via your modest sloop, which is later replaced by a more ornate vessel with its own crew. Along the way, you meet a number of friends who may accompany you on your journey, including returning sword-wielding bombshell Patty, who is your sister in this scenario. Patty is not the most interesting of these companions, one of whom can fight at your side at any given time. The assortment of comrades includes a ghostly pirate and a voodoo practitioner who\'s handy with a shotgun and shockingly good at handling his liquor. My favorite companion, however, was Bones, a druid with a phlegmy voice and a comedic form of bloodlust. (His constant warcry--""I\'m going to make a hat out of your skin!""--did wear thin, however, particularly when facing enemies that had no actual skin. That skeleton has no flesh, Bones!)', ""Bones, like the other companions, disappeared once or twice for no apparent reason, most often on the endgame island, where I sorely needed his assistance. (One of many bugs that make you wish Risen 3's nuts and bolts had been fully tightened.) And a shotgunner aside, most of your sidekicks are functionally the same, so don't expect them to exercise a wide diversity of skills. Luckily, you gain access to a variety of different powers of your own. It's easy to stick to the skills that enhance swordplay, given how vital close-quarters combat is during the early game. In time, however, you will be summoning hellhounds to your side and flinging ice shards at golems if you so choose."", ""Deciding which customization paths to travel isn't as simple as selecting possibilities from a skill tree. As with previous Risen games, you must first spend glory (that is, skill points) in order to meet a proper numerical threshold, and then purchase related skills from a trainer. Furthermore, not every kind of trainer is available on every island, so it takes time and money to gain access to the most interesting skills, which can take a dozen or more hours. If you fancy a bit of necromancy or crystal magic, it takes time to make those powers part of your standard repertoire. Luckily, voodoo dolls and spell scrolls let you conjure the elements before you reach that point."", ""It's a solid leveling system that subverts the economy in interesting ways, forcing you into meaningful choices in the service of your chosen play style. By the end of the game, I had put aside fencing weapons and picked up a supernatural orb that spewed forth waves of magic, a fine weapon when standing toe to toe with a demonic soul eater and its shambling minions. Sadly, those decisions are diminished somewhat by the combat itself, which is far more fluid than it was in previous Risen games, but is too easy to exploit. When the gods of battle smile on you from above, there is a nonetheless a flow to battle missing from the previous games; no longer does a single sand devil mean likely death on the very first beach you comb, now that you can dodge and block--two options that were absent when Risen 2 was released (though later patched in.) It's the possibility of facing intriguing new creatures that keeps combat from losing its luster entirely; giant crabs and claw monkeys give way to glowering dark spirits, charging artiodactyls, and growling gorillas."", 'What Risen 3 has that will keep you pressing forward is a sense of grand adventure, directing you from one lush island to the next while you seek to unite your body with your missing soul after your death and resurrection.', 'The combat system\'s very mechanics undermine themselves, unfortunately. The dodge becomes your ""get out of jail free"" card: you can repeat the move ad nauseum, avoiding damage even if you\'re simply doing somersaults against a wall. Your proximity to your enemy has too little bearing on the outcome of battle. Aggressive pirates can cross an improbable distance with a single swing, yet avoid your blade\'s anger should they activate a dodge animation, even if the dodge doesn\'t successfully remove them from harm\'s obvious reach. It was hard not to roll my eyes during certain combat scenarios--scenarios in which I could slash away at a giant troll from a ledge above without suffering any ill consequences, scenarios in which I fearlessly tumbled around like a single sock in a rotating clothes dryer. In time, I won most battles easily, and the great supply of available provisions ensured I was always healthy. In Risen, combat was frustrating, but at least every encounter was an event; in Risen 3, combat is rarely more than a mild entertainment.', ""That isn't so say that I didn't delight in taking on the undead gangs that pour out of Risen 3's portals to the underworld. Risen 2's magical shenanigans have been greatly expanded, allowing for colorful displays of fire and ice. It's easy to be disappointed in Piranha Bytes' decision to retread the same ground, but never did I feel like I was playing Risen 2 all over again. The world is now beleaguered, suffering from the onslaught of dark forces, and not alive with civilian activity in the way Risen 2 was. I was immediately struck by how this world was no longer buzzing with love and labor."", 'Later, however, I came to appreciate how fear had spread across the land, causing distrust among comrades and tearing apart towns that had once bustled with commerce. The solitary fortresses where the mages and demon hunters dwelled exuded a hushed mystery that seemed appropriate, given the seriousness with which both factions approached their business. Bones aside, few characters make an impression on their own, but almost every character speaks in a hearty and assertive tone. They have lived their lives and lived them hard--and there is still more hard living to be had.', ""Those robust characters serve a shrug-worthy save-the-world story whose primary purpose is to get you exploring lush jungles and mining crystals in winding caverns. It isn't the primary narrative but the little stories you encounter that make a noticeable mark, even when the vibrant dialogue is overshadowed by the nonsensical order some of the dialogue options appear in. (Why am I telling this pirate that I took care of the looming threat, when he was with me when I did it, and already handed me a reward?) I had a hard time caring about whatever political shenanigans the Inquisition was up to, but the adventurer convinced that ducks were staring at him as he slept? This was a story I needed to hear. Sure, I needed to worry about oncoming evils, but solving the mystery of a man's insanity was far more intriguing."", ""It's unfortunate that Risen 3 springs new irritations on you whenever it springs a new game system on you. Suddenly you're engaging in one of a few sea battles, which are fun new additions when they first appear, but still might have you wondering why the game doesn't provide you a cooldown bar for your side cannons, or why the final sea beast accosts you with attacks your ponderous vessel can't usually avoid. You might open your inventory window during battle to guzzle down some painkilling liquor, only to return to battle and find that the game has inexplicably sheathed your weapon on your behalf. Then there are soul points, which relate to an unnecessary morality system that doesn't seem to abide by any comprehensible set of rules. Sometimes you can be a jerk and have no effect on your soul standing; other times, you lose a point for being simply indifferent to another character's long-winded story. I never gleaned what consequence the soul meter had, and other mechanics--the dream sequences, the ability to turn on a type of spirit vision--were similarly half-baked."", ""I'm guessing, however, that if you're interested in Risen 3, you already have a certain expectation of it--one based on the developer's history of making interesting, exhaustive, clumsy role-playing games that manage to invest you in spite of their awkwardness. It's a matter of vision. Risen 3: Titan Lords is not the studio's grandest gesture, but the tendrils of this fantasy saga still grab you. The glitches and irritations poke at your patience, but the promise of buried treasure on a distant beach still compels you. Risen 3 has the potential to sweep you away, provided all that driftwood doesn't keep you at shore.""]"Josiah Renaudin,12-Aug-14,Hohokum Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hohokum-review/1900-6415841/,7,PS4,"['Hohokum shows you respect from the very beginning. Instead of leading with tutorial messages explaining how to make use of the slick and stylized movement, this vibrant, abstract trip lets you experiment with whats provided to discover how to interact with the world around you. No one tells you to drag the contours of your multicolored serpent through the petals of a towering flower, or collide with the porous edges of a sea sponge in order to affect the nearby wildlife. Each new world presents a medley of subtle environmental puzzle pieces that need to be pushed, pulled, flipped, and correctly bumped into place to create a clear picture, and it takes patience to fit them all together.', 'The non-linear, experimental gameplay is the greatest strength of this audiovisual jewel, but its also the core of its most pervasive fault. At its best, Hohokum provides pure, cathartic bliss through hypnotic movement thats extenuated by the free-form puzzles. No two worlds are the same, and the creative manner by which you complete them often slap a contagious grin on your face. However, once the heavy dopamine dose dwindles to a drip and your progression stalls, you begin to curse the given respect that was once so cherished. Failing to see the next step forces you to slither through every element of the geometry in frustration to find how to progress, transforming your previously relaxing session into a true test of commitment.', 'The greatest challenge might come from describing the game itself, though, as most of the worlds in Hohokum are brimming with nonsense. You direct a single serpent, dubbed the Long Mover, to sashay from place to place. You cant attack or communicate with the many people or objects that paint the backdrop, so youre instead left with no other choice but to bump into things. And once you bump into the right things, a light bulb goes off. Flying over a clay pot sends it crashing to the ground, so what happens if I break all of them? What will that change?', 'You play with the different pieces until the systems start to become clear, and after completing the given tasks in a world, a fellow serpent with its own distinctive colors and features is freed and sent back to your hub world. There are other secondary objectives to consider in each environment, but the real goal here is to find and free all of the serpents.', 'Credits roll once every serpent is safe, but Hohokum doesnt push you to progress to the conclusion. There were times when I wondered if I was even working toward a true ending, as the cheerful nature of this often aimless jaunt does its best to keep you in the moment. Each location has a personality all its own, and when youre barreling through silhouetted lamps that brighten to expose an otherworldly milieu, its difficult to think about much else but the brilliant lighting and melodic tones.', 'Hohokum plays like nothing else out there, and its presentation is just as idiosyncratic. Unearthly critters scurry by as you float between purple mountains and bright yellow monuments. A gem-strewn cave draped in darkness is just a short trip away from a farm with dynamic reds and blues that coat fields of wheat and healthy oaks. The fantastical characters blend perfectly with the make-believe worlds, and the glue that holds it all together is the soundtrack. The reactive electro beats ting, fizz, and buzz as you fumble over items, creating a singular sensory package that sticks with you.', ' ', 'All the worlds are open from the word go, giving you what initially feels like endless things to see and do. Its not necessary to free each and every serpent from the 17 available worlds to have fun with Hohokum, but I like seeing credits roll. I enjoy actually completing a game, and while I understand the appeal of spending 15 minutes after work casually exploring Hohokums charming locales, I wanted to get to the end. Unfortunately, that can be a chore.', 'Exploring all the available options within a given world is a treat, as theres great satisfaction that comes from the many ah-ha! moments that lead to freeing a new serpent. But I found myself unsure of the next destination on far too many occasions. Fresh worlds are accessed by opening portals in previously discovered areas, but without knowing where you should go next or how to get there, you find yourself frantically stretching from level to level without a clear focus. It becomes a boring scavenger hunt that sullies the pacing, and it often forced me to try to interact with objects in less obvious, more tedious ways in an attempt to crack the code.', 'Its easy to get lost in Hohokums enchanting scenes, but its just as easy to come crashing back down to Earth when you lose your way.', 'The silky-smooth flow of Hohokum amplifies these aggravating moments. How and in what order you want to complete the worlds is up to you, but you settle into a soothing rhythm once you begin to understand the systems. Its easy to get lost in Hohokums enchanting scenes, but its just as easy to come crashing back down to Earth when you lose your way.', 'The through line can be frustratingly faint at times, but Hohokum is just too creatively rich to pass up. The vibrant environments are ceaselessly pleasing, and few soundtracks better match their visual counterparts than the pair found in this ebullient playground. Whether youre carrying citizens on your snake-like back to a Ferris wheel or leading a school of fish through pockets of water, the charm so deeply embedded in Hohokumeven at its most frustrating pointsnever wears thin.']"Brett Todd,12-Aug-14,Sacred 3 Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sacred-3-review/1900-6415839/,4,PC,"[""What's in a name? If you take the example of Sacred 3, very little. Publisher Deep Silver may have pasted the name of this action role-playing franchise on its new entry in the hack-and-slash genre, but the game itself is little more than a meticulously mediocre button-masher that strips out the elements that make click-heavy RPGs so absorbing."", ""The clicking lacks inspiration; the script, inspired by equal measures of The Lord of the Rings and Leisure Suit Larry, lacks taste. Developer Keen Games never seems sure of whether to play the setting straight or to send up the tropes of heroic fantasy; as a result, the setting and narrative are all over the place. At first, it seems like you're stepping into the brawny boots of the usual hero in the usual elves-and-orcs saga. The fate of the realm of Arcania (the D&D-inspired land that also hosted the first two Sacred games) is at stake here. Lord Zane and his Ashen Empire are pillaging towns. Innocents are being slaughtered. Undead are rising."", 'Bizarrely, these themes are played for laughs. Comments by friends and foes alike consist of out-of-place observations and pathetic sex jokes that wouldn\'t raise a chuckle out of Beavis and Butthead. You can never escape this chatter, either, as you\'re constantly accompanied by a veritable broadcast booth of idiots. Psychic Aria is in your head all the time, ostensibly there to give you advice on what to do and where to go, but her true purpose is to blab away to herself. Villains get in on this party line, as do spirits residing in your weapons, including a perverted ghost who tells you about the things that he\'d like to ""get on top of"" whenever you pull off a leaping attack. Oh, and the heroes are also morons. The barbarian, for example, sounds more like Zoolander than Conan.', ""Perhaps this childish verbiage might have been forgivable if Sacred 3 had balanced it with solid gameplay--but it doesn't. On the contrary, the game is stripped down to the raw basics. There are just four different characters to choose from at the start of the game, all fantasy archetypes. You get the bulked-up Safiri barbarian tank, the jack-of-all-trades Ancarian lancer, the range-combat specialist Khukuri archer, and the magical blade-wielding Seraphim angel. None can be customized before delving into the hacking and slashing; you just make your pick from this limited pool of talent and then head into the campaign."", ""You can send your hero into the fray either on your own or cooperatively with up to three others online. It's easy to find a match to drop into, which you can do with just a couple of clicks from the main campaign screen. You can also readily move in and out of online and offline play, so the option for something different is always there. Still, I didn't notice any hidden dimensions of the game materializing when playing on a team. Scores are tracked so you can tell which member of your goon squad is the best killing machine, and there are a few added co-op features, like being able to revive fallen allies. Other than those minor tweaks, Sacred 3 feels much the same whether you're playing with yourself or with somebody else."", ""Character progression is weak, whether you're playing online or off. (A single character can be played and leveled-up in both modes of play.) There are no loot drops during combat, and there is no inventory to manage. Kill a bad guy, and you're showered with gold and shining orbs that boost health and power, but you never pillage artifacts like magical swords or ancient helms. Instead, the game doles gear out to you like rations as rewards for finishing missions and leveling up. Such delayed rewards killed much of my motivation to keep playing, because without the instant gratification provided by cool new gear and enchanted artifacts, the clicking feels too much like a pointless grind."", ""As a result, the entire game is played with just three or four weapons. There are limited slots for amenities like health potions and defense-boosting shield amulets. Each hero comes with default attacks plus shared special abilities, like a bash that can take down enemy shields, and an execution move that finishes stunned opponents. Only a handful of combat arts provides heroes with added class-specific abilities, like the Seraphim's thunderbolt, and the Safiri's fireblade. Most of the above can be upgraded by purchasing branches on skill trees that offer up added damage, wider attack range, and so forth, but such enhancements are not easy to come by. There are tough level requirements on most upgrades. Six or more levels separate upgrades on weapons, for example, and some upgrades take so long to acquire that they seem almost unattainable, especially in the early stages of the game. As a result, I frequently would finish a mission, load up my character screen to see what new goodies I could unlock, and then walk away frustrated because I didn't qualify for anything new."", ""Where the first two Sacred games were laid out like standard hack-slash RPGs, Sacred 3's 10-hour campaign consists of disconnected levels in wholly separate locales and dungeons. There are no quests to perform; you're not so much a part of an RPG fantasy world as you are a pugilist picking individual fights. The rigidly linear levels lack creativity. You follow a narrow path from one point to the next, killing everything you encounter along the way, only pausing occasionally to turn a wheel, pull a lever, or engage in some other generic interaction. The only break comes in the form of mini-levels where you either have to survive five waves of enemies, or wander around a small area killing everything that you encounter."", ""Enemies are repeated over and over again in both the story and arena levels. There are varied types of foes, but when you're killing thousands and thousands of them over the course of the game, there is still plenty of repetition. Much of the enemy horde consists of goblin-like monsters, giant spiders, trolls, and the like, although occasionally you get thrown a curveball like gross puking zombies or ice creatures. Nevertheless, even when the rogues gallery gets changed up, most of the differences are only skin-deep, as all enemies rely on just a few types of attacks. The tougher elite beasts, for example, have varied appearances, but almost all of them attack with identical charges and earth-shaking swings of their weapons. Levels also feature arcade-styled challenges like giant rocks or volcanic lava falling from the skies as you race forward trying to dodge this makeshift artillery, but this gimmick is repeated in practically every level. Ideas are repeated so often I occasionally thought I'd made a mistake and had accidently chosen to replay a level that I'd already finished."", 'Sacred 3 brings with it a number of positive elements that help ease the pervasive monotony. Boss battles at the end of each story level can be very challenging, often requiring you to take advantage of the scenery to survive, or to use some unusual strategy to turn the enemy against itself. Simply clicking as fast as I could and adding in liberal sprinklings of special attacks got me killed a fair bit of the time in these encounters. I had to actually think things through and get the lay of the land, not just charge forward. That came as a bit of a surprise in a game that was otherwise so simple-minded, but it was a welcome one.', ""All battles are frantic whirls of color, showing off some attractive visuals that fill the screen up with flying blood, explosions, and magic effects. Levels are wonderful to look at, with varied backdrops that range from jungles, to crypts, to quasi-factory settings. Environments have a lovely sense of depth, and the camera regularly pulls back from the standard perspective to provide an exciting panoramic view of important events happening in the distance. The primary drawback with the camera is that you can't adjust it during regular gameplay, which locks you into a perspective that's a little too close to the action to see where you need to go at times, but is also high enough up that you lose some detail in the hero and monster models below."", ""Sacred 3's primary primary flaw is that it's so easy to forget. It contains too little of what you look for in an action-first RPG, and distances itself it so far from its two predecessors that there is no meaningful connection left between the games besides the name and the setting. And that, as you can see from this example, doesn't mean much.""]"Heidi Kemps,7-Aug-14,Wii Sports Club Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wii-sports-club-review/1900-6415837/,6,Wii U,"['Wii Sports is an undeniably important game to the whole of gaming history. Its status as a pack-in with the original Wii was responsible for getting the console into millions of homes (and breaking a few TVs), but it also signaled a significant change in player demographics that had been a long time coming. As the Wii U struggles to gain the sort of consumer traction its predecessor had, Nintendo has reissued the now-classic Wii Sports package, updated with a bevy of new bells and whistles. But while Wii Sports was forward-thinking in its ability to engage a different set of game players, Wii Sports Club is a clunky attempt to bring the title up to the standards of current games. ', ""Wii Sports Club features the five original sports from its predecessor: Tennis, Bowling, Golf, Baseball, and Boxing. On a fundamental level, these play similarly to the original game, requiring the player to perform various motions to simulate the acts of swinging a racket, throwing a ball, or launching a punch. The Wii MotionPlus (or a Wii Remote with Wii MotionPlus built-in) is mandatory, and the additional range of gyroscopic control it provides adds a little bit more depth to these games: in Tennis, for example, it's a lot easier to control the type of swings you get than it was with the original Wii Remote, leading to greater control of the ball. Other games utilize the GamePad: in Golf, you position the GamePad on the floor, where it depicts the ball; you then swing the Wii Remote over the pad to hit the ball. Baseball lets you use the GamePad's gyroscopic features to pitch and catch the ball, which is a clever and fun new addition to the formula. For the most part, however, Wii Sports Club is all about that time-tested Wii Remote waggling. "", ""Besides the main games, Wii Sports Club also features mini-games that put twists on the various sports, like launching a tennis ball to hit whack-a-mole targets, trying to bowl down unusual 100-pin patterns, and playing bingo by launching golf balls onto a grid. These games can be played solo or with friends (though not online), and make for a nice distraction if you get bored of the standard sports. These games are all quite short, however, so don't expect to be enthralled by them for very long. "", 'One of the selling points of Wii Sports Club is its online features, and unfortunately, it\'s here where the collection falters the hardest. When you start the game, you\'re asked to join a regional ""club"" of your personal choosing. This isn\'t restricted by physical geography; I live in California, but I joined the Iowa club because I grew up in that state. You\'re supposed to socialize with other members of your club, forming friendships and rivalries with other territory clubs, but such socialization is uncommon because the online experience is simply not good at all. ', ""For starters, online play is restricted to very basic rules for each sport, with only bowling featuring any sort of significant rule variations to choose from. Finding opponents is also a challenge. I'd log on during prime time in the evenings, weekends and weekdays, pick my sport of choice, and be sent to a practice room where I'd wait for an opponent for a few minutes before being told the game couldn't find anyone and I would be booted back to the menu. I had the most luck finding people to play Tennis, but trying to find a person to play 100-pin Bowling was like pulling teeth. Looking at the game's Miiverse, I saw plenty of folks discussing their online games with others, so why wasn't I getting any sporting funtimes? "", ""It has much to do with the game's netcode. Wii Sports Club has serious, pervasive problems with lag and stuttering during games. Players in the Miiverse universally reported the same issues, making online play a bust. But beyond the online, how is Wii Sports Club at recapturing the magic of the original Wii Sports and getting non-typical players engaged in the game? I invited a few people I knew who aren't frequent game-players to partake in some virtual sporting with me. While they all seemed to enjoy the games--especially the new mini-games--the GamePad options proved troublesome. (There was a lot of worry about people and pets accidentally stepping on the controller during golf in particular.) There's simply no substantial improvement here--nothing to make the re-release a valuable upgrade over the original. "", 'On top of everything is a rather confusing pricing structure: You can obtain the game as either a free download or in a retail package, but the downloadable version only lets you play for a limited time before you have to purchase a $1.99 24-hour ""day pass"" or unlimited access to individual sports for $9.99 each. The package version doesn\'t have any such restrictions, save for the minor inconvenience of having to take the disc in and out of the console, so why not offer a simple, full-access download version as well? ', ""Wii Sports Club is emblematic of Nintendo's strange and silly approach to online games and distribution, given its unintuitive interface for finding sports partners, the consistently poor connection quality, and a pricing strategy that makes little sense. It works a lot better as a local game, but even then, it's not a massive improvement over the original title as a pick-up-and-play party pleaser. It's still great fun, particularly in short bursts, but it's hard to justify plunking down extra cash for Wii Sports Club.""]"Daniel Starkey,5-Aug-14,Halfway Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/halfway-review/1900-6415836/,7,PC,"['Space is cold, lonely, and wholly apathetic to the struggles of humanity. That inhospitality gives Halfway its emotive essence. It doesnt ask you to conquer, to win, or to triumph. Here, on a bent and broken ship aimlessly drifting through the infinite dark, youre just trying to survive. Halfway opens with Lannis, an aging security guard for the Goliath colony ship, coming out of stasis quite a bit later than he expected. Immediately its clear, both in the environments and the steady, solemn tones driving the ambient sound track, that this is not a happy story.', 'The lead into the more omnipresent feeling of dread is slow at first. Peeking and probing, you search about the first few areas of the ship, seeking other survivors. Even after establishing a rudimentary basecamp, the seemingly endless hordes of mutated crew members are an evolving and lingering threat. From your base, you launch missions with a growing group of survivors to gather needed food and supplies and ultimately take back the ship.', 'Each excursion has a series of core objectives punctuated by scripted, turn-based combat sequences. With the ship adrift, its computer has gone haywire and is warping the ship to random locations every few minutes. When one of these jumps triggers, whatever room youre in floods with intruders. Fighting these baddies off isnt terribly difficult most of the time, but if youre reckless, youll end up wasting scarce ammunition and resources. I lost several missions just because I was a bit too cavalier with my bullets.', 'As you progress, you fight tougher and more severe mutations of the Goliaths former crew. Some barely have any of their humanity left, and amount to little more than walking steel cans firing massive and deadly lasers from their chests. To combat the tougher foes, you need to scavenge for equipment--health packs, guns, and armor--and distribute them among your team. You can also find items which provide a permanent stat boost to your crews aiming, their agility, or their health. These pick-ups serve as role-playing elements that supplement the tactical core, although even with those additions there isnt much mechanical depth.', 'Each character under your command has two special abilities: one thats passive, and another than can be used every few turns. Besides using these skills and attacking, theres not a lot to do in a given turn. Theres only one proper defensive option, retaliate, and its not terribly effective as it only works if you are directly attacked as opposed to when an enemy crosses a threatened or monitored area. Most of the strategy comes from appropriate timing and movement. In addition to wasting ammo, wasting your abilities and having to wait for the cooldown to expire could mean a failed mission. For the most part, the lack of complicated tactical options doesnt matter all that much. It does, however, make some of Halfways difficulty spikes rise from challenging to maddening.', ""As I was nearing the end of my run, I hit a massive road block and it took half a dozen tries to finish the section. There were so many enemies, all with seemingly much better aim and armor than my own team. When I finally made it through, it was only because I took a side mission to get better gear, but even that run was substantially more difficult than the rest of the game. Those occasional spikes in difficulty also muddle the pacing of an otherwise laudable narrative. For the first few hours, theres brilliant mystery unfolding, built around the events that led to this disheartening circumstance and the methods used to recapture control. As the game approaches its climax, though, the brutal sequences kick in and the tempo halts. The abrupt difficulty is not a killer, but thats largely thanks to Halfway's non-gameplay pieces, and after a few failed missions, seeing your squadmates revived again and again undercuts the sense of despair and hopelessness that underlies the rest of the game."", ""Unlike with similar games like XCOM: Enemy Unknown and Fire Emblem, death is not permanent, and though Halfways message still resonates, the music and visuals are what properly express the game's thematic weight. Seeing a crewmate that barely survived your last mission gently pulling drags from a cigar as he looks out over the stars carries with it great emotion. Rooms are littered with the pieces of stories told in times past. Bullet holes, shell casings, and piles of ashes set the grim tone and remind you that your characters that they may not survive for much longer."", ""The morose tone is further darkened by a stellar soundtrack. The main theme kicks in with hard synth beats that evoke the era of science-fiction classics like Alien and Blade Runner before shifting into wistful, distant chords. Each battle theme is a faster, layered version of the same area's ambient music. This musical consistency establishes a constant sense of place and provides an extra bump of adrenaline for making action sequences feel exciting and important. The menu and home base tracks lack combat variants altogether, expressing the somber state of affairs and depicting how distant even the slightest hope for survival seems."", ""Halfway's environments, writing, and musical score convey a sense of quiet perseverance, but the gameplay doesn't communicate that feeling as clearly as it should. Persistent characters help give the adventure grounding, but Halfway doesnt have the conviction to make its subjects mortal. Yet there's something to be said for the way in which this foreboding game uses style to convey substance, pushing you from one battle to the next so that you might shed light on a chilling galactic mystery.""]"Jason Venter,5-Aug-14,Road Not Taken Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/road-not-taken-review/1900-6415834/,7,PC,"['Life can take many unexpected turns; failure or success at a key moment can mean the difference between heartache and bliss. Road Not Taken is an action/puzzle adventure with heavy roguelike elements that explores that motif. Despite a few disappointing issues, the developers at Spry Fox have pieced together an artistic and absorbing experience that touches upon themes of love, loss, and, ultimately, hope.', 'Road Not Taken begins when you, a hooded ranger, push through a blizzard and catch a boat ride to a snowy village. Its population is scarce. A few lonely figures wander the streets, and you soon find the mayor waiting on the east end of town. He promises you a roof over your head, but in exchange, you must lead the search for children who have gone missing while attempting to harvest berries in the harsh elements. That means wandering through a randomly generated region filled with hostile wildlife and other objects that stand between you, the children, and their parents.', ""Gameplay is divided between two areas. In town, you talk to villagers and learn their stories. One person might come from a wealthy family, for instance, and money is his language. Another feels the ticking of her biological clock; she yearns for a future with a house and kids, but there's no guarantee she'll ever find it without your aid. As the wandering refugee, you engage with the characters, handing over coins, rice, berries, medicine, or rabbits you have obtained. In exchange, you learn more of a specific character's story and perhaps gain new information for your records, or a charm or temporary energy boost. Your relationship can grow to inspire love, envy, or even marriage."", ""When you're not busy turning strangers into friends, you wander a wasteland that resembles a dungeon in The Legend of Zelda. Your magical staff allows you to lift adjacent objects (up to four at a time, one on each connecting side) and carry them or hurl them outward. Each item you might heft behaves differently when it connects with the proper obstruction. Often, such items simply fall in place, but sometimes you match the proper items; two orange spirits and a blue well of fire turn into a life-restoring apple, for instance, and combining a couple of sticks produces a fire. As you experiment and talk with villagers, you learn about other useful combinations."", ""Not every match you make is beneficial, so you should think carefully before you lift anything. Once any objects are lifted, you can't simply set them down again. Instead, you must either throw or carry them. The latter activity drains your energy meter with each step you take, unless a cheery fire is burning nearby. You need to make sure you don't produce an unintended match, and you also must be careful not to throw something so that it lands near another object you have no interest in subsequently lifting. Mobility is also a factor, since you can't squeeze through tight spaces if you are toting around too much junk. The amount of planning this sometimes requires can be intimidating, especially in later areas."", ""Screens in a given region are usually blocked by obstructions that disappear only when you make a specific match, and sometimes the necessary ingredients aren't all on hand. In that case, you must backtrack and toss the desired item--a tree, or a block of ice, or skittish wildlife, or something else of that nature--through an opening. In other instances, you might stumble across a wolf surrounded by deer. The carnivore will eat the other animals if you don't act quickly, perhaps eliminating your opportunity to ever advance to adjoining screens."", ""Situations such as the one noted above pose a serious problem, because children are located at the far reaches of each randomly-generated area. If you let a bit of bad luck or poor planning prevent you from reaching too many such screens, or if you carelessly carry items too long that could instead be tossed, you won't be able to save enough missing youths to meet the mayor's quota. If you fail twice or if you run out of energy, your fifteen-year run is cut short and you must start fresh."", 'Frustratingly, you don\'t keep anything important from one cycle to another. Neighbors and wandering adventurers you meet in dungeons sometimes give you charms, and you can equip two at once by default. Those charms do helpful things like reducing the number of children you must find, or causing restorative items to have a greater impact. One particularly great charm adds 200 points to an energy meter that otherwise might hover near 60 or 90. If you fail to complete the cycle, though, you lose it and might not find another to replace it for several more cycles. You do at least retain the ability to ""ban"" a standard maximum of two objects from the wastelands by visiting your basement, but there are dozens of items to worry about, and the option to eliminate only a couple of them hardly matters. Charms are significantly more useful, so it stinks to always lose them.', ""Road Not Taken is a difficult adventure, one that suits its name perfectly. Though you will likely fail many times as you attempt to finally reach the end of a cycle, there is almost always something to lure you back. Maybe you had almost reached the end of one character's story, and you are dying to see how it concludes. Or perhaps you discovered a new technique or combination, and now you'd like to put it to proper use on a subsequent run. There is something novel to discover on nearly every run, and online leaderboards provide yet another reason to keep trying again."", ""Unfortunately, the game currently suffers from some irritating bugs. Patches may address that eventually, but right now crashes often happen at a rate of several times per cycle. You can even lose your save file in the event of a severe crash, which makes their frequency distressing, even though typically you resume on the exact screen where you last played. Combine the lack of stability with the occasional cheap combinations of randomly generated rooms (not to mention your inability to keep charms from one cycle to the next) and you're left with a punishing experience indeed."", 'On a brighter note, the art style is charming and even uses some familiar icons from Triple Town, a popular mobile game from the same developer. The sprites are expressive and vibrant, which allows the game to spin bleak stories without getting overly depressing. Music is atmospheric, with a lot of the chimes and bells that always seem to accompany wintry landscapes in film and games, accompanied by haunting gusts of wind and the faint sobs of distressed parents.', ""Road Not Taken is an ambitious endeavor, a substantial puzzle adventure with that special something that keeps you returning for yet another trek through the harsh wilds. It's sometimes too unforgiving for its own good, but the urge to travel along another path is difficult to resist.""]"Josiah Renaudin,5-Aug-14,Metrico Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metrico-review/1900-6415835/,6,PlayStation Vita,"[""Metrico should be lauded for its creativity. Instead of using static blocks and a fantastical setting, this abstract puzzler hinges on scalable, everyday infographics the size and placement of which are beholden to your actions. Few people jump out of their seats to play with pie charts, line graphs, and bar diagrams, but developer Digital Dreams has managed to take the mundane and make it feel otherworldly in its PlayStation Vita debut. There's nothing else like it, but unfortunately, a novel concept and brazen soundtrack aren't enough to overcome a frustrating control scheme and often-empty set of challenges. There are flashes of brilliance born from the dozens of geographic puzzles, but the highs in Metrico aren't high enough to erase the lows."", '""Input Morphing"" is the term used to describe the adjustments you make to the environment, as different features of the world around you change shape, position, and orientation based on the location and action of your character. Moving left or right on the X-axis may raise or lower a single block on screen that\'s jamming the exit, while jumping up or down on the Y-axis could shift a longer pillar across the screen. You move from world to world, each of which contains multiple puzzles that increase in difficulty as you progress, with the conclusion of every world giving you the option of leaving through one of two colored doors.', ""How do your decisions impact the journey? That, along with your character's motivation for moving from start to finish, is unclear. Metrico creates the illusion of choice, and for a few moments, it feels like it's building to something greater than itself. However, the lack of a tangible narrative leaves too much for the player to decipher. I welcome ambiguity, but by the very end, I felt more lost than enlightened."", ""The ever-increasing difficulty stems from the fresh mechanics introduced in each of the six worlds. As you progress, you learn to shoot projectiles with a simple touch of the screen. Floating platforms swing left and right as you swivel and turn the Vita, and the camera even comes into play as you uncover gameplay hooks that take full advantage of the Vita's many inputs. Metrico quickly builds in complexity as you conquer screen after screen, but it sacrifices fluidity. It can be cumbersome to tilt your Vita--and often your body--to the exact angle being asked, all while using your camera, tapping the screen, and making a big jump. I frequently found myself spinning my machine every which way to move a bar graph to its maximum height in order to progress, struggling to get a grip on the sensitivity."", ""How do your decisions impact the journey? That, along with your character's motivation for moving from start to finish, is unclear."", ""It can feel like mobile Twister, and this helter-skelter scheme had me yearning for greater precision as I watched my silhouetted hero fall to his death over and over again. The puzzles themselves aren't so complex that you're left banging your head against the wall until the solution rudely slaps you across the face, but the actual difficulty of performing the necessary actions turns some levels into a slog."", ""When it all works in concert, though, the vision becomes clear. You're not told which piece of geometry will be altered as you move to the right, eliminate an enemy with your projectiles, or even fall to your death. In the more multifaceted levels, almost every action has a reaction, and there's an undeniable joy that comes from unraveling it all yourself. You're briefly shown what certain buttons or movements do once you begin a new world, but from there, it's up to you to actually take advantage of that ability to make it to the right side of the screen. Experimentation is paramount to success, and when the game's mechanics aren't pushing back, Metrico delivers the goods."", ""The most consistent facet of Metrico is its presentation, which beautifully blends its colorful edges with a soothing synthetic soundtrack. The particular visual style of each world is wonderfully complemented by its corresponding music, with each action resulting in a distinct auditory ripple. Sounds erupt and shapes appear as you scale new obstacles, but the most notable feat is that Metrico manages to remain aesthetically stimulating from start to finish. The many shades of purple, blue, and red you encounter wouldn't be nearly as striking without the accompanying melodies that fit like a glove."", ""Metrico looks and sounds the part of a critical darling, but laborious controls and empty narrative agency mar this chromatic trip. The many mechanics introduced from world to world often enrich the multiple puzzles you encounter, and the joy that comes from cracking the game's most complex codes is sublime. However, the erratic sensitivity of the Vita's motion control and overly indistinct theme hold Metrico back from being more than a fleeting curiosity.""]"Jeremy Signor,31-Jul-14,Magic: Duels of the Planeswalkers 2015 Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/magic-the-gathering-duels-of-the-planeswalkers-201/1900-6415832/,6,PC,"[""Aside from being the biggest, most important card game of the past 20 years, Magic: The Gathering has become a nexus point for different types of players. Some people get a kick out of building clever, efficient decks using powerful cards. Others love the thrill of outsmarting their opponents. And the countless variations that sprung from the original game speak to even more people, such as formats that force you to build decks from a limited pool of cards. A game like Duels of the Planeswalkers, which exists to speak to the greater game-playing community outside of Magic, should reflect this diversity in play. But even though Magic 2015 makes some significant additions that people have been asking for since the first Duels was released, its feature-light foundation and odd limitations keep it from being the joyous celebration of Magic's virtues that it should have been."", ""Of course, Duels was always meant to be a limited experience to some extent. It's the video game version of the most popular physical card game in existence, a simulation that allows interested parties to avoid the massive money pit Magic is associated with creating. The built-in Campaign mode also means you never need to worry about finding someone to play with, because the AI is more than capable of piloting the wide variety of enemy decks the developers programmed into the game. The game exists as a convenience, leveraging the power of the medium of video games to give us a way of playing Magic on our own terms, even connecting players across the world thanks to online play."", ""Ultimately, however, the primary function of Duels of the Planeswalkers is to be a big, fat advertisement for the physical game aimed at the video game enthusiast crowd. You need only look at the menu for proof, as an entire section is dedicated to promoting Friday Night Magic, the centerpiece of Wizard of the Coast's organized play for tabletop game stores, even going so far as including a store locator. As such, Duels condenses 20 years of Magic into a complete, standalone package designed to entice people to check out the paper game. A carefully-curated selection of cards ensures players aren't overwhelmed by choices, and premade decks eases them into the game without needing to worry about deck building until they're used to playing. As always, Duels of the Planeswalkers provides neophytes with a nice little cross section of the game proper without taking anything away its core."", ""In this light, 2015 represents a holding pattern. You still get a Campaign mode in which you face AI opponents using your pick of premade decks, you still win cards that can enhance your base deck, and the interface is still as friendly as it ever was, breaking down the many phases that make up each turn into easy-to-understand segments. The timer still makes thinking out turns awkward; you must rush to stop the countdown before you map out your next, a necessary conceit to make sure people don't stall out in multiplayer that feels unnecessary in Campaign mode."", ""One previously glaring omission that 2015 remedies is in the deck-building options. Until now, you couldn't meddle much with the decks you're given: the cards you won could only be swapped in and out of the deck it was paired with. Switching between decks wasn't allowed, and though this kept with the innate simplicity of the Duels series, it deprived players of one of the cornerstones of the Magic experience. 2015 allows you to put whatever cards you want into your deck; you may even tear the whole thing apart and start from scratch if you wish. Instead of winning individual cards, you win boosters from each Campaign game which let you further customize your deck and build a virtual collection of Magic cards. As a result, newer players can gain better understanding of the game beyond what was allowed before, encouraging experimentation and on-the-fly deck testing, an aspect that should have been possible in the series in the first place."", ""This new, necessary feature comes with an odd limitation: You're only allowed one premade deck before you're sent on your way and left to your own devices. This doesn't sound so bad at first; after all, that's how it works in real life. You get enough cards to build your own deck, and then you add to it as you get more cards. But giving players access to a multitude of premade decks in previous games showed off the true breadth of potential play styles, and, more importantly, what's possible in Magic. Limiting players to a single deck restricts them to one type of play style no matter what. It's difficult to change gears if something doesn't work for you because most of your cards are in the two colors you started with. Changing to a new color is out of the question until you build your collection further, which you can't do until you win more matches. It's a catch-22 that is only compounded by the way in which certain decks are weak against others, and since you now can't swap out decks, you will often find yourself bottlenecked."", 'The primary function of Duels of the Planeswalkers is to be a big, fat advertisement for the physical game aimed at the video game enthusiast crowd.', ""Beyond its new deck-building options, 2015 is characterized by a complete lack of modes beyond the single-player Campaign and multiplayer matches. Previous versions of the game included extra modes like puzzle matches, Archenemy, and Sealed Deck, each of which tested Magic skills in different ways. What you have with Magic 2015 is a stripped down version of what came before, which is a shame. The multitude of different ways that people enjoy Magic beyond the base game isn't represented in the slightest."", 'Instead, the biggest ""feature"" in 2015 is a new in-game store that lets you buy premium packs made up of cards that you can\'t earn within the game. Perhaps the game was meant to be more like Hearthstone or Magic online, games in which you\'re able to pay to add to your collection, but in reality, 2015 needlessly nickels and dimes, making it far less than a complete experience.', ""And yet even with all these problems, Magic: The Gathering is still the fun, challenging game it's always been. Learning the complex interactions between cards is a joy, and the game is extraordinarily replayable. 2015 also features newer cards from the Theros block and the Magic 2015 core set, so fans of previous installments can play around with cards and mechanics they've never tried before, which is enticing for existing Duels fans. People who want more Campaign mode and straight-up online multiplayer of the core game may be satisfied, if annoyed by the unnecessary deck limitations. Nevertheless, they are still better served going to their local store and checking out the physical game."", ""Duels of the Planeswalkers 2015 gives players what they've wanted for a long time by implementing deckbuilding, but it doesn't excuse the bare-bones package and needless extra monetization. The game within the template is still as fantastic as ever, and once you get into the groove, you'll enjoy stomping your enemies with your tuned deck. It's just a shame that 2015 never aspires to be anything more than a shell and delivery service.""]"Britton Peele,31-Jul-14,Rogue Legacy Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/rogue-legacy-review/1900-6415831/,8,PS3 & PlayStation Vita & PS4,"[""What will your children inherit when you die? Your house? Your debts? Your sweet record collection? The PlayStation port of Rogue Legacy has inherited its PC parent's engaging exploration and combat, mixing some of the best elements from games like Spelunky and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night to create a fusion that makes each individual play session feel distinct while also giving you a satisfying sense of progression. It may not have gained much in the transition, but Rogue Legacy is still as great as it always was."", ""Rogue Legacy drops you into a randomized castle that's very reminiscent of Symphony of the Night, not only in its map and exploration style, but also in combat basics, in the feel of the movement, and even in its many enemy types. You jump and slash your way through a 2D map with a sword and a variety of secondary weapons (including an ax that's thrown in an arc), fighting the likes of skeletons, flying skulls and sword-wielding heavies in bulky armor. Obtaining the ability to double jump or dash unlocks further exploration options, allowing you to find better chests that yield better loot. Rogue Legacy is far from a cheap Castlevania knockoff, but the inspiration is clear."", ""One of the main differences between the two games is that death is permanent in Rogue Legacy. When you die, you're done, and you must start a new adventure at the beginning of the castle next time around, though certain aspects remain constant. (For example, the forest is always on the right side of the map.) You don't collect much in the way of items or weapons, but when you die, those are gone too."", ""When other games in this vein talk about permanent death, they really mean it. You start over from square one, and you carry absolutely nothing with you. But in Rogue Legacy that's not entirely true. Any items you collected or enemies you killed are lost, yes, and the castle will be different the next time you enter it. But all the gold you collected stays with you, passed down to your child as an inheritance. You can spend that gold on equipment, buffs or permanent stat upgrades that persist with each run through the castle. So while you're not playing as the same character throughout the game, you're still getting stronger every time you play. Admittedly this can make the early parts of the game somewhat tedious, as you probably won't be powerful enough for certain enemies no matter how skilled you are at dodging attacks. On the flip side, that same grind provides a way for less skilled players to eventually brute force their way through even the toughest bosses."", ""It's this careful balance, this mix between steady progression and permanent death, that makes Rogue Legacy so enthralling. Each run feels important, because you will only see the end of the game if you can take out that next boss that you're struggling with, and you just know that this is the run, this is the time that it will all come together and you'll come out the other side alive. You've memorized the attack pattern and perfected your jump timing, so that boss is going down. But if you fail? If you fall to the castle's creatures before even reaching the boss? It wasn't all for nothing. A little piece of that character's legacy will live on, and you will carry better stats with you next time because of it."", ""But even though your base stats will carry on, each child--each new character you send into the castle--is still different, at least to a point. Every time you start the game, you are presented with three random descendents to choose from, and they vary in class and traits. Classes are your typical role-playing fare, with options like the barbarian, a class with a large amount of health, or the assassin, who is low on health but has a higher chance of critical hits. Traits are a little different, as they're random attributes that could have wildly different effects--or no effect at all--on how that character operates. Many traits are clever even when they make gameplay more of a chore, such as having a hero that is colorblind (thus making the game black and white) or a heroine who is a hypochondriac, which makes the damage numbers spilling from your character exceptionally larger than their actual value. Other traits are more pointless and even sophomoric, such as the I.B.S. trait that makes you fart randomly. Still, these neat elements of randomness help mix up the individual playthroughs."", 'All three PlayStation versions of the game (PS3, PS4 and Vita) are virtually identical, with the Vita version only missing out on one ultimately pointless feature, a trait that induces ""random muscle spasms"" and makes your controller vibrate. All three are wonderful versions of the game, though the text on the Vita version can be blurry and hard to read at times. They also contain extra content that was added to the PC version after its initial release, including new traits, new rooms, and, most noticeably, remixed versions of the game\'s bosses that provide a good challenge to anybody who seeks them out. Rogue Legacy supports Sony\'s cross buy and cross save features, letting you pick up your saved PS4 game on your Vita with relative ease.', ""It's almost unfair to compare Rogue Legacy to other games that emphasize permanent death. It doesn't have the secrets of Spelunky and it's more predictable than The Binding of Isaac, yet at the end of every game comes a desire to hop right back in, spend your gold on some upgrades and rack up more monster kills, something the game encourages with a challenging new-game-plus option that appears after the credits roll. Whether you play it on your home console or on the go, it's worth exploring Rogue Legacy's castle again and again and again.""]"Kevin VanOrd,28-Jul-14,Only If Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/only-if-review/1900-6415830/,2,PC,"[""The first time Only If induced rage was when I returned to its single major choice--a point at which you must choose one chess piece over another. No matter which piece I chose, the game surged forward in the same manner, leaving me to wonder if it were passing judgment on the illusion of player agency in video games. Given the way the dialogue often focuses on the player character's lack of control, it was easy to presume that the Italian-American caricature that guides you through the game was playing a role similar to the narrator in The Stanley Parable, pointing out the limitations of the medium through humor and self-aware gameplay. As it happens, I was giving Only If too much credit: the game had simply broken, and returning to the title menu was not a proper fix. Only after closing the game and restarting it did it function properly, shattering not the illusion of player control, but the assumption that I was playing a working product."", 'The second time Only If induced rage was when the player character called the apparent mafioso taunting him a ""pedophilic faggot,"" a homophobic outburst that may have worked had the character using the phrase been a full-fledged human being rather than a randy adolescent with no empathetic characteristics. Only If had already toyed with homophobia with a bit of throwaway dialogue about ""giving the kid the D,"" but that conversation lingered because of how it informed the plot, not because of its blatant offensiveness. The sputtered ""faggot"" accusation came later, after I had come to suspect that the game was not in fact a clever mystery but instead a perverted display of bro-dude self-expression. My suspicion was confirmed when Only If concluded with a story ""twist"" that M. Night Shyamalan might have concocted if he were a drug-addled, sexually frustrated high school senior.', ""Only If's ending marked the third time the game induced rage, and it was a rage that dogged me as I played the game a second and then a third time, hoping to find signs of a message with greater meaning than the disgusting finale let on, but if such a message exists, it is either too subtle to notice or too unnecessary to care about. Perhaps Only If means to parody games like Proteus or Gone Home, experiences that use simple forms of player interaction to reveal greater truths and subvert expectations, but I don't believe this game has such noble ambitions."", ""If my thought process is all over the place, it's because Only If itself brings with it no apparent logic, jumping between gameplay styles faster than Mario leaps between platforms. Games have successfully played with player perception of genre and game logic, of course--Thirty Flights of Loving is one great example of this kind of thematic skewing--but Only If's gameplay is frequently busted and typically uncomfortable. It all begins after you've awakened after an apparent night of intoxicated debauchery and sexual romping, with an angry voice taunting you via old-fashioned radio."", ""Soon after, the voice leads you to an opulent room in which a chessboard rests on a table and landscapes adorn the walls. Only If then presents a choice that's meant to be uncomfortable, but most discomfort comes from the game's own screen tearing and jittery behavior in these early minutes. At this stage, you might suppose Only If is a puzzle game, but if it is, it's a terrible one, providing the exact steps to the task at hand both here and elsewhere, and never allowing your imagination to blossom. In any case, the choice leads to one of the game's two branches, one of which leads back to this same parlor and forces you to make the other decision anyway. So much for facing the consequences of your own selfishness, which the foul-mouthed narrator intimates is the purpose of the 45 minutes of gameplay that follow."", ""Those 45 minutes are indeed a punishment, but for you the player, as opposed to the manchild you control from a first-person view. A few vignettes are sewn together, each providing an arbitrary rule for you to follow, such as running toward an orb before the walls of the surrounding limbo close on you, determining whether the button prompts wish you to press the assigned key or quickly mash it, or navigating a marsh without colliding with a patch of floating darkness or inadvertently wandering out of the level. This is trial and error gone wrong, with Only If chastising you not for failing to overcome an obvious challenge, but rather for not being able to read the creator's mind. After these random scenes of weirdness, you must escape a house where more capricious rules govern your direction, and where puzzles are so tedious that even the main character himself complains about them."", 'In spite of the clumsy gameplay and abysmal storytelling, a few ideas glimmer just brightly enough to grab your attention. On specific occasions you hear the voices of armed pursuers and see the beams of their flashlights, and while these unseen stalkers can catch you, you never see their bodies or faces. Such moments provide a twinge of intensity, forcing you to run away or find the prescribed hiding place so that you can catch your breath. The other story branch brings with it a new set of environments and metaphysical exploration, and there, too, you notice beacons of hope: puzzles in which you type out commands on your keyboard, attractive pastoral music that matches the beauty of the vibrant flowers and blooming trees that surround you, and enough enigmatic visual and audio cues to make you wonder about the nature of this world and your place within it.', ""Any goodwill Only If earns only fuels further disappointment, however, dwindling away during a tragic platforming sequence that highlights the game's unresponsive controls and incessant glitches. Eventually, the bite-size levels lose any sense of continuity, with every new pseudo-clever mechanic seemingly pulled from an ever-rotating bingo ball cage, and each sequence glitched or bugged in some manner or another. The insulting finale may be devoid of creative worth, but it at least signals the end of an experiment that was best left unperformed."", ""Given the appropriation of elements associated with narrative-driven exploration games like The Stanley Parable, you'd suppose that Only If were trying to communicate something meaningful. After all, buggy behavior and clunky locomotion make it a mechanical failure, leaving the story and themes to make good where gameplay could not. Alas, irredeemable characters and loathsome dialogue aren't appropriate pillars upon which to erect a substantial tale. The collapse was inevitable; Only If's wretched ending only ensures that the construct's remnants are reduced to unrecognizable rubble.""]"Cameron Woolsey,28-Jul-14,Gods Will Be Watching Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/gods-will-be-watching-review/1900-6415829/,6,PC,"[""Gods Will Be Watching makes you question your role as a spacefaring hero. You are goaded into thinking that you can accomplish each of the game's challenges with grace. But things are never quite that easy. The choices defined as good or bad are not so easy to make; hard decisions can come with a great cost, and sometimes sacrificing a few is not only inevitable, but necessary for the sake of many. Though the game provides excellent challenge and unforgettable emotional moments, highly randomized levels and irritating glitches ultimately diminish the emotional impact Gods Will Be Watching so desperately tries to impart."", ""The game leans heavily on sci-fi cliches to tell its story. The plot involves government corruption, slavery, and an interstellar terrorist group that can be stopped only by a legendary military hero, worn down by years of service. Though it felt familiar, I found myself taken in by the story, especially with the scenes that emphasize the inner turmoil of the game's enigmatic protagonist, who questions his purpose in the universe. The rare yet wonderful moments of human emotion that occasionally popped up were not expected, and won't soon be forgotten. But despite the interesting story, the game's primary focus is not on its narrative. At its core, Gods Will Be Watching is a resource manager, where the fates of many lives are in your hands."", ""Across most of its six chapters, the point-and-click puzzler places you in a room with a group of people and a set of tasks to complete in order to reach a certain goal before the end of a timer. The timer varies, ranging from a typical countdown to the setting of the sun in a passing day. You are given a set number of actions before the timer moves ahead. The available actions are separated into color-coded tasks of green and red, and it's important to note the difference between the two. Green tasks allow you to assess a situation by asking characters questions on how to approach a puzzle, or by checking in on everyone's mental status. Such queries can be made without passing any time."", 'Red tasks are the actions you perform to advance in the completion of the puzzle. They can range from rotating members of a dig team clearing a blocked exit in one scene, to writing a motivational speech to boost team morale in another. Performing a red task, however, comes with a caveat: with every move, you burn away precious time from the meter. If you fail to reach your goal before the clock hits zero, you must restart the mission.', ""The game has strict rules for how many actions you can perform at a given time, and if you're not observant, it's easy to make a mistake that could cost you dearly. In the early stages, I found myself perplexed that the game prevented me from accomplishing more tasks in a given time. In one mission, I was charged with keeping my team alive in a harsh, frozen environment. It seemed straightforward; however, I once forgot to put wood on the fire because I was busy crafting sharpened spears for hunting food, as well as focusing on repairing a busted radio necessary for calling in a rescue. I only noticed the innocent mistake just as the sun set on the distant, mountain-peaked horizon, and by then it was too late. The game informed me that my team had frozen to death, and I had to try again."", 'Success in Gods Will Be Watching requires a lot of trial and error, as well as many restarts. But though the missions are challenging, they rarely feel unfair. Most failures come from negligence, such as in the aforementioned example, or by pushing things beyond a breaking point. To elaborate, your first mission has you keeping four hostages in line while impeding a group of officers as you download data from a computer. Threatening or hurting the hostages keeps them from getting any clever ideas, but too much pressure causes a revolt, and you lose your leverage. On the other hand, too much leniency encourages them to fight back, and once more you end up with a major problem on your hands. Gods Will Be Watching is a game that challenges you with an abundance of difficult problems, many of which prey on your morals.', ""It's fitting that the lead character is named Burden, because he faces moral dilemmas that would weigh on the shoulders of even the most stalwart individuals. The line separating right and wrong is often blurred in Gods Will Be Watching. Eschewing traditional choice systems where you can pursue a clearly defined good or evil path, the game often presents situations where the right choice doesn't always produce a good outcome, and sometimes survival means making sacrifices."", ""One chapter has you trapped in a cave sealed by debris, where you must produce an antidote to a deadly virus--which has infected the whole team--within a time limit. You must use a small team of scientists to concoct an antidote out of a mix of different compounds. But with no one else around, you have to use your team as test subjects for this possible cure. You can inject a weak dosage into a character, which allows you to move toward finding a cure at a leisurely pace. But as the clock counts down, you face the reality that you will progress at a faster pace if you use more lethal dosages. So, what should you do? Should you endanger the lives of your teammates with a possibly deadly antidote, or risk losing everything if you don't? The situations are stark and brutal, and rarely offer easy choices."", 'Gods Will Be Watching is defined by sentimental moments cleverly designed to foster emotional attachments to some characters, which in turn informs how you approach missions. One particular moment that stuck in my mind occurred during a chapter that consisted entirely of a torture scene--yes, the whole chapter. Between moments where I witnessed knees being hammered and teeth being ripped from jaws as I uncomfortably squirmed in my seat, there existed moments where the two characters, Burden and his friend and fellow soldier Jack, sat alone tied to their chairs.', ""Tortured during the day, the men used the time at night to raise their spirits; Burden recited encouraging speeches, while Jack reminisced about the simple pleasures of life outside of war, going so far as to jokingly talk about leaving it all behind to become a farmer. It was the kind of dark humor that only two people who have known each other for a long time, through many desperate situations, can share. The following day, I found myself less willing to make Jack take the brunt of the torturer's anger. I wanted to try to see Jack and Burden through the ordeal, because while the dream of a peaceful life was laughed about, it was still a dream worth holding onto."", 'The game is designed with minimalistic but colorful aesthetics, and developer Deconstructeam created some rather brilliant ways for the visuals to convey emotion. Not long after that dreaded torture scene, you are presented with a gorgeous purple sunset that washes away the gruesome memories of pliers and steel grates caked with blood. The many detailed animations are just as fantastic. In one moment, the crack of a rifle causes a room of hostages to flinch in shock, perhaps causing the prisoners to grab their knees and hold them close to their chests. Emotional nuances can also be incredibly subtle. The movement of one pixel, representing the tapping foot of a torturer as he seeks out a ""negotiation"" tool on a wall of deadly instruments, somehow creates far more anxiety than the devices themselves.', 'At its core, Gods Will Be Watching is a resource manager, where the fates of many lives are in your hands.', ""Gods Will Be Watching is not without its problems, some of which are serious. One of the more unfortunate issues lies with story continuity. In many chapters, not all characters make it out alive, depending on your actions. However, the narrative doesn't mark that against you because you quickly discover that the dead characters continue along with the story, despite their previously deceased nature. Naturally, I was confused at first. I half expected the game to explain how they were clones. But no, they just came back to life with no immediate explanation. It does make some sense, since subsequent levels would be impossible without a full team. Still, their resurrection removes the impact of their deaths, and by the fourth chapter, I found myself no longer caring for their safety as I once had. The game does go so far as to offer a possible explanation behind their inferred immortality, but by then, it no longer mattered."", 'During its second half, Gods Will Be Watching begins to fall apart. Glitches crop up in swarms, causing the game to crash to desktop or characters to get stuck in various objects, forcing you to restart the level. Even worse than the glitches are the two chapters late in the story that replace the challenging puzzle mechanics with completely randomized situations.', ""The most damning example is the fifth chapter, where you must guide a small platoon of soldiers to their base camp while attempting to survive a scorching, nightless desert. You are given only vague directions to the camp, and getting there is a nightmare. You don't know what lies ahead of the group. It could be a stretch of desert, or an enemy camp that you have to either circumvent or attack with your limited stock of ammunition. You can send scouts ahead, but it takes time, and there's a chance they could disappear. More than once I had almost reached the base, but either a wall would appear ahead of me or I'd end up surrounded by enemy bases and my ammo had run dry a while back. The mission was infuriating, and it soured my experience with the game; I impatiently flew through the final missions, driven by the desire to leave the fury behind me."", ""At its best, Gods Will Be Watching is brimming with challenging puzzles and an emotionally charged story starring memorable characters. The game is hard, but that immense difficulty makes surviving to the next chapter all the more satisfying. It's unfortunate that many of those enjoyable moments are overshadowed by glitches and frustrating randomized levels late in the game. Gods Will Be Watching was close to being a must-have puzzler, but it's doubtful that even the gods would have the patience to see it through to the bitter end.""]"Britton Peele,28-Jul-14,Siesta Fiesta Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/siesta-fiesta-review/1900-6415828/,7,3DS,"[""There's only so much you can do with the Breakout formula. At some point it all boils down to moving a paddle back and forth in order to hit a ball that in turn hits (and breaks) blocks, just like the Atari classic. But while the formula has been cloned and twisted numerous times over the decades, there are still times when the resulting game is well made, charming, and just different enough to make playing it a joy...or perhaps even a fiesta."", 'The ""ball"" in Siesta Fiesta is actually a character named Siesta. He\'s fallen into a remarkably deep sleep and doesn\'t realize he is drifting away to an island full of colorful creatures called fiestas. As the fiestas take Siesta on a tour of their colorful world, you control his bed at the bottom of the screen using either the stylus, the control pad, or the D-pad, with the stylus option being the most accurate. As Siesta bounces into the air, you want to move his bed below him to make sure he doesn\'t fall to the ground. If you tap the screen or hit a button right when Siesta lands on the bed (that is, when the ball hits the paddle), he travels higher than normal.', ""Again, this almost certainly won't sound new to you, but Siesta Fiesta does a few things to make it more than just a charming Breakout clone. For starters, rather than being static screens, most of the levels scroll from left to right. As the world moves, hitting targets with high point values becomes a test of not just accuracy, but also speed. If you can't break a certain block or get Siesta through a specific set of markers before they scroll off the screen, you miss out on a lot of points. At the end of each level, you are awarded a medal. You get bronze simply for making it to the end, while upgrading to silver can be a challenge in many cases. Gold medals are not handed out easily, and I ended the game with very few of them."", ""Siesta Fiesta does a surprisingly good job of mixing things up throughout the adventure. New block types and power-ups are introduced, some of which add a puzzle-like quality to the game. For example, there are arrow blocks that direct a fireball in the direction they're pointing, and a separate block rotates said arrows. Getting the arrows rotated just right before unleashing the fireball is key to earning a high score, especially if you can do it without hitting any blocks that deduct points from you."", ""Occasionally you encounter time trial levels, which encourage you to race to clear several screens of blocks as quickly as possible. Other levels alter your paddle, giving you (for example) a fan that levitates Siesta instead of bouncing him. At the end of each of the game's eight worlds you fight a boss, which usually involves a bit of brainpower to figure out how to make the enemy vulnerable before attacking it. It's not the most demanding mental activity, but the game encourages a surprising amount of thought and strategy."", ""Outside of the game's 64 levels, there's not much to explore. You're given a score, but there are no leaderboards, and there are no side games or infinite modes to occupy yourself with when the story is done. Still, the handful of hours it takes you to run through the game is probably enough to satisfy, and you're encouraged to go back to collect gold medals on every stage if you're still hungry for more."", ""Even without Siesta Fiesta's own twists and turns on the tried-and-true gameplay, it would be a very charming, well-made Breakout game. The music is upbeat, the visuals are colorful and nicely animated, and the basic physics of the ball bouncing on the bed/paddle feel nice. But the game's insistence on mixing things up makes it joyful throughout. Siesta Fiesta may not keep you coming back when it's over, but it's a lot of fun while it lasts.""]"Carolyn Petit,28-Jul-14,The Last of Us Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-last-of-us-remastered-review/1900-6415827/,8,PS4,"['What makes life worth living? The Last of Us tries to answer that question by giving us a vision of a world that makes no room for people to really live their lives anymore. In this post-pandemic military-ruled society, the most anyone can hope for is merely to survive. And as many characters in the game know, in a world where the survival of anyone from one day to the next is uncertain, attachments, connections, love--these things can become liabilities. These things can destroy you.', ""Naughty Dog's acclaimed action game has made its way to the PlayStation 4 as The Last of Us Remastered, and if you've played the game on the PlayStation 3, you'll probably notice that it runs at a higher frame rate and that the lighting is richer and moodier in this release. In side-by-side comparisons, it also becomes apparent that the textures are sharper and the draw distance has been increased. But the reality is that the game already looked so good on the PlayStation 3 that the visual enhancements can't do all that much to improve your experience. The Last of Us Remastered is still The Last of Us, and that is no bad thing. It's one of the best adventures of the last console generation, and it's fully deserving of the special-edition treatment it gets here."", ""Perhaps nobody knows the dangers of loving others in this uncertain world better than Joel, the protagonist of The Last of Us. A hard, bitter man, Joel isn't likable, but he is at least understandable, in large part because the dialogue in The Last of Us is so human and believable. And although that humanity comes through in all of the game's major characters, it's the teenager Ellie who is the game's emotional heart. In contrast to Joel's cynicism, Ellie is still capable of wide-eyed wonder. While Joel seems dead inside, Ellie is very much alive, and over the course of the game, neither Joel, nor you, can avoid growing attached to her."", ""Still, if you think too carefully about the importance the story places on the connection between these two characters, things start to fall apart a bit. Because The Last of Us is an action game that adheres to the established template of the genre, over the course of your journey you murder not just one or five or 12 people, but dozens and dozens of them, and it's questionable whether a man who treats the lives of so many of his fellow human beings as so disposable would really be capable of placing any meaningful importance on the life of one particular individual. You can't soil your hands with the blood of hundreds and still have room for love in your heart."", ""The story is set in a world where every human life is in constant danger, and the harrowing combat of the game supports this feeling. Whether you're fighting ordinary humans or infected ones, you're encouraged to rely on stealth, distracting enemies and sneaking up on them to save your precious supplies. But you're always on edge, aware that you might be spotted and that all hell will break loose. There's a gut-wrenching brutality and sense of desperation to the way Joel fights, bashing his enemies' faces into the environment or stomping them into a bloody mess. The Last of Us is not a game in which you can boldly charge at your enemies with guns blazing. Instead, you rummage through every abandoned house, store, and workplace looking for things you can use to craft weapons and health kits. This emphasis on scrounging for supplies helps ground the combat in the world of the game, a world in which nothing can be taken for granted."", ""Because every enemy poses a serious threat, there's a real fear of being spotted, or of an enemy coming at you from behind, so you try to stay aware of your surroundings. One type of infected, the clickers, see by using echolocation, and the sound of their clicking is unsettling enough to make your skin crawl. As in the PlayStation 3 version, the tension of combat is sometimes undermined when your allies behave erratically, doing things that would get you spotted and killed. But then there are moments in which your companions' behavior creates the feeling that you're not alone on this journey, such as when Ellie comes to your rescue by stabbing your assailant in the back."", 'You explore so many places--old pizzerias and coffee shops, hotels and record stores--all of them designed with an attention to detail that makes them feel like places where people once went about their lives.', ""The nerve-racking intensity of combat is mercifully not a constant throughout The Last of Us. The pacing of the game is excellent; this is a game that's willing to take its time, letting you just inhabit a moment and take in the atmosphere rather than constantly rushing you to the next explosive action sequence."", ""There's a melancholy beauty to the game's world that seeps into your heart in these quieter moments. On the one hand, your breath might be taken away by the sight of cities being slowly reclaimed by the lush greenery of nature, but on the other, it's hard to forget that this beauty tells the story of the decline of humankind. You explore so many places--old pizzerias and coffee shops, hotels and record stores--all of them designed with an attention to detail that makes them feel like places where people once went about their lives. Even in its quietest moments, though, The Last of Us doesn't let you get too comfortable. The calm always gives way sooner or later to another frantic chase, terrifying siege, or other uncomfortable reminder that this world isn't nearly as tranquil as it sometimes seems to be."", ""The Last of Us Remastered includes the original game's multiplayer mode, along with all of the map packs that were released as downloadable content. The multiplayer successfully captures the unnerving feeling of the single-player combat, and wraps it up in an engaging metagame about trying to sustain a camp full of survivors by gathering supplies and completing specific tasks during missions. You can give the mode an extra emotional punch by linking it to your personal Facebook account, enabling you to see updates about your real-life friends dying as your camp flounders."", ""And then there's Left Behind, the extraordinary DLC story chapter for The Last of Us, unlocked here from the beginning. While the main game's narrative concerns with the importance of interpersonal connections and the gameplay's focus on combat and violence are somewhat at odds with each other, Left Behind takes the established mechanics of The Last of Us and uses them to support its story of the bond between Ellie and her friend Riley. Playing as Ellie, you and Riley toss bricks at car windows, hunt each other with water pistols, and do other things together, and all the while, the characters say honest things to each other, laugh with each other, get angry with each other, and do other things that real people do."", ""By giving you these glimpses of Ellie's doomed attempts to live something resembling a normal teenage life, Left Behind drives home what Ellie has lost as a person by growing up in this harsh world. The bond that forms between Ellie and Riley, supported both by the gameplay and by extraordinarily natural writing and acting, feels real. Left Behind crams more memorable moments into its short running time than you find in most full games, and it understands that some of the most important moments we share with others are the smallest: a brief glance, a fleeting smile. This remarkable DLC has real character development and real emotional payoff."", ""In addition to the visual enhancements and the inclusion of map packs and story DLC, The Last of Us Remastered has other nice little features, like a photo mode that lets you stop the action at any time, position the camera to your liking, and share the screenshot with others, applying frames and filters if you choose. And there are commentary tracks on in-game cinematics featuring the creative director and principal actors. The Last of Us is a great action game that you should play if you haven't already. And if you have played it before, the improvements here aren't so dramatic as to make the game feel like a new experience, but it is definitely one worth revisiting. In the world of The Last of Us, as in our own world, love might destroy you, but it's also one of the only things worth fighting for.""]"Brett Todd,25-Jul-14,King's Bounty: Dark Side Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/kings-bounty-dark-side-review/1900-6415826/,8,PC,"['Depending on your age, it might be difficult to get John Cafferty & The Beaver Brown Band\'s ""On the Dark Side"" out of your head during the entire 30-ish hours it takes to finish King\'s Bounty: Dark Side. Comparisons to a hit single seem oddly apropos here, given how this turn-based strategizer sticks to your brain. The latest addition to the long-running fantasy franchise is expectedly excellent, thanks to tremendous tactical depth both on the battlefield and with character progression, loads of monsters to command, and a turned-on-its-head story that gives the bad guys a starring role.', ""The plot is straightforward, although there are significant twists and turns from past King's Bounty games. Here, for the first time, you get to choose your starting race. And those races are a long way from the usual heroic figures you guided before. You choose between a vampire lord, a sultry demoness, and an orc warlord, each of whom has been booted from his or her homeland by white-hatted servants of the light. The writers soft-sell a bit of the evil stuff with explanations about how there always has to be a balance between the light and the dark, and a lot of nudge-nudge, wink-wink humor has been tossed in. (Some translation problems with the text make it hard to take anything too seriously here, in any case.) But the bottom line is that you portray an evil, murderous jerk who turns peasants into zombies for kicks, slaughters enemies for laughs, and seeks out the best people in the land to corrupt for a dark spell that will be used to forge the ultimate anti-good-guy weapon."", 'This ne\'er-do-well saga is lengthy, too. All three protagonists get together early on under the guidance of a cowled evil spirit, who provides tips on how to get rid of the light forces. The game is single-player only, and there are a good 30 or more hours of play here. Difficulty settings are dead-on, too. Easy is exactly what it should be, a cakewalk where you rarely find your armies seriously challenged, and the following levels step things up acceptably until you get to the aptly named ""impossible."" Since tactical fantasy games like this tend to lean on the tough side of things (I still have nightmares about the Disciples series, and there were excruciating moments in the earlier King\'s Bounty games as well), it\'s good to see a broad range of difficulty settings to accommodate all players.', 'As in earlier games in the series, the story plays out over a number of islands that you gradually explore and conquer for the dark side. All come complete with various maps that feature the usual twisty-turny pathways stocked with loads of goodies like chests of the gold that serves as the sole in-game currency and magical artifacts. The isles are attractive, if a little on the cartoony side, and so packed with detail that you may have to squint to make out various types of objects that you can take or rummage through, like snake eggs, chests, coffins, and funeral urns.', 'You portray an evil, murderous jerk who turns peasants into zombies for kicks, slaughters enemies for laughs, and seeks out the best people in the land to corrupt.', 'Quests are as detailed as the landscape, with intricate plot points, plenteous dialogue from non-player characters, and multiple steps that make it seem as if you are playing a proper role-playing game instead of a tactical game with a dash of RPG flavor, as is usual in this genre. Granted, a lot of these assignments are basic ""go there, kill them"" deals or delivery jobs. But they still got me more involved in the proceedings and made the world more of a living, breathing place than just a place filled with incessant battle arenas. I became attached to my vampire lord alter ego (although I did want to rename him, since Daert isn\'t exactly an intimidating moniker for a prince of darkness), even when he was vamping princesses and beheading kings. Unfortunately, the game doesn\'t track nearly enough information about what you\'re supposed to be doing in the quest logs; Instructions are generally given out during dialogue sequences with NPCs, but they\'re not stored for easy access later on.', ""Confusion is not a problem when it comes to battle arenas, which make up the majority of King's Bounty: Dark Side. Even with all of the game's intricacies, the main maps are just places where you scare up battles with patrolling or stationary enemies. As is traditional in the tactical fantasy genre, you serve as the general of a small army of Tolkien refugee troops, slotted into five positions. Your protagonist's leadership score governs how many creatures can be commanded at any given time. This--plus the cost of troops, their availability (which isn't really a concern after the first couple of islands, since you always have ready access to strongholds via teleportation and local shops selling just about every manner of unit you could want), and the tactical concerns governing which sorts of soldiers you want to take into battle against certain enemies--is at the heart of the game."", ""You have a tremendous number of choices in combat. You're free to pick from all of the units available in the entire series, light or dark. While you may be a bad guy, you have puppet rulers providing access to the good guys (well, corrupted versions of the good guys, like dark paladins and heretic priests). You field armies of zombies and spiky-heeled demon temptresses, giant spiders and snakes, knights and griffons, assassins and pirates, and so forth. You can mix and match, although attack skills, special abilities, and the ability to make ranged assaults are always more important than alignment. I generally went evil whenever I could, both for the novelty of it and due to personal preference. Mostly, I couldn't get enough of the demons, especially the imps with their useful fireballs and clopping kung-fu-kick melee attacks."", ""Your hero isn't just a figurehead, either. While he doesn't personally enter the fray on the field of battle, he plays a huge role through special abilities and casting spells. Hero progression is a big part of the game as well. Experience points from battles go into leveling up, which increases core abilities like the attack-powering rage and the magic-powering mana. You also earn and collect might, mind, and magic runes that are used to purchase various arcane talents on extensive skill trees. This allows a considerable amount of customization during the campaign. Runes always seem to be in short supply, forcing some tough choices regarding when you're going to spend them on upgrades, and how you might spend them. I went all-in for magic, given how much offensive spells were turning the tide in battles."", 'Quests are as detailed as the landscape, with intricate plot points, plenteous dialogue from non-player characters, and multiple steps that make it seem as if you are playing a proper role-playing game instead of a tactical game with a dash of RPG flavor.', ""Allies are also gained over the course of the game. You acquire associates through various evil deeds and by corrupting the innocent. And you also acquire the assistance of a demonic familiar called Blackie (thankfully, this guy you can rename), who can whip out devastating magical attacks during combat based on the amount of rage you currently have in stock. He gains experience along the way as well, opening up new abilities and enhancing current ones. Some are almost overpowering. His orc strike, which drops a magical weapon on the head of a single enemy, does spectacular damage, and the black hole can take out a gang of tightly packed foes. Blackie functions similarly to that of the pet dragon in King's Bounty: Armored Princess, but with added evil."", ""Vibrant artistry is another part of the appeal. Dark Side is somewhat dated in appearance, and the translation problems give the game some of its budget-game aura, but it has the classic allure of comic-styled fantasy art that goes back to the Erol Otis covers of D&D modules in the '70s. Monster art is colorful and cartoony, but it works in this setting, and little added touches ensure that these scenes are not static. Lots of 3D background effects on both the main map and the battle screens give the game a lively look."", ""The music is even more impressive, and includes everything from operatic choruses to more stereotypical classical tunes, including one piece that sounds like a riff on one of the more memorable sections of The Moody Blues' Days of Future Passed. Sound effects are also fitting. Most have been reused from previous King's Bounty games, although the distinctive giggles, gasps, and grunts from creatures continue to give them personality and make every battle sound a little bit different from the last."", ""King's Bounty: Dark Side broadens the formula that has powered this franchise since the beginning with a gothic storyline, an extensive number of quests, and a ton of troops that can be used in countless ways on the field of combat. This is one of those cases where familiarity and excellence peacefully coexist, and that approach tends to work well whether you're singing about vanished rock stars or gaming with creatures of the night.""]"Miguel Concepcion,24-Jul-14,Dark Souls II Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dark-souls-ii-crown-of-the-sunken-king-review/1900-6415824/,8,PS3 & Xbox 360,"[""The road to the emotional rewards of the Souls games is strewn with sweat-stained controllers and saintly patience. The franchise as a whole is a long-term trust game, where any given boss shoves you to the precipice of capitulation, but never lets you go over the edge. I can't imagine that achieving this balance over and over again is an easy task for developer From Software, and there's a part of me that often fears I'm only one encounter away from giving up on the series. To its credit, that fear was pervasive during my playthrough of Crown of the Sunken King, the first of three content packs for Dark Souls II."", ""If you approach downloadable campaigns with a level of cynicism, take pleasure in knowing that Crown of the Sunken King does not feel like previously made content that was withheld for a cash grab. Its interconnected levels echo the woven layout of the first Dark Souls without feeling like a full-on throwback. You experience the tension of cautiously venturing along an unexplored path, only to realize that, much to your relief, you've stumbled upon a new shortcut to an old bonfire."", ""From Software builds on this positive sense of exploration with sets of environmental puzzles, some of which alter the shape of the landscape itself, letting you access new areas or attain items that are seemingly beyond reach. Once you learn that one puzzle leads you to unique treasure, the compulsion to solve every puzzle hits you like a broadsword. This encourages a level of thought and experimentation that Dark Souls II lacked. Ever the sadist studio, From Software uses this opportunity to subject you to new platforming challenges, as if to say, Just one more thing... Your dexterity is tested as often as your brain is, and in ways for which the main game provides little to no preparation. Crown of the Sunken King also differs from Dark Souls II stylistically. I relished in the dramatic reveal of a temple upon exiting the first cave in Shulva, Sanctum City. Held up against the European aesthetics of castles in Dark Souls II, the temple's Aztec influence is difficult to ignore, yet given the series' otherworldly look overall, the contrast is neither jarring nor off-putting."", ""Crown of the Sunken King is difficult and assumes you've made substantial progress in the main game. By placing its initial access point in Black Gulch, the add-on assumes you are conditioned for the trials of Shulva, Dragon's Sanctum, and Dragon's Rest. Given the series' infamy for its lack of hand-holding in the interest of personal discovery, I strongly advise you to explore a few other areas in the main game before venturing into these new lands. If you still question the add-on's high difficulty, wait until you meet the cousins of the poison statues from Black Gulch. That's assuming you haven't fallen into the game's myriad pits first."", ""If you recall the dark and often unsettling areas that lead to Black Gulch, then you won't be surprised at the equally dreary locales in Crown of the Sunken King. This DLC introduces the grotesque insects known as the corrosive egg crawlers, whose bulbous silhouettes seldom fail to induce goose bumps if encountered in a poorly lit hallway. It's no wonder many Souls fans classify the series as survival horror."", 'The underlying weapon in this series has always been knowledge. Pairing that with awareness of your surroundings makes for a lethal combination. Much like in the rest of the series, combat in Crown of the Sunken King is at its most rewarding when you have the presence of mind to use your environment to your benefit. I would bear no shame in luring a couple of sanctum knights away from a narrow cliff ledge and onto a wide and flat arena-style platform if I felt it gave me an advantage. Yet sometimes, you just have to die to learn how each new opponent behaves. This was the case when I took on a pair of dragons and learned the hard way that it was in my best interest to separate them.', ""Your tactics against the bosses depend on how much Dark Souls II you've played up to this point. Crown of the Sunken King is guilty of having bosses who occasionally behave like reskins of other characters. Sinh closely resembles the ancient dragon, while Queen Elana could be mistaken for a sister of Queen Nashandra. The only boss encounter that has any semblance of originality is against a trio of human-size non-player characters. When you're dealing with three enemies, each with a different weapon skill, no two battles are alike. Your only hope is to make sense of the chaos and presume that each life you lose yields more knowledge of your enemies' moves and openings."", ""Dark Souls games demand two levels of patience: the kind born out of enduring a soul-crushing string of deaths and the kind of patience needed during actual combat. When considering the latter, I'm often inspired by the underappreciated Bushido Blade. Waiting for the opponent to move first and responding with an efficient, offensive reaction is often the best approach in any Souls game, and this is especially the case in Crown of the Sunken King. Much like the evil doppelgangers you've encountered in countless other games, a couple of knights in this DLC have movesets that are not unlike your own."", 'Dark Souls II by itself is so rich and robust in its challenges that I still feel the afterglow of having beaten it months ago. Yet that also comes with psychological scabs from the dozen replayed battles against the likes of the poison rat king and the smelter demon. As I began my eight-hour playthrough of Crown of the Sunken King, a line from The Shawshank Redemption echoed in my head: ""And if you\'ve come this far, maybe you\'re willing to come a little further."" I was willing and, with every Souls playthrough to date, I have been rewarded accordingly. Crown of the Sunken King\'s standout exploratory design and abundance of engaging enemy encounters make it a terrific adventure, though a hair short of being essential. Equally significant is that it succeeds at raising the stakes for the next installment.']"Daniel Hindes,24-Jul-14,Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/oddworld-new-n-tasty-review/1900-6415825/,8,PS4,"[""Dried blood cakes the catwalks of RuptureFarms, the biggest meat processing plant on Oddworld. Gangly, emaciated Mudokon slaves scrub the factory's floors with dirty rags. Sadistic, squid-faced slig guards let off steam by beating the workers with the butts of their rifles and laughing at their cries of pain, while overhead conveyer belts cart seemingly endless barrels of processed meat to destinations unknown. Despite the harrowing conditions, one blue-skinned Mudokon slave named Abe still thinks he has a pretty good job. But after stumbling upon RuptureFarms' plans for a tasty new product, Abe abandons his cleaning duties and sets out to escape the slaughterhouse."", ""So begins Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty, a remake of 1997's side-scrolling platformer Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee. But this remake doesn't simply scale up the original game's prerendered, 2D visuals to 1080p; it presents the same levels and puzzles, but rebuilt from the ground up in real-time 3D. This changes your window into Oddworld itself. While Abe's Oddysee divided its levels into still screens that used transition effects when travelling between them, New 'n' Tasty features a camera that scrolls with Abe as he walks, runs, and sneaks through Oddworld. Though this is nothing new for games today, it's still a thrill to see areas from Abe's Oddysee that would have required travelling across seven or so screens rendered in New 'n' Tasty with an impressive seamlessness. The camera is also free to close in for tight shots, tilt and pan for cinematic effect, and pull out to reveal more oncoming obstacles in tense chase sequences. This allows you to get a better look at the consistently gorgeous environmental design, which has lost none of the original game's style and detail in the move to 3D. For me, it felt like New 'n' Tasty presented a literal depiction of Oddworld as my mind's eye saw it in 1997."", ""Despite the brand new visuals, New 'n' Tasty takes great care to retain the core side-scrolling platforming that distinguished Abe's Oddysee 17 years ago, and still makes for a unique game today. Abe is a weakling, being extremely fragile and lacking in offensive capabilities. He is more concerned with surviving his enemies than destroying them, and does this by sneaking past them, outrunning them, or turning the environment on them when possible. Abe can hide in steam vents, lead gun-toting guards into land mines, zap them by activating electric fields, and occasionally possess a guard to temporarily make him turn his gun on his comrades."", ""New 'n' Tasty takes great care to retain the core side-scrolling platforming that distinguished Abe's Oddysee 17 years ago."", ""Abe's enemies are always scarier and more powerful than he is, in ways that give each of Oddworld's creatures distinct behaviours and identities. Possessing a slig allows you to issue basic commands to Slogs--small dog-like creatures--even going so far as being able to order them to kill another slig. Spider-like paramites won't attack unless backed into a corner, whilst predatory scrabs will attack on sight unless they see another scrab, upon which the two will fight to the death. Exploiting these behaviours is the key to solving most puzzles, and the behaviours themselves mix well with environmental hazards in ways that never feel repetitive."", ""Once he makes it out of RuptureFarms, Abe discovers his quest isn't solely about self-preservation. He needs to acquire two mystical hand scars that contain the power to shut down the slaughterhouse. Along the way, he must free his enslaved Mudokon brothers by issuing them basic commands and leading them to portals. For all the traumatic ways Abe can die in this hostile world, there's a certain slapstick quality to the proceedings when you have three Mudokons in tow who are just as frail. They aren't the brightest of brethren, so you need to tell them to follow you, and occasionally wait, lest they walk straight into a land mine or electric field before you clear the way. The variety of voices in New 'n' Tasty, and actual lines of dialogue, have been greatly increased over the original, so the Mudokons feel less like carbon copies of one another. The addition of rag-doll physics in this remake pushes the dichotomy between the dark subject matter and comedic attempts to survive even further than the original game. I laughed, and felt a little bit bad about it."", 'Trying to survive as a fragile character like Abe was something of a novelty when Abe\'s Oddysee was first released; he died in one hit, but had unlimited lives. The same is true of New \'n\' Tasty, but this remake adds three difficulty levels, the easier of which allows you to take more than one hit before dying. But even the hardest, ""classic"" difficulty level is still forgiving, thanks to the addition of a quicksave feature--something introduced in the original game\'s sequel, Oddworld: Abe\'s Exoddus. Quicksaving in New \'n\' Tasty is accomplished by tapping the PlayStation 4 controller\'s touchpad, and quickloading is done by holding the touchpad down for a second. It\'s an easy, intuitive system, and if you keep it in mind it\'s unlikely you\'ll lose more than a second of progress upon what are sure to be many repeated deaths.', ""Unfortunately, many of those deaths are likely to occur because of the way New 'n' Tasty's control scheme differs from Abe's Oddysee's. The original game was released before the first DualShock controller, so you altered Abe's movement speed by holding down the shoulder buttons. This fine, digital control was important, as the game required precise timing of sprints and jumps to avoid landing on mines or falling down chasms. New 'n' Tasty changes this by putting two movement speeds on the left thumbstick; pushing it slightly makes Abe walk, while pushing it harder makes him run. This led to a number of situations where I had to adjust my position by a single step, but ended up running straight into a land mine. Thankfully, sneaking is still bound to a shoulder button, so it's rare that you'll accidentally wake up a guard and get shot due to this new analogue movement system."", ""Perhaps the oddest thing about this remake is the presence of in-game advertising. For a game that is staunchly anti-capitalism, as evidenced by the snarky critiques that appear on in-game billboards, it seems contradictory for those billboards to then scroll to reveal a poster for an upcoming PS4 game. More harmful is that those ads contain depictions of human characters, violating the otherwise consistently odd nature of the game's fauna. Though rarely seen, these ads still took me out of the experience in an awkward, fourth-wall-breaking fashion."", ""Despite the ads, and occasional frustrations from the fiddly analogue movement, this is a remake that feels as though it was crafted with love and respect. With clever puzzles near identical to the original game, and beautiful environments brought to life with new visuals and a dynamic camera, New 'n' Tasty satiated me, even though I'm an Oddworld veteran and know each solution and secret area like the back of my (scarred) hand.""]"Daniel Starkey,22-Jul-14,Super Comboman Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/super-comboman-review/1900-6415823/,3,PC,"[""At first glance, Super Comboman looks like the kind of average action platformer that overwhelms Steam's front page. But it isn't. Rather, it's bad, and sometimes amazingly so. Nearly every success is met with an equivalent failure, and that leads to a cycle of hope and despair that perfectly encapsulates the Super Comboman experience. The art style is charming enough, as the game makes all of its characters and environments look like cute stickers, but the animations often fail to load, leading to visual clutter and confusion. Some of the music is amazing, but it wears on you when it loops every 30 seconds or so. And perhaps most damning, Super Comboman occasionally makes you feel incredibly powerful before doling out some excruciating forearm cramps."", ""The strange, almost dualistic nature of Super Comboman is clear from the outset. The star is Struggles, an out-of-work comic book geek desperate for some cash to help with his mortgage. To make a bit of money, he sets off with his sentient fanny pack in the hopes that he can one day learn how to fight as well as his hero, the eponymous Super Comboman. Immediately, there's an awkward clash between heavy poignancy and camp that ultimately drifts off into a nonstop barrage of groan-inducing Internet memes."", ""After that introduction, you're thrust straight into the heat of combat and taught how to string together attacks and combo like a pro. At first, you have a few basic moves, such as light and heavy attacks. For the most part, these are functional and help you juggle foes or slam them through a brick wall, but when the action gets going, the cracks in the foundation become too big not to notice. Even under the best circumstances, you can only ever attack in one or two directions, though you often have foes attacking from several elevations in addition to being in front of or behind you. Escape is tough, because it opens you up to other attacks, which can put you in an animation cycle that ends only when you die."", ""Guarding can help, sometimes, but more often than not enemies just wear you down and kill you. Your only recourse is to parry attacks, which is done by tapping forward. Even that comes at a cost, namely your stamina. With most incoming attacks, a small bubble appears that alerts you to a parry, or at least that's how it's supposed to work. Sometimes there is so much happening onscreen that you just blindly tap forward so you can parry any incoming attack and avoid nasty animation locks. That's fine for a while, but it doesn't take long for that tactic to get exhausting. Add that to the constant flurry of attacks, blocks, and dashes that you perform, and on some levels, your forearms will be cramping inside of 10 minutes."", ""If you can defeat enough foes, you steadily earn a bit of cash, which you can spend on more-advanced attacks that are supposed to help rack up damage a bit more quickly, but they're really tough to pull off thanks to input lag. Every once in a while, everything lines up just right, and you can perform really slick combos that feel amazing, but those moments are far too rare and end all too quickly. In a game like this, boss fights should be a full test of everything you've learned up to that stage--tough, but ultimately empowering. Instead, I found that the best option was simply to double-jump in, use one attack, and then jump back out before I took a hit. The bigger, fancier moves Super Comboman tries to encourage are especially risky when facing off against a particular baddy that can knock away half your health with one good shot. Ultimately, combat is far and away more aggravating than fun."", 'Combos also bring up a smooth-voiced announcer that says things like ""Noobtastic,"" ""Scrubtacular,"" and ""Smizzle"" when you\'ve performed combos that exceed five, 10, and 20 hits respectively. While the exclamations warrant little more than a dry smirk the first time, given that the game is based on performing combos as many times as humanly possible, the constant audio feedback quickly becomes mind-numbingly obnoxious. It\'s also representative of the kind of grating humor that pervades the entire game. Some of it can be offensive, depending on your sensibilities. I recall one enemy that\'s meant to represent homeless men, and after he attacked by flashing his penis offscreen, I couldn\'t help but think Super Comboman was presenting and reinforcing some of the worst stereotypes of the homeless with a touch of snarky homophobia. That crass and sophomoric humor runs throughout and is usually a miss.', 'Nearly every success is met with an equivalent failure, and that leads to a cycle of hope and despair that perfectly encapsulates the Super Comboman experience.', ""Platforming is just as awful. Super Comboman often transitions from large open areas to cramped vertical segments. To manage the transitions, the designers opted for long vertical tubes that rely on several successful wall-jumps in quick succession. What makes that problematic, though, is that the wall-jumping here is terrible and without qualification the worst I've ever seen in any game. Wall-jumps are typically difficult maneuvers, sure, but game designers have found many ways to make them simple enough to be doable for average players. Mega Man X lets you slide gently down and jump at your leisure, while the Metroid series requires you to properly time only a few button presses and automates the rest."", ""Super Comboman gives you no such help. You need to jump toward a wall and then quickly switch to moving out and away. The problem here is twofold. With the game's input lag, it's almost impossible to get that timing right consistently, and without a system like that of Mega Man X, where the game gives you a larger window to make that jump, platforming comes off as ludicrously frustrating. It's made much worse in some timed segments where obstacles and enemies are placed in front of you, and failure means an instant death. That is punishingly, brutally hard for absolutely no reason. After several runs, I found no consistent pattern for what let me succeed and what caused me to fail. Sometimes the enemies would lock me in one of those animation loops and I'd be dead before I could react. At other times I seemed to do everything wrong and still make it through. With levels like this, Super Comboman made me feel like my success was arbitrary and completely divorced not only from my actual level of skill, but also from what I'd managed to learn and ultimately apply within the game."", ""Super Comboman is severely flawed, but buried beneath controller-snapping frustration is a game that with some control tweaks, less lag, and some bug fixes could have been enjoyable. Sadly, in addition to its numerous deficiencies, it is riddled with annoying bugs that keep the camera from focusing on you or that prevent your character sprite from loading at all, though to the developer's credit, patches have been frequent. Nonetheless, Super Comboman is still a frustrating mess that's more likely to cause wrist injuries than it is to inspire cries of platforming joy.""]"Cameron Woolsey,22-Jul-14,Unrest Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/unrest-review/1900-6415822/,6,PC,"['In many games where conversational choices dictate plot progression, success is often guided by a system of modern Western morality. Choosing the noble response sends you on a path toward ""good,"" while the opposite is clearly ""bad."" Sometimes there is a moral gray area, but ultimately, the games are typically designed around the binary concept of good and evil. Unrest, however, steps away from such tradition. Challenging the ancient and uncompromising social barriers of Unrest can yield dire consequences: putting your family in peril, shaking a community apart, or much worse. While Unrest struggles to stay consistent in its message, the lives of its damaged, refreshingly human characters stayed in my mind for many days after the credits rolled.', ""Against the backdrop of an ancient India rooted in both myth and history, you guide several people as they struggle to survive in Bhimra. Once a thriving city, previously considered the mightiest of all, Bhimra is choked by drought and bridled by poverty, disease, and hatred. The game's unconventional cast members stand as grim reflections of Unrest's dismal world. This point-and-click adventure game is devoid of the cleft-chinned adventurer who approaches danger with a charming quip--or a crack of a whip, when charisma won't do the trick."", ""Instead, you play as individuals straddling the social divide of India's rigid caste system. They include a peasant girl, betrothed against her will; a priest who bows to new masters for the sake of his family; a mercenary captain, barely keeping the city from tearing itself apart; and a princess, fallen from grace, fighting for survival in the slums. The emotional impact of their stories hits deep. It's hard not to feel sympathy for a young girl whose world was once adorned with flowing drapes, clean clothes, and rich food. This same girl now finds herself filthy, starved on the streets, and standing over a mutilated corpse, contemplating whether she should walk away and save her dwindling pride, or soil her hands with the victim's blood in hopes that a pocket yields a mere crust of bread. Desperation is prevalent, and in Unrest, living to see another day is the greatest victory."", 'Most of your time is spent in conversations, where your replies shape your fate for good or ill, and discourse is rarely straightforward; Unrest is not a game that provides easy answers to complicated issues. Instead, you are rewarded for your ability to intelligently weave your way through conversations, suppressing any penchant for a brazen response. Yielding to the social laws is hardly virtuous, but it could keep you breathing.', ""In conversations, characters acknowledge you in three colored bars representing friendship, respect, and fear. That acknowledgment is important in choosing the right person to strike up a conversation with in order to pursue your goals. In one event, a town guard with little respect for your plight shows a comparable amount of empathy for your hunger pangs, refusing you access to a temple that hands out food. A guard in another story, however, can be coerced to step aside if you latch onto his fear and agree to help appease his crippling gambling debt. But not all characters welcome discourse. The reptilian naga, for example, are often blamed for Bhimra's condition, and therefore show no love toward humans. Most interactions with these creatures in the slums involve death threats."", ""In Unrest, failing in a storyline is worse than the end of a quest; it could mean the death of a character. You might believe that decisions you make are the correct ones--like I did many times. But Unrest is not like games such as Mass Effect or Dragon Age, and assuming the sensibilities of such games could leave you staring down an executioner's blade. As the story draws to a close, the game tells you how your character managed after leaving your care. My first experience in receiving this report card of my actions was a gut punch--despite my best efforts, my character didn't survive. What had I done wrong? I did everything that came natural to me, and so I assumed I would be kindly rewarded. Unrest's cold pragmatism was sobering, and such lessons linger as the game progresses."", 'Most of your time is spent in conversations, where your replies shape your fate for good or ill, and discourse is rarely straightforward.', ""Unrest requires much readiing, both in and out of conversations. In games with so much unvoiced conversation, reading several paragraphs with each character interaction comes with the territory. But the game also provides detailed profiles on the people the character knows personally, as well as descriptions and the history of items in your inventory. The game's own exposition, coupled with books and scrolls containing Bhimra lore, has you perusing pages and pages of information. It gets exhausting, and I found that I needed to take occasional breaks to rest my eyes and stave off boredom."", ""Unrest isn't free of concerns, the most damning of which is its tendency to hinder immersion. The vibrant hand-painted environments are far too cheerful for the theme. Bright splashes of colors and hand-illustrated designs are a jarring juxtaposition to Unrest's somber motif, and undercut the overall impact of the stark, poignant world. There are also technical issues, which range from crashing to desktop following one of Unrest's many loading screens to odd pathfinding problems in which characters oscillate along their path or get stuck on corners. During conversations, making choices drops the menu back to the gameplay screen for a split second, which is distracting to the point of aggravation."", 'In Unrest, failing in a storyline is worse than the end of a quest; it could mean the death of a character.', ""With different ways to approach situations, Unrest encourages multiple playthroughs. Unfortunately, in replaying the game, I found myself disappointed by how completed stories affect the overall plot. Unrest claims that characters, left alive or otherwise, blend naturally into the game's narrative after their tales are finished. However, only two individuals were ever mentioned, one of them just in a passing comment. In reality, the characters' plights and their impact on the plot are superficial, existing merely to give you the impression that their lives changed something."", ""But I found myself most disappointed in the game's central story. Out of the four playable characters, there is one whose placement in the narrative is an anomaly; she experiences the hardships of her world, but no matter your influence on it, you cannot alter her course. I had even tried replaying certain sections in an effort to sabotage the final sequence of events, choosing options that I felt could have affected her path, but to no avail. Unrest ultimately opts for what is almost a fairy-tale-like conclusion, which goes against the messages that paved the way."", 'At the end of her journey, the character ends up in a situation similar to the one that started it; the ending, uninspired, rang hollow. After I completed Unrest, I spent some time contemplating the circular logic behind the conclusion. I thought, perhaps, that the game was attempting to explain that no matter how hard we try to change our destinies, fate is carved in stone and impervious to our influence. But I could be searching for a deeper meaning where one doesn\'t exist. A quote by a character near the end of the game seems appropriate: ""When you get lost in a happy story, all the other details and consequences are nothing, and anything becomes possible.""', ""Despite the glaring issues, I was swept up by Unrest's unique cast, and I cared about their troubles, enough to even feel responsible if the path I led them down ended up in disaster. Though flawed, Unrest's system of cause and effect is a refreshing change from traditional conversation mechanics and deserves appreciation. In a sea of clearly defined morality systems, Unrest proves that sometimes the best waters consist of infinite shades of gray.""]"Brett Todd,22-Jul-14,The Walking Dead: Season Two - A Telltale Games Series Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-walking-dead-season-two-episode-four-amid-the-/1900-6415820/,9,Xbox 360 & PS3 & PC,"['After taking the grim death march that is season two of The Walking Dead to its moral nadir last time out with the option of gawking at every little detail of what a crowbar can do to a cranium, Telltale Games really goes all out with Amid the Ruins. This fourth and penultimate episode of the current season hit a sweet spot for me, sticking with the same doom-laden atmosphere but moving away from the pensive moments that made me feel somewhat like a spectator at times during its predecessors. Tighter plotting, constant zombie attacks, and the introduction of mysterious new human adversaries led to more action sequences and stark dialogue choices that put me right in the middle of this increasingly bleak apocalyptic world.', ""Glimmers of hope are as hard to find here as shafts of light in a coal mine. The story continues precisely where episode three, In Harm's Way, left off, with the increasingly mature Clementine and the surviving members of her band of buddies using zombie-guts camouflage to sneak through an undead herd besieging the box-store empire of villain Bill Carver. A brief, if brutal, moment of optimism at the end of the last episode turns horrific in short order, and that sets the tone for the rest of the unrelentingly depressing two hours or so needed to play through to (another) cliff-hanger conclusion."", ""Most of the plot plays out in a Civil War historical battle site (the fictional Parker's Run) cemetery and tourist visitor center where the survivors of the opening zombie race regroup. This setting is oddly apropos (even if the continued attention given to a statue of one soldier carrying another off the battlefield beats you over the head with the thesis that we all have to help one another in tough times), given the conflict developing between members of the group. Kenny is unfairly blaming Clementine. Luke gets slammed for taking part in an, um, entertaining interlude with Jane. Sarah is still a total mess who continues to aggravate everyone. And despite all of this, the group still has to work together to find a safe spot for the heavily pregnant Rebecca to deliver her baby."", 'The focus remains on Clem, largely due to a tremendous number of twitch action sequences where you have to dodge and kill zombies with button mashing. Zombies attack constantly, which is a refreshing change from prior episodes, where long stretches would go by without your having to do so much as respond to a question or shove a dresser in front of a door. In this episode, the whole gang is menaced, from the frenetic opening escape from Carver through to the zombie wave assault waged on the Civil War site gift shop just as Rebecca goes into labor.', ""Clementine also evolves as a person, but not in a particularly admirable way. Where the first three episodes in this season revealed more about how pragmatic--if not out and out cruel--the growing kid has to learn to be to survive in this new world, the story now moves well beyond the shocks of once-friendly dogs mauling you for a can of food and men being casually murdered for acts of kindness. Here, the brutal stuff becomes more prosaic. Before, these deaths were huge moments in the plot. Now, they're sort of just there, part of the everyday background noise that is a slice of everyone's life after the end of the world."", ""Some of this is because Clem is growing up. There is a brief but telling moment here when she gets stuck trying to sneak through a security gate and comments that she isn't as little as she used to be. Much of the casual acceptance of anything and everything nasty is also due to the influence of lone-wolf Jane. She can be a little too much of a one-note whiner, constantly harping about how helping other people just gets you killed. But as much as I came to sort of tune her out, Clementine didn't. The kid falls increasingly under the sway of Jane's Ayn Rand-ian tutorials, beginning with learning a sweep-the-leg zombie attack that would impress the guys from the Cobra Kai dojo."", ""What's more, Jane is proven right through the course of the game. No matter how much I chose the good-guy path in dialogue selections (which seem to have increased both in number and in the starkness of the choices they offer in comparison to the previous episodes), bad things kept on happening. Encouraging Jane to change her ways and start helping other people only succeeded in delaying the inevitable. Meaning that the person I was trying to save died anyway, but with the added benefit of putting other lives in jeopardy, too. This was finally hammered home toward the end of the episode. After I convinced Jane to take a huge chance on trying to save a helpless friend, I was given a prime seat at the table alongside a zombie buffet."", 'Reactions to these deaths (which are unavoidable no matter which dialogue choices you select, according to Telltale) are also becoming increasingly muted. The chowdown referred to above would have been a defining moment just last episode. Now it takes place and everyone moves on almost instantly. Granted, the gang is a little preoccupied with the birth of Rebecca\'s baby, and this death is one that has been telegraphed for a good long time now. But it\'s incredible how the group watches this horrifying scene and adopts a ""Well, that happened"" (a fitting line that Mike uses to describe an incident with a zombie earlier in the game) attitude, and then the next scene you see is Clementine and the others taking a nap.', ""With Amid the Ruins, there is no more room to be a spectator. While Clementine could often sit back and observe everything during the first episodes of this season as still something of a little kid, now she is an almost-grown-up soldier on the front lines of every zombie attack and every life-and-death situation determining the fates of her friends. Given a last-second surprise death and the fade-to-black gunfight, those fates are not likely to be good ones. Still, Telltale's masterful storytelling keeps us hoping for the best even as that optimism is continually shattered by what is proving to be one of the most memorable tragedies ever told in gaming.""]"Cameron Woolsey,21-Jul-14,Wayward Manor Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wayward-manor-review/1900-6415821/,4,PC,"[""Many of us desire peace in our twilight years. In Wayward Manor, the sentiment is equally true for an old, sentient house, which yearns for a tranquil retirement. This means that the boisterous family that lives there has to go, and it's your job as the manor's loyal poltergeist to move them out. Wayward Manor is a modest puzzle game, featuring plenty of good-natured charm and slapstick humor. But you're not the only one haunting the manor's creaking halls; an array of game-ending glitches provide more worriment than the game's dancing shadows, while the lack of challenge turn the second half into a snooze."", ""As the manor's sole guardian, you must move from room to room, scaring away the unwanted guests. You approach this goal by manipulating certain objects in a room marked with an eerie spectral glow. Using your paranormal abilities, you prey upon the family's deep-seated fears and anxieties, or frighten them with tactful snares, including mousetraps and a pirate ghost that slashes at them from a painting. You can rattle a stone bust, which grabs a victim's attention long enough for you to send a bottle flying toward her head, shaking her constitution. The sight of a rat sends the family maid into a panic, so why not have one scurry across her path, causing her to jump with fright? A successful scare rewards you with a green skull. The more skulls you earn, the stronger your presence in a room, allowing you to manipulate even more objects as you frighten the pants off various intruders. Once you collect six skulls, you activate a ghastly whirlwind that whips up loose objects, sending your hapless victim screaming out the door for good."", ""At first, there is a sense of discovery in solving Wayward Manor's puzzles, but the excitement dissipates more quickly than a specter in the sunlight. By the time you hit the third chapter, a cursory glance is all that is required to figure out each level's mystery. Gameplay stagnates, and there are only so many times you can whack one of the dopey characters on the head with a bottle before boredom seeps in. As you enter the game's third chapter, the lack of variety turns puzzle solving into more of a mechanical motion, over one that promotes the enjoyable analysis of the working parts. If you do find yourself at a loss, creatures such as cats, birds, and gargoyles located in the rooms offer advice on how to approach the puzzle."", ""The story is penned by Coraline author Neil Gaiman, and the game draws influences from the surreal book-turned-film. Narration is spoken in a storybook style, and Gaiman himself lends his smoky voice to the living manor during brief moments of exposition between chapters. Though the dated visuals of Wayward Manor won't win any awards, the game fully embraces its peculiar art style, which I found alluring. The multistoried manor is warped and cartoonish, yet still macabre, its dusty rooms lit by flickering candles or by azure moonlight creeping in through windows. The family inhabiting the manor is made up of diminutive caricatures exhibiting charming mannerisms, their voices replaced by the sounds of various musical instruments."", ' ', ""Unfortunately, I won't remember Wayward Manor for its interesting characters or art style, but for the menagerie of bugs and game-ending glitches that invoke far more tension than what my spectral hijinks could match. The most innocent of the issues include the whirlwind, which forces objects to clip through walls and people, and some occasional animation foibles, such as characters sprinting backward. Among the worst, however, is the surprisingly frequent gameplay bug that causes the puzzle and characters to freeze, unperturbed by my dismayed flurry of mouse clicks--there is nothing more to do than restart the level. In my playthrough of the game, I encountered the bug more than a dozen times. The final level was especially irritating, because a necessary puzzle piece refused to move into position, requiring me to restart about five times before the object finally clicked into place."", ""Wayward Manor, with its brevity and elementary one-button approach to gameplay, is not a complicated game. It's unfortunate, however, that the number of bugs infesting it make things so problematic and frustrating. The game's spooky ambiance and appealing nature are enjoyable, but not enough to overshadow the humdrum puzzle solving, nor to distract you from glitches. Wayward Manor puts a lot of trust in your abilities to remove unwanted guests, but it would have found equal success in calling pest control.""]"Matt Cabral,21-Jul-14,MouseCraft Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mousecraft-review/1900-6415818/,6,PlayStation Vita & PS3 & PS4 & PC,"[""MouseCraft mashes up the strategic brick layering of Tetris with the minion management of Lemmings. This is an appealing premise, and the game occasionally lives up to its promise, but long stretches of shallow puzzles keep it from achieving the greatness of the classics it's based on. Its pop-off-the-Vita visuals and brimming charm often overshadow its shortcomings, but MouseCraft ultimately comes off more cute than clever."", ""That's not necessarily a bad thing, though, because the game's abundance of adorableness kept me smiling even when its gameplay let me down. While the setup--help a trio of rodents get from point A to point B--sounds simple, the charming presentation sports more personality than most puzzlers. Decked out in Doc Brown designer wear--goofy goggles, lab coat, and argyle sweater--the protagonist is a mad scientist cat. The nutty feline professor isn't restricted to cutscenes, however; his animated antics are always on display in the background. It's a small touch, but seeing him dramatically react to his experiments in real time definitely added to my enjoyment. Subtler inclusions, from the stages' spinning hamster-wheel starting points to the visible waft hovering above the cheese, similarly had me flashing a goofy grin. And just when I thought I'd seen it all, I witnessed a mouse--in ghost form--gently drift up to the heavens upon being dipped in acid."", ""Speaking of untimely rodent deaths, MouseCraft is still a puzzle game. Using a set selection of Tetris-like blocks, you must carefully pick, rotate, and place the bricks to create safe passage for your mice. Only one of your furry friends must make it to the pungent prize, but a number of obstacles and hazards attempt to keep their coveted treat nibble-free. As you progress through the game's 80 levels--broken into four stages--you encounter enemy rats, pools of water and acid, and threats of the electrical variety. On the plus side, you also have some helpful tools at your disposal. In addition to obstacle-clearing bombs, you're awarded blocks that can significantly change the dynamic of your plan and path; jelly bricks, for example, cushion long falls, while indestructible blocks work exactly as advertised."", ""The cheese-chasing puzzles are at their brain-bending best when these various elements affect each other or when they present both life-saving and life-siphoning properties; mice can safely drop from a great distance into a pool of water, for example, but if they're left beneath the surface too long, they'll drown. MouseCraft does a decent job of introducing fresh ideas across its five or so hours of playtime, but it could have been better had it included more of these dynamic, double-edged-sword-like conundrums. As is, there are a few forgettable stretches where you breeze through a series of puzzles without giving your gray matter much of a workout."", 'Some additional challenge--and replay value--is injected via collectible shards. Not every one of the glowing blue objects needs to be grabbed, but enough must be acquired to access later levels. I rarely left the critical path to collect them, but found myself revisiting stages to accrue the requisite number. While devoted completionists will enjoy sniffing out every last one of these hard-to-reach items, others will appreciate the ability to quickly reset puzzles to their starting points, undo moves, and even freeze time. As someone who falls squarely in the middle of these two camps, I found the latter inclusion a little too helpful. I loved being able to pause the action to plot and plan my next move, without worrying about what trouble my mice were getting into, but at the same time, I found myself relying on this time-stopping power far too often. Perhaps putting a limit on its use per stage could have struck a happy medium between its being a strategic resource and an overused crutch.', ""MouseCraft also includes a level editor, allowing budding designers to build their own devious stages. Thanks to an intuitive interface and a brimming inventory of items and obstacles, this mode is fun and accessible. Sadly, its appeal is limited by the fact that you can't share your masterpieces online with other PS Vita-owning pals."", ""Forgoing the sort of melon-twisting substance that has seen many code-cracking gamers pull their hair out in favor of a pick-up-and-play puzzler with plenty of Pixar-flavored appeal, MouseCraft is usually a fun little romp.

It's true that Original Sin has the trappings of those memorable gems: an isometric camera perspective, an adventuring party of four, magic spells and pubs to relax in and an intriguing fantasy kingdom that captures the imagination. What makes this game so special, however, is that it avoids slavish devotion to those games of old and instead tells a tale very much its own--a tale of conflict between the elements that plays out in electrifying turn-based battles, and a real-world tale of loyalty, in which game and player establish a bond born out of patience, perseverance, and the promise of joyous surprises in every crevasse."", ""That Original Sin expects a certain amount of patience is obvious from its opening hours, during which you grow accustomed to the game's quiet confidence in your own intelligence and wits. As you traipse about the first town learning the ins and outs of the complex crafting and combat systems, you discover that there are genre conventions you must live without. There is no automated crafting interface that pieces together recipes you have learned; instead, you must remember those recipes or refer to your logbook. Waypoints are few, and quests rarely lead you directly to your ultimate destination. You do a lot of meandering in these early hours, which makes the pace drag, but this is your chance to explore, to test the waters, and to poke and prod at the game to discover what makes it tick."", 'In the process, you discover that Original Sin forces you to confront the consequences of your actions, and does so in ways that most RPGs boasting meaningful decisions fail to match. You cannot take every loaf of bread from an inn, or open any door you please, lest your actions lead to disapproval from the homeowner, or even the wrath of nearby guards. Such consequences appear in other RPGs, of course, but Original Sin goes even further, to the point where you must consider activities you would never question in most other games. In turn, you come to conduct yourself with an unusual level of care. In one instance, I dug up a grave within plain sight of a sobbing villager grieving her buried loved one. In a tear-fueled anger, the woman turned on me, a battle began, and I sliced her up with little fanfare. She was not a warrior, and no match for my party.', ""I mourned over this one simple action. Few role-playing games would have allowed this kind of conflict; they are designed to have you clicking on everything, seeking every possible gold medallion, every possible health potion. Games at large have taught me to presume there may be something valuable buried in graves and crypts, and those valuables are the journey's driving force in many (if not most) RPGs. Digging up this fresh grave rewarded me with a measly bone, a common crafting component I could easily have gone without. I had defiled a dead man's resting place and taken an innocent life because my greed was too great. I felt more guilty and more invested in this one action than I have felt in entire quest lines in other choice-driven role-playing games, and I chose not to reload an earlier save point. I forced myself to live with my decision."", 'And so you learn that every action has a reaction. This isn\'t Mass Effect or Dragon Age--your narrative path isn\'t determined by a good-or-bad morality system and branching conversations. Rather, you hew a path with every step, and the game responds naturally, allowing you to craft small but memorable stories like the one about the lady at the grave. You engage in plenty of dialogue, of course, much of it witty, much of it dramatic, and most of it colorfully written. There\'s a skeleton who misses having a soul, and whom you convince to replace his head. (It seems logical at the time.) There\'s a statue that promises to show you how your journey ends, and rolls the game\'s end credits should you ask to see your future. Developer Larian Studios takes Polonius\' words in Hamlet to heart: ""Brevity is the soul of wit."" The frequent conversations rarely get bogged down by endless and unnecessary dialogue, and conversation partners are drawn with broad, vibrant strokes. Some dialogue doesn\'t adjust properly to account for story events you have triggered (why are you talking about that necromancer as if you didn\'t know I murdered her?), but idiosyncrasies like that are minor distractions at worst.', ""You read more than just the onscreen dialogue. You must peruse recipe books if you want to learn how make a club out of a piece of wood and a handful of nails, or how to write a magic scroll. You craft items by dropping and dragging objects onto each other directly in your inventory window, or perhaps by dragging items onto a nearby furnace, mobile kitchen, or other gadget. You spend a lot of time in your inventory windows, which proves rather cumbersome after a while. But it's hard to contain yourself in that special moment when you create a magical starfish by accident--a moment outmatched by the one in which figure out what, exactly, you can do with that magical starfish."", 'What a wonderful place this is to be, overflowing with visual details and unexpected occurrences that make exploration a treat. There are blizzards and dust storms to trudge through, with each weather phenomenon ensuring that you rethink how to play. (The sandy winds slow me down in battle; how, then, must I compensate? I keep slipping in the ice; I wonder if these snowboots I found could prove useful?) There are spider-worshippers and cultists and an otherworldly place to call home, where you can bring on new hirelings and stash excess junk for safekeeping. Every discovery is a thrill, not just because there are so many sights to drink in and fill up on, but because some discoveries might lead to unplanned quest developments. For instance, if you are fortunate enough to have a party member who has earned the pet pal perk, a talking rabbit might have some excellent advice that allows you to bypass a perilous cavern--advice that has you again rethinking hitherto mundane game mechanics.', ""Depending on how you spend the skill points you earn as you level up, you might be able to talk your way out of conflict by charming, intimidating, or reasoning with potential adversaries. You wouldn't think that simple chats could be so dramatic as those in Original Sin, but the game uses a straightforward but effective rock-paper-scissors minigame to turn vital conversations into a suspenseful duel of words. The higher your rating in a particular conversation style, the closer you come to winning the verbal war with every rock-paper-scissors victory. My stress levels ran high when talks came down to one final game of chance. If I win, I can walk around the encampment freely; if I lose, I must shed the blood of the opposition. And if blood must be shed, I might never know what information or stories my victims might have otherwise shared."", ""But it's hard to contain yourself in that special moment when you create a magical starfish by accident--a moment outmatched by the one in which figure out what, exactly, you can do with that magical starfish."", ""Intriguingly, your two primary party members--the ones you customize within moments of booting up the game--may not agree with each other on a proper course of action. When playing with a cooperative partner, this means both players have an opportunity to direct the outcome. When playing on your own, this allows you to role-play both of these characters, a circumstance that led me to an experience I don't recall having had in any role-playing game before now. I had decided my man at arms had the soul of a paladin, always yearning to support the downtrodden uphold the moral high ground no matter the cost. My witch, on the other hand, was both more practical and more adventurous in my mind, always trying to stir the pot unless the aftermath were potentially too disastrous. When the two exchanged tough words, I chose options that seemed consistent with their characters, while secretly rooting for one or the other to overcome. I was playing both roles simultaneously, rather than just outright choosing the outcome I wanted. Plenty of RPGs feature adventuring parties; few actually encourage you to play two independent roles at once. "", ""Conversations can and do go awry; luckily, the tense and thoughtful battles are incredibly rewarding in their own right. The moment you engage your enemies, time pauses and combatants enter battle stance. From here, your party members perform whatever actions you command of them until you use up their action points or end their turn. Party members begin the game with very specific types skills, but Original Sin's great flexibility means that your adventurers might be able to fling all kinds of spells and swing all kinds of weapons. And while you don't want to sacrifice mastery for flexibility, having a lot of different types of attacks to choose from is highly advantageous, for battles are not just a clash of wills, but a clash of elements as well."", 'Elements are a vital aspect of video game sorcery; fireballs, ice shards, tornadoes, and the such have long held central magical roles in fantasy fiction. In Divinity: Original Sin, those elements cooperate and collide with each other, opening up all manner of satisfying offensive possibilities. You can make it rain, and then zap puddles with electricity, stunning the orcs unfortunate enough to be standing in them. You can ignite poisonous clouds and slicks of oil, thus bringing a band of creepy-crawlies to a smoldering end. Barrels of water and oil can provide a bit of battlefield assistance should they be scattered about, but be careful: not only can your opponents turn the tables, but you can inadvertently injure or even destroy your own party members if you get careless when zapping puddles and spewing poison.', 'Battle is not just about maximizing damage, however, and elements are not just for hurting and healing, but also for hindering. I won a nail-biting struggle with four colossal guardians by carefully controlling their speed and their strength. Turn by turn, I blinded, stunned, froze, weakened, and crippled these iron giants, doing my best to keep every character alive and taking down one guardian at a time until all four had fallen. Every time one of them marched towards my party, I held my breath. They could kill my mages with a single swipe, and their slow gait was pure agony. This is turn-based combat at its best. Every attack is meaningful, every option is a consideration, and every new enemy has you rethinking your strategy.', ""Divinity: Original Sin's minor flaws include a few bugs here and there, such as one that might turn a cave into a neverending mass of explosions. Its interface is fiddly, giving each party member his or her own supply of gold and sometimes making it a chore to do things as simple as repairing equipment or bartering with townspeople. Some idiosyncrasies aren't flaws, however, but rather reminders of how often we expect games to ask of us the simplest questions and then provide us easy answers. How do you find the forest where the White Witch lives? You go out into the world and you find it. How do you locate all the door-opening switches in an immense library? You look for them, you investigate, you open your eyes wide and truly take in the space around you. Little by little, you learn the rules--and little by little, you wonder why there are so few games so willing to trust you to examine and explore. That it believes in you is Original Sin's greatest achievement, and given its many achievements, that's high praise indeed.""]"Britton Peele,16-Jul-14,Infinity Runner Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/infinity-runner-review/1900-6415817/,5,PC,"['When you hear that Infinity Runner features werewolves in space, you might get excited by the goofy possibilities. But when you discover that Infinity Runner is a first-person Temple Run clone with a sci-fi setting, only it\'s not as good as that free-to-play smash hit, you would be forgiven if your excitement dropped drastically. This may be a reductive way to describe the game, but Infinity Runner is such a prototypical ""runner"" that it can\'t escape being compared to the many similar games that precede it.', ""Infinity Runner focuses on one thing only: running. That action is automatic, and you constantly move forward at a set speed whether you like it or not. Along the way, you encounter obstacles that you need to jump over, slide under, or strafe to the left or right of. There are only a handful of these obstacles throughout the game, so memorizing each is the key to success. For example, some corridors have lasers you have to leap over, while certain rooms have falling obstacles you must slide under. Some of these set pieces are appropriately dramatic when you first experience them, and when you tackle them correctly, there is an almost cinematic quality to the few seconds you spend sliding under an explosion or leaping over a collapsing bridge. But that feeling doesn't last, and you see each of these moments far too often for them to remain special. Jumping over a collapsing bridge in space looks cool once, but it gets silly if you see the exact same collapse twice more within minutes."", 'One of the more awkward aspects of the moment-to-moment gameplay is turning--something you do more often than anything else. As you approach a corner or intersection, you have to turn; otherwise, you crash into the wall. Since you automatically run in a straight line at all times, turning around corners is accomplished by looking in the direction you want to turn, either right or left. While easy from a gameplay perspective, it neither looks nor feels natural.', ""Sometimes you encounter enemies that you fight rather than dodge. The action slows to a crawl as you are presented with a quick-time event, hitting buttons as prompts appear on the screen before the timer runs out. These sorts of events are rarely the shining moments of any game, but Infinity Runner's are particularly punishing: miss a button (or hit the wrong button by mistake), and you immediately die. You get used to the punishment, and even enjoy the superficial fun. As the action speeds up and you get into a rhythm, running can be enjoyable if rote. But Infinity Runner's biggest problem isn't its lack of obstacle variety or progression. It's not that every path is a straight line and none of the scenery is very interesting (much less graphically impressive). It's that many instances aren't challenging; they're simply unfair."", 'Jumping over a collapsing bridge in space looks cool once, but it gets silly if you see the exact same collapse twice more within minutes.', ""On a couple of occasions, for instance, I came out of the game's werewolf mode (a form of near invincibility that is accessed with a power-up) to encounter an obstacle that was impossible to avoid due to the timing required and the lack of control I had as the transformation took place. The game's wall-run sections also cause much grief, because the in-game tutorial is not good at explaining the timing or even the button order necessary to pull them off."", ""Oddly enough, were it not for these frustrations, Infinity Runner would be too easy. Too often you end up automatically running through a set of empty rooms and corridors, occasionally turning around corners or dodging easy obstacles, and few set pieces present a worthwhile challenge. Several jumps require timing that's too tight, but many are too forgiving, which makes for an uneven and unsatisfying experience. You might run for seven minutes straight without breaking a sweat, only to lose a life in a corridor that's far more punishing than anything around it."", 'As you run, you must also collect data packets, which can be found in straight lines in many of the areas you dash through. Aside from contributing to your score, these do nothing, making them feel pointless and not worth the occasional risk they present. In similar games, such collectibles might be used as currency to buy items or upgrades, thus leading to higher scores in later runs. Here, there is never any carrot on a stick to aim for, unless you care about challenging yourself with high scores.', ""While Infinity Runner stays true to its name by providing an Infinite (that is, endless) running mode, it also has a story mode that is broken up into 14 stages across the game's seven environments. Infinity Runner's story mode feels like an attempt to stand out from the increasingly crowded subgenre of Temple Run clones, but instead of giving the game a boost of speed, it falls flat. It's unfortunate that a story involving werewolves in space can't be at least a little bit exciting, but the cliched plot ranges from uninteresting to bad. On occasion, it doesn't even make sense. For example, at the end of one level, you're attacked by a werewolf, and things look dire. When you begin the next level, however, you wake up somewhere else, perfectly fine, with no explanation."", 'Even if you find yourself caring about the story, prepare to be disappointed by its conclusion (or lack thereof). After bluntly alluding--repeatedly--to the fact that the only speaking character hasn\'t been entirely truthful with you, and providing multiple instances of a conversation being cut off before the truth can come out, the game ends by saying ""to be continued."" But if the planned sequel isn\'t drastically different from this game, I don\'t see much reason to pay more money when better running experiences can be had for cheaper prices.', ""The game also tries to do something a bit new with a 32-player competitive race mode, but even after the game's release on Steam, it's impossible to find an online match. The basics are exactly the same as in the single-player game, except that you race against other players for things like score or distance. The biggest change is that you can collect new power-ups that may hinder opposing players, such as one power-up that sends a werewolf to attack competitors and hopefully knock them back to an earlier checkpoint. This is an interesting idea, but without an online community, it remains untapped."", ""At its best, Infinity Runner is fine and functional. But it fails to successfully differentiate itself from other games of its type, many of which are cheaper, if not free. Story mode is an interesting idea, but it's over in a couple of hours or less and isn't a satisfying journey. It's a shame, but Infinity Runner trips over itself too often to pick up any speed.""]"Josiah Renaudin,9-Jul-14,Sniper Elite III Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sniper-elite-iii-review/1900-6415816/,6,PS4,"[""Whenever I wasn't setting up a shot, emptying my lungs, and pumping a sharp metal bullet through the thick skull of an unsuspecting enemy soldier, I was frustrated with Sniper Elite III. Not because the surrounding mechanics are broken or the levels are poorly structured, as the subsidiary elements of this third-person shooter are, for the most part, serviceable. However, every action building up to you actually pulling the trigger of a rifle feels more like a chore than an interesting setup for the perfect shot. There's an undeniable satisfaction that stems from the glorious slow-motion kills that abound in Sniper Elite III, but missions tend to promote stealthy, silent takedowns rather than the grotesque headshots it does so well."", 'Fortunately, what the game does best is on full display early on. The level design in Sniper Elite III is more open than previous games in the series, often encouraging shots being fired from more than 300 meters away. Instead of funneling you down a straight path, each of the eight locations in the campaign presents you with a sniping sandbox where creativity leads to better shooting and stronger positioning. Bullishly rushing headfirst into enemy territory is always an option, but the grizzled protagonist crumples to the dirt after just a pair of well-placed shots. Silent steps often lead to better vantage points, and with so many routes to choose from in any given level, the method by which the objective is completed is up to you.', ""That doesn't make this an open-world game, though. There are various side objectives like shutting down search lights or sabotaging the enemy's explosives supply, but there's still a clear path to completion within every mission. An ever-present objective marker reminds you that just 200 meters away lies a folder of intel that could greatly benefit the Allied forces, and all you need to do to collect it is pick off whatever patrolling soldiers stand in the way."", ""You're not required to kill everything with a heartbeat in order to progress, but the innate satisfaction that comes with long-range marksmanship is almost too great to pass up. After perching atop a sniper nest and locating a viable target, you have the option of steadying your breath and adding an additional red reticle that illustrates exactly where your bullet will drop. Once you fire off that perfect shot, the camera ignores the man behind the rifle and instead follows the round as it leisurely approaches its mark. It's a remarkable scene that all but erases auxiliary threats, letting you enjoy the slow-motion mayhem. The crack of your barrel will likely alert anything with a heartbeat nearby, but in that very moment, all that matters is the journey of a single bullet."", ""The finale of the shot is pure, primal bliss. A quick X-ray view of a perfect kill shot often shows the lead splintering both ends of the skull, forcing bits of brain to escape from the newly opened flesh caverns. Eyes pop, lungs burst, and yes, testicles rupture as you pump round after round into the opposition. It's the feature attraction of the series, and it's better than ever. You kill hundreds of unsuspecting enemies in this manner, watching as formerly distinctive faces are violently torn beyond recognition. Turning off the drawn-out animations is an option, but this boorish display of bloody precision is a guilty pleasure."", ""Regrettably, you're more often faced with tedious stealth sections than the extended sniping segments that make the game so captivating. Levels are littered with soldiers who perk up as soon as you fire off a noisy round, and since you're about as flimsy as any single enemy on screen, clearing the map with a silenced pistol or a quick flip of the knife is often the most intelligent route to success. That's not to say that Sniper Elite III is overly challenging, however. If you take the time to spot and tag enemies before firing, you ensure that you have time to relocate to another vantage point immediately after taking your shot. The game rewards you for relocating successfully, though it's too easy to simply backpedal to an area that you've already cleared and then wait for enemies to cool off. If you prefer to stay put, puttering generators and the timely hum of planes flying overhead can mask the crash of your rifle, but these contrived elements aren't enough to fix the core problem that stifles the fun. Sniper Elite III shines when you're looking through the scope, but there are just too many situations throughout the campaign that encourage close-range monotony over the wildly entertaining sniping."", ""Slowly creeping from cover to cover to keep your heart rate down isn't exactly a thrill, but the locales you'll explore are at least more colorful and distinctive than what we've seen from the first two entries. The drab browns and grays have been replaced by the lush African theater, where beautiful lighting shines through bright green foliage and the jagged edges of sprawling mountains. It doesn't have the graphical pop that you expect from a current game, but Sniper Elite III still impresses with multihued vistas that appear to stretch for miles."", ""A handful of difficulty settings extends the life of an otherwise stunted campaign, which features one of the most forgettable World War II narratives in recent memory. The deadly serious dialogue and macho posturing aren't the right matches for the often laughably over-the-top death animations, but the story sequences are sparse enough to ignore. The best commentary will often come from a second player, as the cheers and jeers resulting from a brutal assassination are more interesting than anything an in-game character has to say. It's easy to bring a friend into any of the campaign missions for some backup, and while it can be cumbersome to coordinate shots without alerting the guards, adding a second sniper to the mix creates a whole new set of tactics to consider."", ""Regrettably, you're more often faced with tedious stealth sections than the extended sniping segments that make the game so captivating."", 'The co-op offerings extend to an asymmetrical mode called Overwatch, which acts as a wave-based alternative to the campaign. The bulk of the action revolves around spotting and downing as many enemies as possible before either supplies or health are depleted, and since shooting guys in the head is the draw of Sniper Elite III, this additional mode is worth a look. However, completing objectives and coordinating kills with a friend in the campaign is a much more interesting challenge than simply popping off as many rounds as your rifle will allow.', ""Competitive multiplayer is light on surprise and heavy on disheartening deaths. One of the most frustrating ways to die in any online shooter is a surprise sniper bullet to the head, since it's often a sudden end that makes you feel powerless. Those, by and large, are the only deaths you'll encounter here, and you can expect them early and often. Unique modes like Distance King and No Cross are a welcome change from your basic Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch, as both encourage long-distance shooting over up-close-and-personal encounters. Still, there's nothing within the competitive suite that demanded my attention for more than a round or two of play."", ""All of this is assuming you'll even be able to connect to an online game. Of the 30 or so times I tried to locate matches, I found my way into just three games. The other 27 times? I either failed to connect before the game even started, disconnected after a single spawn, or crashed to the PlayStation 4's dashboard. Sniper Elite III's multiplayer is unstable at best, with most of my playtime revealing a mostly broken experience."", ""I often found myself cursing the more frustrating elements of Sniper Elite III. Broken matchmaking, and half-baked stealth sequences shouldn't be this incessant in a series that's just reached its third outing. But it's almost too easy to forget all of these head-scratching issues when that bullet makes contact with someone's cranium. It's a shallow, crude pleasure, but the delightful disorder that's just around every corner is strong enough to overshadow an otherwise forgettable experience.""]"Brett Todd,8-Jul-14,War Thunder Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/war-thunder-review/1900-6415815/,8,PS4,"[""War Thunder plays like a big, brassy World War II movie that does everything but wave flags. The larger-than-life attitude of Gaijin Entertainment's online simulation of combat by air and by land during WWII makes it a sprawling epic. Dozens and dozens of planes and tanks from each of the five principal nations that fought it out for freedom or fascism in the 1930 and 1940s collide on every map in wild, cataclysmic battles that alternate between intimidating and exhilarating. Battle can become confusing thanks to the sheer number of options and some interface grief, but the intense, fast-paced combat and wide range of difficulty settings save the day just like the Duke did at Omaha Beach."", 'Despite its scope, War Thunder is simple when broken down to its basic elements. Most notably, the game is available as a completely free download. You can purchase in-game currency to buy vehicles and skill upgrades, but because you can earn those bonuses by simply playing the game, spending is not forced upon you. Combat comes in two distinct flavors. You either take to the skies in a fighter or a bomber, or you grind it out on the ground in an armored vehicle. Matches are huge affairs involving up to 32 players. Tens of thousands of players are online at just about any time of the day or night on servers across the globe, too, so those 32 slots per game fill up. Match types involve familiar goals like destroying enemy ground forces from the air or conquering control points on the ground with your tanks.', 'When it comes to air combat, a trio of game difficulty settings allows everyone from casual shooters to more hardcore simmers to get comfortable. You can play in the physics-lite Arcade Battles mode, move up to the more rigorous Realistic setting, or go all-out with the grueling Simulator option. Arcade is the easiest way to play, thanks to amenities like starting in mid-flight in aerial combat and offering unlimited ammo both in the air and on the ground. Realistic mode tosses in a more punishing physics model along with the need to take off and land when flying. And Simulator mode takes the game to true flight simulator territory, planting you in a cockpit (the third-person camera option isnt available here) and forcing your soaring feat of mechanical engineering to compete with the laws of Newtonian physics.', 'Most players are gravitating toward the Arcade mode, which is all about pure adrenaline. Plane physics are very forgiving, so you can soar into crazy climbs and stomach-dropping dives without fearing too much about causing a stall or tearing your wings off in mid-air. You can also get goofy with shooting and blast away without much concern about accuracy, as youve always got fresh rounds ready to load into the chamber (although reloading does take a few seconds, which can seem like an eternity in the middle of a battle). All of this lets you focus on pure attack and defense, whether youre scrapping with enemy fighters, strafing ground vehicles, or dropping bombs.', 'Things get more hardcore in the air with Realistic and Simulator, which move the game well into flight simulation territory. There you have to approach everything from a more tactical perspective. Physics are much more rigorous, which really underlines the differences between aircraft. This is particularly noticeable when you move up from the early-game 1930s biplanes like the Gladiator to the proper WW II fighters like the Hurricane and Spitfire. Attacks must be careful and measured. Get carried away with mid-air maneuvers and you can shear off your wings or stall out. Stalls can be pretty common here if youre concentrating more on keeping up with an enemy than you are on what you are demanding of your aircraft. Pulling out of stalls isnt easy, either, as this takes time that you generally dont have in the middle of a furball. The same patience must be adopted when firing. Since you have limited ammo, you have to line up shots and only pull that trigger when youve got a target dead to rights. Running dry at the wrong moment can ruin your day in a hurry.', 'Patience is also a factor when just trying to get a aerial combat match going in the Realistic and Simulator modes of play. Fewer players are taking part here, which can mean that just lining up a game can take a long time. You can regularly wait five minutes and more until an appropriate match is found--or give up and retreat back to Arcade, where the wait time is rarely more than 30 seconds. This is a shame, as these more authentic settings of course add whole new dimensions to gameplay. They also broaden your options, allowing you to dig into more maps and take on more realistic scenarios mimicking real WWII theaters of action. There are also unlockable missions taken straight from the actual war, like engagements during the Battle of Britain, that can be played at the different difficulty settings.', 'War Thunders tank combat is more generic, regardless of the difficulty setting. So are the tanks themselves. All of them zip around and turn more like dune buggies than Panzers, which levels the playing field between the Arcade, Realistic, and Simulator modes. Sure, they dont roll around as quickly (especially when trying to head up any sort of incline) or turn on a dime quite as easily in Realistic as opposed to Arcade, but the overall feel remains loose across the board. This has the benefit of making tank battles play more like casual shooters, which of course makes them easier to immediately get into than the aerial combat. All tanks are properly modeled when it comes to armor, as well. This lends a certain amount of tactical thinking to battles, as you cant just pound away on any exposed part of an enemy tank and expect to do damage. As a result, its a must to find cover and smart firing positions.', 'The intense, fast-paced combat and wide range of difficulty settings save the day just like the Duke did at Omaha Beach.', ""Controls are crisp when flying or driving. The PS4's controller is more than adequate, and only loses the thread in a few specific instances, such as when you're called upon to take out harassing enemy fighters while on bombing runs. Simulator mode also really tests your skills with the analog sticks across the board, as you need a light touch most of the time to avoid losing control of your aircraft. Just a slight mistake at a lower altitude can result in a nose-dive into the ground. Tanks can also feel too loose at higher speeds, leading to occasions where you don't feel in complete control. Moments like these increase the twitch factor and make aiming difficult in spots. You can switch to the controller touchpad whenever you want and both move and shoot like you are using the mouse-driven control scheme for the PC version of the game, but the touchpad's small size makes it nearly useless during combat."", ""While using the controller touchpad during battles isn't a smart idea, it comes in very handy when trying to navigate the game's menus. Since War Thunder has been developed for both PS4 and PC, both share the same interface, with everything geared to be accessed via mouse and keyboard. This poses more than a few challenges on the PS4, largely because there are so many menus and there is so much information crammed onto the screen that it's difficult to access features intuitively. The touchpad is a better option here, although it isn't ideal because it is too small to allow you to easily move the cursor where it needs to go."", 'Most of the interface is quite confusing, too. One of the best features about War Thunder is its upgrade paths for vehicles. Well over a hundred planes and tanks are included in the game, but they have to be unlocked by research and then purchased with the in-game Silver Lion currency, which can be earned during matches or purchased with real-world money. The same goes for improvements like more powerful cannons, engines, bullets, crew member skills, and so forth.', ""But little of this is explained in the beginning. You look to pick up something that's pretty straightforward, like powerhouse new ammo, then discover that you need to research and buy something else in order to finally equip it. It's also hard to figure out the rhyme and reason behind the structure of the in-game economy. Having both the main silver lion and the premium golden eagle currencies is bad enough, but then you toss in the related research points and the option to get bonuses on the above by purchasing a premium account, and you've got a needlessly convoluted system."", ""But even though the economy is more intricate than it should be, War Thunder scores big bonus points by not forcing players to spend money to compete. This is not one a freeware games that constantly pressures you to buy, buy, buy. All you get are post-mission reminders of how many more research points you could have earned just now if you had shelled out for a premium account. Although spending a few bucks helps on occasion, it isn't required for you to be competitive, as long as you've got the time and patience to indulge in some grinding. In-game accomplishments are frequently rewarded, allowing you to get on an upgrade path right from the very beginning and to keep going without spending a dime."", ""Inspiring music gets you into the game from the moment that the first menu screen loads up. All of the rousing choral odes and martial tunes trumpet away as if War Thunder were big-budget Hollywood blockbuster set during WWII. Visuals are occasionally striking, if not as consistently triumphant. Maps range across many theaters of war, from undulating waves to rolling green hills, and vehicle models are comprehensively drawn, although battles rage at such a speed and such a distance that you can't afford to take much time to admire the scenery. Since so many online games--especially those with this sort of scope hosting such a large number of players--sacrifice visual quality for speed and playability, it's nice to see that few corners were cut here."", ""War Thunder is a sprawling WWII simulation that you can lose yourself in due to its wide scope, intense combat, tremendous number of vehicles, casual and challenging difficulty settings, and extensive upgrade paths. Also, the game is constantly growing with the addition of new planes, tanks, and maps, and the promise of naval forces and more modes of play. While the initial learning curve is daunting, this is one of those games that opens up dramatically the more that you play it, so the time commitment is worthwhile whether you're a laidback dogfighter or a hardcore simmer.""]"Kevin VanOrd,8-Jul-14,The Wolf Among Us Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-wolf-among-us-episode-5-cry-wolf/1900-6415813/,6,PC,"['""So what if it wasn\'t the truth? It was true enough.""', 'This line came in the final moments of The Wolf Among Us\' concluding episode, called Cry Wolf and it was an appropriate proclamation given the episode\'s murky end. The mystery had been--well, I don\'t know if ""solved"" is the proper word, but the case was now closed and it was time to move on. It was time to reflect on what Bigby Wolf had learned, what his decisions had meant for Fabletown and its residents, whose fairy tale lives of the past had been torn apart by murder, prostitution, and social upheaval. It was time to consider that I might have done the right thing for the wrong reasons, or perhaps the wrong thing for the right reasons. I am still not sure which it was, and the game certainly isn\'t telling me.', 'I didn\'t feel all that hopeful. Instead, I was struck by a pervading nihilism as I learned even more information after already making life-changing decisions that affected multiple Fables. Had I done the right thing? Was there a ""right"" thing at all? It didn\'t seem so. The truth was now defined by its sliding scale. There was such a thing as ""true enough."" It was this nihilism that had Bigby--this loyal, gruff, impatient Bigby I\'d created through the choices I\'d made over the course of the series--lowering his head in shame. ""It doesn\'t matter what I do,"" he said. ""In the end, it\'s all the same shit it always was.""', ""In many ways, this nihilism is fitting for a series that clearly would have no happy ending. I'd confronted Ichabod Crane's lecherous ways in previous installments. I had torn a Fable's arm off, a decision I had to confront every time I glimpsed him out of the corner of my eye. And as it turns out, many Fables had turned to the Crooked Man for assistance when they felt their own leaders had let them down. I don't know that even a government led by Snow could turn this place around, a suspicion verified by a Cry Wolf scene that mirrored one from Episode 1, demonstrating the inhumanity of government bureaucracy. Fables weren't making good choices because there was no good choice to make, no path leading to freedom and happiness. No--I should never have entertained the notion that The Wolf Among Us would come to an easy conclusion."", 'Nevertheless, I had hoped for a finale that offered a bit more clarity and focus than Cry Wolf does. The episode\'s climax came to me not by way of a heart-pounding action sequence but rather a roomful of Fables yelling over each other, trying to sway me to make one choice over another. The scene plays out for more time than seems necessary, and is more focused on reminding you of various choices you\'d made over the course of the series than it is on revealing anything new or important. ""Hey, remember that thing you did two episodes ago? We\'re going to refer to it now,"" Cry Wolf seems to say, pointing out that all those choices were just switches you flipped and variables you gave values to. ""Hey, remember that character? He doesn\'t seem to really belong in this scene, but we wanted to remind you he existed.""', ""The action still heats up, however, particularly in an excellent sequence that has you taking on a multitude of attackers. You must keep your eyes glued to the screen, lest you miss a single button prompt and cause Bigby to take a painful blow to the head. In Cry Wolf, there is no turning away from the violence Fabletown has become steeped in--and certainly no turning away from the wolf that has always howled out from within Bigby, hoping one day to exact vengeance. Another action scene, one similar to Episode 1's chase scene, is equally exciting, but doesn't make total sense from a plot perspective, depending on your choices. If they wanted to escape, why would the Fables you chase have chosen the obvious destination?"", ""I'm so glad to have spent time in the Fables world. I'm so glad to have gotten to mold Bigby Wolf into a redeemable hero rather than a seething mass of lupine rage. I'm disappointed by Cry Wolf, not because it suggests that Fabletown is destined to remain troubled, or that it doesn't overtly answer a vital nagging question, but because a few too many events are overtly manufactured to fit the plot's needs, rather than making each event feel like it progressed from those that came before. But there's no denying the episode's emotional impact, even in the midst of some questionable plotting. One goodbye in particular had me close to tears as one of Fabletown's few innocents asked me to pass on a gift to the only Fables who had ever shown him kindness. The road this Fable was soon to take was paved with Bigby's good intentions, but as The Wolf Among Us reminded me in its final episode, such paths may still lead to hell."", ' ']"Nick Capozzoli,7-Jul-14,Richard & Alice Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/richard-alice-review/1900-6415814/,5,PC,"['Nuclear war. Pandemic. Meteors. Zombies. With all the death and devastation in syndication these days it\'s become harder to discern the older, less ruinous meaning of the word apocalypse--that of simply ""uncovering"" or ""revealing."" But even as our media comes up with ever more creative ways to destroy civilization (wait, we\'re doing the monkey one again?), it\'s offered us simpler revelations. One post-apocalyptic priest in Richard & Alice offers a characteristically concise one: ""We\'re all just trying to exist for another day. See the sun rise in the morning, then see it set once more.""', ""That's a lot to ask for the eponymous duo, as it turns out. Richard & Alice occupy opposing prison cells, and though they're actually pretty cushy, as cells go, neither comes with a view. Not that there'd be much to see, what with the bulk of the outside world brought to its knees by crippling snowfall and cold. This point & click drama by Lewis Denby and Ashton Raze doesn't dwell on the particulars of that nasty bit of climate change, and that omission tells us a good bit about where its storytelling priorities lie. Richard is neurotic from his mostly solitary confinement, and preoccupied with the elaborate maintenance claims he files with his computer (they really are cushy cells). Alice is prone to bouts of dark sarcasm, and through a series of playable flashbacks we're shown that she's also a devoted mother of a five year old named Barney. As the stage shifts between Richard's point of view in the present and Alice's in the past, we're gradually brought up to speed on how each arrived at such bleak circumstance."", 'Advancing the narrative requires solving rudimentary item-based puzzles of the ""use rust remover on rusty ladder"" ilk. It is the apocalypse, so crowbars and lighters fill the ad hoc roles that keycards and cryptexes play in less grimdark puzzle games. I\'m all for the miracle of mundane things--anyone who\'s played The Last of Us can testify to the life-saving properties of a good pair of scissors--but sometimes their contrivance in Richard & Alice beggars belief.', ""But then, the end of the world itself feels a little suspect here, from the limited scope of devastation that Alice and Barney witness, right on down to the high school mascot-style name of the gang that waylays the survivors: the Polar Bears. Alice's game efforts to shield Barney from the horrors of their world seem to have proven too effective: the child doesn't seem to have the faintest comprehension of them. It's a dynamic that's played to good effect during a few tense early moments, as Alice struggles to convey a sense of urgency to her son without tipping him off to imminent dangers. But over the broader course of the game, Barney's saccharine naivete pushes on past the point of plausibility."", ""As the stage shifts between Richard's point of view in the present and Alice's in the past, we're gradually brought up to speed on how each arrived at such bleak circumstance."", 'But it\'s the art that ultimately fails to sell this version of the apocalypse. Not the stubby, monochromatic trees, or the bizarre, bowlegged stance that makes Alice look like a Matryoshka doll in mom jeans. It\'s the snow--or rather, the lack thereof. The white, pixel-sized snowflakes don\'t register on the white field that covers the ground, so it\'s hard to even tell that it\'s snowing in the first place. It certainly doesn\'t bury anything, or even pile into drifts. It doesn\'t change the landscape or otherwise disrupt the hard horizontal lines of the man-made environment. This snow wouldn\'t get you out of a school day anywhere above the 35-degree latitude line. Ditto for the cold, which the characters seem to be selectively aware of. So when Alice and Barney rest for a spell near a frozen lake, the scene\'s so free of danger that you can imagine the Peanuts gang cutting figures in the ice to ""Christmas Time is Here.""', ""An apocalypse can't reveal something if it hasn't been covered over in the first place. There's some strong writing in Richard & Alice, and a little bit of intrigue in the way the story's various threads wind their way back together. But when the game fails to convince us of its own high stakes, its Cormac McCarthyism loses its gloomy appeal. People will do terrible things to others to survive. Innocence should be treasured. Surely we don't have to destroy the world one more time to find those things out?""]"Carolyn Petit,7-Jul-14,Child of Light Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/child-of-light-review/1900-6415812/,8,PlayStation Vita,"[""Fairy tales may be works of escapism, but no fairy tale worth its salt is purely a work of frivolous fantasy. No, the best fairy tales simultaneously let children escape from the frightening realities of life, while also helping them confront those realities, teaching them that even though life is difficult and scary sometimes, they are capable of overcoming adversity and coping with loss. Child of Light is a fine fairy tale in this tradition, a fantasy that deals with the reality of what it means to grow up. It's also a gorgeous game with an engaging turn-based battle system and wondrous realms that are a joy to discover and explore. After coming to consoles and PC earlier this year, the game has made its way to the Vita, and it's as excellent as ever."", ""Child of Light tells the story of Aurora, daughter of an Austrian duke in the late 1800s who finds herself transported to the land of Lemuria. Here, she learns that it is her destiny to recover the sun, moon, and stars from the evil queen who has stolen the light from the land. At first, she is understandably reluctant and even petulant about having this responsibility thrust upon her shoulders when all she wants to do is wake up back in Austria and hurry to her heartsick father's side. It's the way that she grows over the course of the game that makes her journey meaningful. She befriends a diverse group of characters who all have struggles of their own and who find their strength in each other, and her journey is empowering, but not altogether joyous. Child of Light is a richer game for the ways in which it acknowledges the hard decisions and the inevitable sadness that are part and parcel of leaving childhood behind."", 'Unfortunately, the game\'s writing sometimes distracts from the emotion of its story. Characters speak in rhyme, and at times, the words they use are clumsy and forced, chosen to fit into the rhyming structure rather than to effectively communicate what the characters are thinking or feeling. At least the game has some fun with its own convention via the character of Rubella, an aspiring circus jester who goofs up every exchange, using a word that doesn\'t rhyme with what came before (""vocalist"") when a perfectly common and obvious word (""singer"") would have worked just fine.', ""But if the writing sometimes keeps you at arms length, the visuals pull you in completely. The distinctive realms of Lemuria are more reminiscent of the off-kilter fantasy lands of films like The Neverending Story and The Dark Crystal than of the Tolkienesque high fantasy that informs so many games. Your quest takes you high and low, to platforms held in the sky by massive balloons and into crystal caverns under the surface of the land. and everywhere you go, their melancholy beauty makes them a pleasure to behold, and their imaginative design creates the feeling that you don't know what other strange wonders Lemuria might have for you to discover."", ""You travel through Lemuria from a two-dimensional side-view perspective, and though you're bound to the ground like an ordinary girl when the game begins, early on you gain the power of flight. There are plenty of treasure chests for you to discover and optional side quests to complete, giving you an incentive to venture off the beaten path, soar up into the skies and explore every nook and cranny of these lands. Many areas also have environmental hazards and traps for you to avoid, and though these never pose too much of a challenge, they make navigating the world a bit trickier and more involving than it would be if it didn't have any dangers."", ""The real danger of Lemuria is in its monsters. You can see them in the environment which typically makes avoiding them easy, but more often than not, you'll want to fly into them, both because Child of Light's combat is enjoyable and because you'll want to level up your characters to prepare them for the challenges ahead. Battles are built on a foundation of traditional turn-based role-playing game combat, but there are enough wrinkles here to give you plenty to think about. You can rarely just spam standard attacks endlessly on your way to victory."", ""You can only have two characters in combat at any one time, but you can swap out one character for another instantly when his or her turn comes along, and switching between characters with the offensive muscle you want and those with the healing abilities you need to stay alive is one concern. And you can use the glow of Aurora's firefly friend Igniculus to slow down enemies' progress along the timeline. Your goal with this is typically to have your attacks strike enemies just before they would have attack you, which interrupts their attacks and knocks them backwards on the timeline, effectively denying them a chance to act. It's particularly satisfying to get into a rhythm where you keep knocking enemies back, using Igniculus to slow them down just enough so that they're right where you want them and then using your characters' own attacks to interrupt them again and again."", ""Battles are also rewarding because of the steady clip at which your characters level up. After almost every battle, at least one of your characters advances, getting boosts to stats as well as earning skill points that you can use to unlock additional stat boosts or more powerful skills. Of course, it's fun to see your characters become stronger over the course of the game, but what makes Child of Light meaningful is the way that Aurora grows emotionally stronger. Eventually we have to leave the realms of fairy tales behind and face the challenges of reality once more, but Lemuria is the kind of fantasy realm that stays with you as long as you remain a child somewhere in your heart.""]"Josiah Renaudin,2-Jul-14,Spoiler Alert Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/spoiler-alert-review/1900-6415811/,4,PC,"[""A game based on a single gimmick can remain entertaining for only so long. Spoiler Alert, a 2D platformer from indie developer Megafuzz Games, flips the usual script by running each of its 100 levels filled with patterned enemies and scalable cliffs in reverse. The hand-drawn hero shuffles his feet backward as he un-jumps on enemies, sucks fireballs back into his gullet, and coughs up the coins collected when the level was originally conquered. It's a clever twist on a genre everyone is familiar with, but unfortunately, Spoiler Alert shows off its best and only trick almost immediately, and fails to introduce anything beyond it."", 'For reasons beyond understanding, you play as a spicy chili pepper who uses his stubby legs to moonwalk all the way to the ""start"" of the game. Since he has already conquered each level, the character simply walks backward as you control when and where he jumps. You revive crumpled enemies by reenacting well-timed jumps, while power-ups that give you the ability to breathe fire or throw hammers have to be collected and returned to their original positions before a world can be considered complete. The actions in which the character originally collected coins, dealt with enemies, and scaled obstacles must be re-created, giving you little wiggle room from level to level.', ""The timing of it all can be frustrating early on: anticipating the arc of your jump to land on the lifeless body of a colorful gnome takes a few tries to get right. However, after you catch your groove, you can rush through an entire world packed with 30 unique stages in 10 to 15 minutes. Besting screen after screen of challenges is rewarding, but once you understand the mechanics and see the clear patterns, the one-note design becomes apparent and the flow continues uninterrupted. Spoiler Alert concludes not long after you defeat the first--or technically final--boss. You'd expect 100 levels to lead to hours of action, but since the majority of stages might last fewer than 10 seconds, you can easily see all of the provided content in under an hour's time. There's a certain satisfaction to mastering the game's timing and besting level after level without a hitch, but there's not enough content to back up the design. Spoiler Alert feels less like a full release and more like a paid trial. There's a speed run feature where you're asked to un-play the entire game from finish to start, but after you've un-beaten the game once, it's difficult to find motivation to trudge your way through it all again."", ""Take away the feature attraction of undoing stage after stage of activities, and you're left with a colorful yet monotonous runner devoid of challenge and inspiration in which the only substantial change between locations is the scenery. If you're unsatisfied with the suite of content provided, there's a level editor included with the Steam-exclusive Collector's Edition that allows you to flex the muscles of your imagination. All of the in-game assets are easily dragged and dropped into your own unique levels, and the simplicity and scope of Spoiler Alert's stages make creating your own reverse runner more straightforward and appealing than the typical suite of such tools."", ""The accessible creation options notwithstanding, the glitz covering this stunted platformer isn't enough to glamorize its one-note concept. Spoiler Alert fails to remain interesting over the course of its brief runtime, and while I found myself interested in seeing what would be thrown my way early on, a lack of imagination keeps the entire package from feeling complete. A unique concept needs a supporting cast of good ideas to flourish, and Spoiler Alert's lone conceit doesn't have the charms to carry the weight of an entire game on its shoulders.""]"Daniel Starkey,2-Jul-14,Xenonauts Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/xenonauts-review/1900-6415810/,8,PC,"[""Let's be honest. If aliens were to invade right now, chances are pretty good humanity would have a tough time of it, but we might have a chance. In 1979, though? Before we had stealth fighters, before we had directed energy weapons, before supercomputers or the Internet as we know it today? We'd be crushed. Xenonauts places the future of Cold War-era humankind on your shoulders, and it's about as punishingly difficult as it should be given the setting. If the brain-melting strategy doesn't scare you away, you'll find a beautifully atmospheric game that evokes the purest dread and desperation."", ""Any discussion of Xenonauts must make a nod to its clear inspiration, X-COM. While I'd like to say that this is a spiritual sequel to 1994's X-COM: UFO Defense, it's a lot more accurate to say that it's more of a remake than even Firaxis' XCOM: Enemy Unknown. Xenonauts strikes a balance between large-scale, real-time global logistics and small-scale personnel tactics. You must capture and research alien technology in the dire hope that humanity can reverse-engineer weapons to match and ultimately exceed those of the invaders before it's too late. You may also name your squads after friends and family to make ckear the human costs of war. With these parallels, Xenonauts struggles to establish its own identity. There are only a handful of substantive differences between it and the games that preceded it, and while each difference adds a lot to the game, it's also impossible to shake the feeling that you've done this all before."", ""The war for Earth is pretty slow at first. The aliens you face hail from a planet with an extremely thin atmosphere, and they have to modify their ships before they can land. This minor narrative touch may seem insignificant, but it gives the early hours coherence by explaining the slow ramp-up in the enemy offensive. It's apparent that you're living on borrowed time. These visitors aren't friendly, and they have Earth surrounded."", ""Your main goal is to construct and maintain bases that monitor and guard as much of the world's airspace as possible, as well as to launch ground missions to recover alien technology or capture one alien leaders. And thus rises the multilayered strategy that links everything together. You need cash to run your bases, supply your troops, and keep the aliens from wiping out humanity. Missions help keep the international community happy, which keeps the money flowing. Every mechanic feeds into another, and a weak plan on one front can have a lot of critical repercussions. When starting up Xenonauts for the first time, I attempted to build two bases right off the bat. I wanted to secure a decent chunk of the planet and steadily expand from there. Unfortunately, founding and supplying two facilities rapidly drains your cash and keeps you from being able to carefully invest in the development of new, efficient weapons and tech for your soldiers and fighter jets. That doesn't mean it's impossible, but poorly conceived plans lead to humanity's doom."", ""It's immediately apparent that you're living on borrowed time."", ""Failing to protect some regions causes your program to steadily lose funding as those regions lose faith in the Xenonauts project. Because humanity as a whole is on the defensive, downing enemy aircraft is your bread and butter. You need to keep UFOs from bombing cities, abducting citizens, or straight-up attacking your bases. Initially, that's not a tall order. At first, only small craft like probes and corvettes can be modified to enter Earth's atmosphere. Intercepting them carries virtually no risk. You can have battles auto-resolve, with the game using basic aircraft statistics to determine the victor. If you prefer more direct interaction, you can play out the dogfights with a system that very closely resembles Cold War-era radar screens. Ships and planes are represented by green 2D sprites, and their firing arcs and weapon ranges are clearly displayed. If you're careful, manual dogfights can assist you in your path to victory. About midway through the game, I was lagging behind my fighter upgrades and couldn't keep up with the stronger, faster alien vessels, but I could still survive thanks to smart maneuvering. With a few careful clicks and some liberal use of my afterburners, I kept two of my jets in the aliens' blind spots and downed the ships before they could reach Dublin and initiate a wholesale slaughter."", ""When you can successfully scrap a UFO over land, you have a narrow window in which you can launch an automated airstrike to clear out all of the alien troops and pick up a moderate amount of cash, or you can choose to launch a ground mission. These have you organize landing squads to scavenge what alien tech you can and bring it back for future research. They also give your soldiers an opportunity to accumulate valuable battlefield experience, dramatically improving their stats over time. The surviving extraterrestrial troops and robots attempt to fight you off, making these missions dangerous propositions. The technological superiority of your foes makes itself readily apparent here; the extraterrestrial soldiers can immediately kill one of your soldiers if you're not extremely careful. Your weapons, and later your cheap imitations of the alien weapons, just aren't as effective. These ground missions help distinguish Xenonauts from its influences. Whereas XCOM: Enemy Unknown had small, tight levels that helped clearly identify threats, Xenonauts has sprawling levels with extremely limited visibility. Cover is also of limited use; in almost every case it can be destroyed with a few shots or a stray grenade. During night missions, your soldiers have severely limited visibility. The aliens, once again, have an advantage, with infrared vision. The result is an extremely lethal set of missions that help drive home the overwhelming danger posed by Earth's visitors."", ""During one excursion, with a squad of battle-hardened veterans, I caught myself screaming at my computer screen, begging them to stop succumbing to a previously unknown line of alien androids for just a few more turns. After the anger and panic subsided, I realized I had no one else to blame but myself for the loss. Yes, Xenonauts is lethal, but never unfairly so. The environments are almost completely destructible with the right gear, and once you've cleared an area of civilians, wanton destruction comes with almost no penalty. Xenonauts necessitates a metered ruthlessness, a barely contained thirst for devastation that you periodically release to ensure absolute dominance. This is ultimately the game's single best design decision. Xenonaut's gameplay ably complements its narrative. You aren't just told to feel desperate; you must take desperate measures to have any hope of victory."", ""Unfortunately, while Xenonauts creates a network of mutually reinforcing sections, it borrows too heavily from the 1994 X-COM in some not-so-flattering ways. The user interface can be obnoxious and obtuse. Even with an internal game manual, I didn't figure out that right-clicking and dragging would change which direction a soldier was facing until a few too many hours into my first run. Outfitting your squads with the gear and equipment they need can also be a pain. In addition, the game's uninspired visuals lack the panache of its more recent competitor, XCOM: Enemy Unknown, which magnified powerful attacks with its cinematic, over-the-shoulder camera. A similar brand of drama could have made Xenonauts' battles all the more thrilling, but the distant camera keeps the action at arm's length."", 'Xenonauts is an unlikely success, a challenging clone of a beloved classic with enough tweaks to entice fans and newcomers alike. It might look rather cheap at first glance, but underneath that rough exterior lies something special. Breaking the game down and looking at all of its pieces in isolation would do the game a disservice, because every facet helps focus the true luster of the whole.']"Carolyn Petit,27-Jun-14,Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/transformers-rise-of-the-dark-spark-review/1900-6415809/,4,PC,"[""When I was a kid, Optimus Prime seemed to me like everything a leader should be: intelligent, compassionate, and, of course, capable of turning into a truck. It's been frustrating in recent years to see the Transformers become defined in this generation not by the charm and personality of the original cartoon but by the cacophonous stupidity and visual chaos of the Michael Bay films. I always hope that video games might be the one area where the Transformers can be redeemed. Alas, Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark is not the game that redeems them."", ""Though it's developed by Edge of Reality, Rise of the Dark Spark's action is closely modeled on developer High Moon's games War for Cybertron and Fall of Cybertron. Narratively, however, where this game falls is completely unclear. In some ways, it seems to exist in the same universe as the cartoons, but on the other hand, the robot designs sometimes resemble those from the films, and there are plot details that refer to Michael Bay's latest opus, Transformers: Age of Extinction. The result is an incoherent story that feels like it was cobbled together from the spare parts of other stories."", '', ""The gameplay doesn't fare much better. High Moon's Cybertron games were mostly enjoyable shooting galleries, and there are times when Rise of the Dark Spark seems like it might manage to be the same. Playing as a variety of Autobots and Decepticons over the course of the game, you unleash hot robot death on countless enemy grunts. At its best moments, Rise of the Dark Spark is fun in the generic and familiar way that so many blandly competent shooters are fun--a pleasant enough way to pass the time if you have nothing else to do. There are a good variety of weapons for you to use, and although you rarely have much incentive to transform, it's nice to have the freedom to drive or fly away from enemies when the action heats up."", ""Unfortunately, although you move around with a feeling of appropriate heft for a sentient being constructed of strong and heavy metals, when you get swarmed by enemies, you go down so fast that you might as well be made of aluminum cans. It drains all the joy from being Optimus Prime to see him crumple almost immediately in response to enemy fire, and these poorly designed combat encounters make victory not a matter of playing defensively and using smart tactics but of just trying again and again and hoping this time it works out for you. Some sections go on for much too long, keeping you stuck in one spot fighting off waves of identical enemies when all you want to do is advance, and the game's maddening checkpoints regularly require you to replay lengthy sections of frustrating action when you fall in battle."", 'In fact, Rise of the Dark Spark\'s entire campaign goes on for too long. By the time you come to the end of its 14 chapters, you\'ll have had enough of shooting robots to last you at least until the next three Transformers movies have been released. It doesn\'t help that the game is so unpleasant to look at and to listen to. The urban environments on Earth are so drab and simple that they look like the miniature set of a low-budget monster movie rather than a real city, and the sound design may drive you insane. In one level, I heard the Decepticons shout the line ""Let\'s see what we got!"" so many times that I decided it had to be part of a psychological warfare campaign meant to undermine the Autobots\' morale.', ""Your progress is also hindered by the occasional bug, and I don't mean those pesky Insecticons. During one boss battle, I fully depleted my foe's health bar, but nothing happened. I had to let him kill me and restart the fight to advance. During another boss fight, I became completely stuck on the geometry and was helpless to defend myself against my enemy's attacks."", ""There are a few merciful moments of reprieve from the standard action, like one sequence in which, as Jetfire, you must fly your way out of a structure before a weapon goes off, and another in which you play as the massive dinobot Grimlock, who can unleash a constant stream of flame from his robotic jaws. This power trip feels like a reward for slogging through so much tedious and frustrating action, but it's too little, too late."", ""There's also Escalation, a cooperative multiplayer mode in which you and up to three other players fight off waves of invading enemies, but one wave feels very much like another. There isn't enough variety to it to keep it interesting for long. The game tries to keep you hooked by doling out a constant stream of rewards for your progress in the form of weapon upgrades, experience point boosts, and other doodads, but the action is too shallow to make any of these rewards meaningful. The Transformers are a great property, one that seems like it should lend itself to the creation of great games, but Rise of the Dark Spark is so sloppy and incoherent that it feels more like a cheap knockoff than a proper Transformers game. Optimus Prime deserves better, and so do you.""]"Nick Capozzoli,27-Jun-14,Ace Combat Infinity Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ace-combat-infinity-review/1900-6415808/,6,PS3,"[""I am tired of being a mercenary. Tired of the coldness we like to imagine they espouse: the dispassionate remove from warfare, the apathy toward allegiance and ideology. Doubtless it's those very qualities that make mercenarism so appealing to the big wigs of video game publishing. The mercenary neatly lampshades the globetrotting and casual mass murder that serve as cornerstones of all the best-selling war games, and he is compensated in a currency gamers accept: the means for newer, more efficient tools of a violent trade. But those easy associations belie a vital loss, because when a series goes mercenary, it sacrifices its heart."", 'It\'s hard to look at an entry like Ace Combat Infinity and not see the ways it\'s diminished by that cynicism. You play as a pilot, of course, engaged in battle against a frightfully well-armed terrorist organization operating out of Central Asia. But you\'re also a mercenary, so any emotions that premise might elicit get a stiff-arm before they can drag the action down. Why question warfare, when there are kill count competitions to chuckle over on the comms? Why dwell on consequence, when there are battles to be had over skylines from Dubai to Tokyo? Once upon a time, Ace Combat drew its own borders, around names like Ustio and Strangereal. It has since found it more efficient, perhaps, to outsource that effort, and lean on the mental connections we make on our own when we hear mention of foreign countries or words like ""terrorist.""', ' ', ""But lazy expectations should be challenged, as Infinity's own antecedents once showed. Flight simulation is a niche genre, even when it's given an arcade slant that eschews realistic limitations--as Ace Combat traditionally does--on a plane's maneuverability and payload.

A racing game should render unto us prettier cars; a sports game could pursue nothing more noble than a reasonable facsimile of its chosen sport. But Ace Combat once chased its Top Gun guitars with Agustin Barrios Mangore. It interlaced vignettes about the personal lives of rival squadrons in among its screeching dogfights."", ""Those old games were idealistic and enthusiastic (occasionally embarrassingly so), full of operatic flourishes and moments of pathos that few video games can claim--let alone ones about planes. These were games that knew that when engagements take place over the span of miles, between pilots who never see each other's face, it's the little personal touches that keep the whole affair from feeling like a training exercise. The melancholy cutscenes. The frantic radio chatter. The call signs and emblems and the way enemies sauntered onto the field of battle like WWE wrestlers...that was what made Ace Combat human."", 'Once upon a time, Ace Combat drew its own borders, around names like Ustio and Strangereal.', ""You can still find vestiges of those features in Ace Combat Infinity, but they've been shuffled up in what's essentially a remix of the series' greatest hits. Asteroids shower Earth, decimating the population. Monolithic flying fortresses take to the skies over Tokyo. The vaunted Stonehenge cannonade from Ace Combat 4 now fires over canyons in Turkey. This all takes place over the course of five brief missions, with three more planned but nevertheless absent. The first two tastes are free--the rest must be unlocked either through weeks of workmanlike commitment, or a $20 instant access payment that feels wildly out of proportion. I find it hard to confront the commodification of those old memories. Seeing how sausage is valuated is only slightly more fun than seeing how it's made, as it turns out."", 'If we\'re to adopt the mercenary\'s Spartan sense of appraisal, I\'d put the real value on Ace Combat Infinity\'s cooperative multiplayer. Sorties there are paid for with a per diem of ""fuel,"" or an alternative that\'s depletable and restocked with cold hard cash. But a generous stream of fuel-giving challenges, gifts, and randomized bonuses ensures a thrifty player can take to battle with little in the way of personal commitment.', ""Therein, it's a four-on-four scramble to see which side can bag the most targets, while still maintaining enough semblance of alliance to score a strong combined rating. It's a unique system, and the light competition provides an impetus to perform without ever becoming overbearing. The feeling of being chased is conspicuous in its absence, though. In, say, Strike Vector, there's a give and take--a constant, whirling fear, where a sudden burst of gunfire sends you into the most convincing approximation of Brownian motion you can conjure up on the spot. Infinity's mostly inert enemies, by comparison, can feel like shooting gallery fodder."", ""The classic refinement of Ace Combat's gameplay can still shine through. And when your squadron is thrust into a pop-up battle against one of the game's white whale superweapons, it blazes. You get flickering glimpses of the underlying attraction, that passionate artistry that once allowed the series to liken the dogfight to flamenco, and not seem crazy for doing so. It's an impression that can still intermittently catch me when I watch Infinity's abstracted replays, and see my predatory arrow tracing contrails around bogeys, tying bows over enemy ground positions until the besieged markers disappear."", ""But that damned cynicism, again. It's pervasive. Maybe that's the consequence of life lived as a virtual mercenary: a joylessness that poisons the nostalgia well. The soaring bird that has long served as the metaphor for the Ace Combat pilot becomes a vulture fighting over highway carrion, looping away incautiously when the odd car passes a little too close, before returning again for a final few scraps of flesh.""]"Kevin VanOrd,26-Jun-14,WildStar Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wildstar-review/1900-6415807/,7,PC,"[""WildStar is a busy game. In every direction, shiny baubles and fluttering flags and swirling beacons of light compete for your attention. The world of Nexus is awash with color--or, more specifically, awash with all of the colors, many of them splashed across the screen at any given time as if by an artist determined to exhaust his entire supply of paint. Developer Carbine Studios, apparently unable to choose a single art style, squeezed multiple ones together, crafting an audiovisual potpourri that's as eclectic as the game's narrative themes. A horn-heavy tune, the kind John Williams would be proud to have written, calls out during a planetside battle, evoking Star Wars and its galactic tensions. Graceful gazelles glide across the grass while the music whispers a hint of Disney's Pocahontas soundtrack, at least when it isn't mirroring chord progressions from Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy. Quests and regions refer to Left 4 Dead and Firefly, and your level-up notification flashes with comic-book pizzazz. In WildStar, the pop culture references flow freely down a river of science fiction and fantasy themes, each wink and nod leaping from the waters with glee."", ""This concoction makes for an overwrought aesthetic, and while I am occasionally struck by the gaudiness, I'm more often struck by WildStar's beauty. But even when I venture into villages swamped in kitsch, I know that I am in Nexus. The zombies and the horned snow monsters, the hoverboards and skyboats, the aloof robots and talking vegetables are all wrapped into a world that is very much its own, no matter how easy you might think it is to compare WildStar to World of Warcraft. Such a comparison is a superficial one: where Warcraft aspires to the Warhammer universe's chunky proportions and bulging architecture, WildStar details its landscapes with bright green curlicues and gray-blue bubbles to depict grass and rocks."", ""I beg your pardon for so quickly dissecting WildStar's looks, but my adoration of an online role-playing game is directly proportional to how much I enjoy existing in its world, and how well it encourages me to leave behind the comfort of the starting areas and set my eyes upon the more perilous regions beyond. And even when I felt the grind while chasing the game's countless missions, I still felt that tingle that came from wondering what might lie outside my current zone. Early in the game, I was enamored with the aforementioned gazelle creatures and the bucolic wilds they roamed. It was here that the Aurin race rallied around an ancient (and sentient) tree--and here that the tree fell under attack. It wasn't the locals' dialogue that made me so invested in the subsequent missions, but rather the wistful climate and the nature of great beauty spoiled by war."", ""Later, when I was more directly involved with the war between WildStar's two opposing player factions--the Dominion and the Exiles--I was swept away by the audiovisual barrage that did its best to veil how endless clockwork battles between non-player characters could never truly be won. But it was these grand gestures that made me aware of my purpose on Nexus, even when the commanders that poured details into my questing journal became cliche-spouting mission machines. Even at its most charming, WildStar can't always overcome monotony; I spent more time acting as a wedding planner for talking bunny rabbits than I care to reveal, and witnessing the final ceremony wasn't much reward for the tedium of searching for lost groomsmen. But even though I was immune to the allure of trinket-toting rodents, I always presumed something more intriguing would lie around the bend. And it always did."", 'Suffice it to say, not every activity in WildStar is stuffed with meaning, but with such a breadth of content, it\'s difficult not to find appealing elements, even if you prefer to chase waypoints without paying any mind to the context. In fact, the game\'s fascination with visual gewgaws has parallels in the gameplay that make the quest writing almost superfluous. ""Collect all the litter and activate all the objects,"" Carbine seems to say, more concerned with keeping you busy than with making every activity feel all that important. What those objects might be depends on the path you choose when creating your character. Paths are independent of your race and class; think of them as professions that open up different ways of interacting with the world. Scientists keep themselves busy fixing robots and scanning monsters, while adventurers leap to higher ground looking for artifacts and hidden nooks.', ""I'm a settler. I collect resources and use them to erect various machines and miscellany--gadgets that give you health boosts, campfires for cooking, and so forth. There's appeal in feeling like I'm gathering items for the greater good, knowing that the taxi stand I build will enable fellow Exiles to travel more efficiently, or that the vendbot I summon might help a teammate empty his pockets of useless items and pad her pocketbook. Other tasks aren't all that substantial; I run about villages lighting fires on spindly tiki torches and planting flowers to brighten up the decor in addition to my more relevant community services. Profuse scatterings of collectibles and items, each object labeled with an icon that urges you to interact with it, ensure you have lots of stuff to do, but it's undeniable busywork: interaction for the sake of interaction."", ""To its great credit, WildStar makes the most vital elements--movement and combat--energetic and enjoyable. This isn't the first massively multiplayer online game to include a double jump, but it's the first such double jump that has felt so free and easy. I enjoy the basics of locomotion here, most often for the breezy animations and the overall sense that Nexus is a fine place to spread your allegorical wings. I occasionally found myself leaping into the most unusual places as I followed trails of settler resources, surprised that areas so unlikely to be traversed were still built with great care so that players wouldn't get stuck in crevasses. The primary obstacle to exploration is the world itself, which doesn't hew to a consistent set of physical rules; mild hills block your passage with invisible walls and steep inclines that look insurmountable pave the way to higher vantage points."", ""You needn't travel by foot. My current ride of choice is a hoverboard, though your first vehicle will be one tamed creature or another--no boring horses here. Whether you stay on foot or not, however, your travels inevitably lead you into battle. In the most basic sense, WildStar is built on the foundation that countless games have laid before it: you earn new skills as you level up, and equip those skills to a hotbar, tapping your number keys to fire off spells or bullets, or to slash away at an attacking creature's grotesque face with a set of claws."", ""Profuse scatterings of collectibles and items, each object labeled with an icon that urges you to interact with it, ensure you have lots of stuff to do, but it's undeniable busywork: interaction for the sake of interaction."", ""If the sight of a hotbar inspires within you eye-rolling assumptions that WildStar must be the same old tap-and-wait experience, take delight in knowing that this specific brand of MMOG combat is built to keep you mobile. You couldn't confuse WildStar with an action game--there's no sense that each key press results in an immediate, weighty onscreen action--but cooldowns are quick, and most skills are assigned an area of effect rather than being limited to a single target. My primary character is a spellslinger who uses her dual pistols to inflict as much damage as possible, though spellslingers aren't necessarily concerned just with cutting down the enemy; they can also act as healers. Skills typically emanate in arcs, cones, circles, and rectangles, affecting the players and creatures unlucky enough (or lucky enough) to stand within range of your fury."", ""Enemies telegraph their strongest attacks with similar tells, the most powerful of them requiring you to roll and leap around to avoid the red patches that designate dangerous areas. Out in the rolling hills and snow-covered meadows of Nexus, this makes for fun adventuring, whether you're on your own or tagging along with other players. You're likely to run into a few idiosyncrasies as you traverse Nexus, many of them to be found within snowy Whitevale, where bizarre enemy leash ranges can make some open-world skirmishes a hassle. (In this region, some creatures can move only a foot or two from the location to which they are leashed before the game replenishes their health bars and they hop a few steps back to their original spot.) WildStar is generally stable and feature-complete, however, and such easily fixed foibles are momentary distractions and not signals of deeper troubles."", '', ""In the game's dungeons and adventure scenarios, tensions rise substantially. One dungeon boss proved problematic for my five-player party, which struggled to collect incoming green orbs before they could reach--and buff--the hulk demanding our heads. It wasn't the creature's main attacks that proved most problematic, however, but the treacherous spheroids that sometimes radiated from the beast, temporarily turning WildStar into a bullet-hell shooter. We ultimately succeeded, though only two of us were standing when the ogre finally fell."", ""Such battles require you to keep a close eye on enemy behavior, but the chaos is rarely overpowering, making such challenges welcome outliers in a genre rarely singled out for requiring skillful play. Cooperative levels called adventures are the most rewarding places to prove your mettle, given their creative use of ideas not often associated with MMOGs. The War of the Wilds adventure, for instance, appropriates elements of competitive arena games like League of Legends, unleashing waves of AI grunts that complicate your goal of capturing more flags than your computer-controlled rivals. You dodge out of range of a bearded abominable snowman and into a healer's green arc of healing, all while setting fire to the rampaging hordes. Adventures are fun--and more vitally, they are fun to return to again and again."", 'Player-versus-player battlegrounds are subject to the whims of human players, making them even more frantic than adventures and dungeons--sometimes too frantic, actually; some battles require all of your senses just to make sense of the hodgepodge of red and green arcs players paint onto the ground while attacking. These capture-the-flag and assault-and-defend variants are fortunately exciting even when the undisciplined visuals threaten anarchy, at least, and opening the caches of goodies you reap as rewards for victory often comes with the possibility of receiving some house decor for your troubles.', ""You will likely collect such decor even before you reach level 15, the level at which you may unlock access to your very own plot of land. Player housing is a welcome offering, a once-standard feature now often relegated to a post-release patch, if it is ever added at all. Delightfully, your home in WildStar is not just a house, but an entire floating island upon which your abode is but one element. You can plant gardens, set up healing stations, place crafting tables, and even erect a dungeon upon your island in the sky, thus making your home a useful destination and not just a virtual status symbol. Some players have used the items they purchase and collect (beds, trees, empty toilet tissue rolls, wall art, and so forth) to craft jumping puzzles upon their plots. I've approached my home as a dollhouse, taking great care to maximize its attractiveness, rotating and resizing tables and chairs as if I might be preparing a fancy tea party."", 'Alas, the only drink I\'m serving right now is the moonshine I created by jumping up and down in a giant vat of fermented fruit. Oh WildStar, how charming and brassy you are, how loud and brazen and often irresistible you are. Your charisma has dulled over time, I\'m afraid; I\'m less beguiled by your thematic mishmash than I was when I started, yet there are still crannies I have yet to peek into, and I\'m itching to discover what might be crammed into them. More than likely, I\'ll find more things to collect, more quests to take, and more outposts promising refuge. WildStar inspires compulsion, laying down trails of tasty candies that lead to even more candy trails, and in doing so, makes the case that ""fun"" can be a fine cornerstone around which to construct a massive adventure.']"Mark Walton,26-Jun-14,Killzone: Shadow Fall Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/killzone-shadow-fall-intercept-review/1900-6415806/,6,PS4,"[""What's your favorite kind of co-op shooter? The ultra-competitive, team-based thrills of a Battlefield Domination match? The wave-based panic of Gears of War's Horde mode? Or maybe you're partial to the strategic gore-fest that is a game of Left 4 Dead? Judging by the four-player co-op on offer in Killzone: Shadow Fall Intercept, developer Guerrilla is very much a fan of all three. But while those games carefully home in on a single mechanic, much to their benefit, Intercept is a rather heterogeneous creation by comparison."", ""Don't get me wrong: Intercept's class-based, four-player co-op is by no means an awful thing. But after a day of showing hundreds of Helghast the business end of a shotgun, I can't shake the feeling that it tries to do far too much for its own good. Fun was had, but not the sort of rollicking good time that made me want to shout about it afterward. Take the four classes on offer, for example: the assault class is armed to the teeth, the tactician lays turrets, the medic heals and revives fallen allies, and the marksman brings up the rear with a sniper rifle."", ""These are the archetypal class roles for a shooter, which would be fine, except that there's nothing about any of these classes that stands out from the regular Shadow Fall fare. Sure, there's the class-wide ability to wield a drone for protection, the odd speed boost, and the ability to lay shields or ammo packs. But all the classes handle the same, so the heavy isn't any slower than the medic, for example. Even their weapon selection becomes a moot point once you've unlocked some new ones (there are 20 in total to choose from, including those from the Insurgent downloadable content pack), giving you things like a shotgun-wielding medic that's pretty good in a firefight."", ""Customization is nice to have, but limitations are often there in co-op for a reason, and in the case of Intercept, it would have made each character feel that little bit more special. That mundane feeling extends out onto the battlefield, where you must defend three control points from waves of AI Helghast, while also racking up a certain number of points for your team to win the match. Each map consists of a home base, where a spot called a bank lies. Therein lies Intercept's core risk/reward mechanic. You earn points by killing Helghast and healing teammates and the like, which increases your score multiplier. However, if you get killed, all those points and your score multiplier disappear."", ""I can't shake the feeling that it tries to do far too much for its own good."", ""To win the match, it's your team's score, not yours, that counts. That means periodically running back to base to deposit your points while weighing whether to hang onto them for a higher score or risk losing them all. You can kill hundreds of Helghast, but if you keep getting killed and fail to deposit points, the match will go on indefinitely, or at least until you hit zero points. Respawning without a medic costs 50 points, so going without a healer is an entirely possible scenario if everyone's a bit gung ho with deposits."", ""On paper, that sounds like an interesting, even potentially entertaining, mechanic. But while it has its moments, there's just not enough depth for it to hold your attention for long. Matches quickly become a repetitive slog of smashing out a few kills and running back to base to cash them in. There's little incentive to build up those big score multipliers, because more often than not, a slow and steady buildup of points easily wins the match."", ' ', ""Unfortunately, there's little else in Intercept to liven the action. Carrying capacitors back to purchase temporary power-ups like miniguns, damage boosts, and bunny-hopping jetpacks is fine, but the capacitors themselves often spawn in exactly the same place, while the power-ups lack the visual pizzazz to make them interesting. I want to know when I'm doing double damage, or am suddenly armed with a jetpack and machine gun. I want the game to shout it out at me, flash some killer graphics on the screen, and make me feel like I've really achieved something, rather than just timidly changing a tiny icon at the bottom of the screen."", ""Then there are the Helghast themselves, who we're told are powered by an AI commander that picks the best strategy based on your progress. (Sound familiar?) Certainly, there were some particularly hairy moments where the AI had my team surrounded and vastly overpowered. Only by working together as a team, carefully placing turrets around capture points, healing where necessary, and sniping from afar, were we able to overcome them. But these moments were the exception rather than the rule, and even then, it seemed the AI was merely throwing more soldiers at the problem rather than coming up with some kind of intelligent strategy."", 'Interspersed between the regular enemies and the losing and capturing of control points are the boss battles, which are extremely disappointing. Much like how Gears would send out a grinder, or L4D would send out a tank to spice things up, Intercept wheels out bosses based on characters from the single-player campaign. However, these bosses are a feeble imitation. The most I ever saw one do was teleport to another area of the map, or cloak, but otherwise, there was little to tell them apart from a standard enemy other than a higher health bar and some cheesy voice-over.', 'All the elements are there for a good time in Intercept, but none shine enough on their own to be melded together into a cohesive whole. The four maps Intercept is currently set in--Market, Highway, DMZ, and Outpost, with six more on the way for free--are at least well designed, even if the mysterious blue shield walls around their rims sometimes prevent you from making the flanking moves you so desire. The usual array of leaderboards, challenges, and trophies make up the metagame, while three different game lengths (based on the total number of points needed to win) mean you can play small, 15-minute skirmishes, all the way through to epic hour-long battles.', ""Whether Intercept can keep you entertained for such lengths of time, I'm not so sure. It takes just a few matches to realize that the magical multiplayer spark, that itch that must be scratched by just one more match, is sorely lacking. This is a technically competent add-on that feels like it was designed to latch onto a growing co-op trend and to plug a gap in the game's multiplayer repertoire because the market research said to, rather than something designed with some real heart and soul behind it.""]"Tom Mc Shea,26-Jun-14,Shovel Knight Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/shovel-knight-review/1900-6415805/,7,PC & 3DS & Wii U,"['Calling Shovel Knight ""old-fashioned"" isn\'t derogatory. Rather, its brazen re-creation of established conventions only proves that some ideas, no matter how dusty they may appear, are engaging no matter what era we\'re in. There\'s no expiration date on immediate combat in which smart positioning is as important as deft attacks, or branching stages that hide secret passageways for those anxious to quench their inquisitive flames. Shovel Knight doesn\'t add anything novel over what we\'ve seen in countless older games; it doesn\'t reinvent its core concepts into a decidedly new experience. Rather, it shows just how exciting a traditional adventure can still be, making technological innovations seem superfluous when pure fun is all you crave.', ""Everything in Shovel Knight can be classified as old in one way or another. The story, in which two fearsome knights are separated by a malevolent force and one (the man) must rescue the other (the woman), belongs to a bygone era. Simple aesthetics owe much to the visual design and musical scores from when sprites and MIDI were still the dominant forms of artistic expression. And beyond those surface details lie references to the progenitors of Shovel Knight's exploits. The knights who serve as bosses borrow heavily from the robot masters of the Mega Man series, complete with their own descriptive quirks that dictate not only their attacks, but the traps populating their stages. Towns that you duck into could have been pulled from Zelda II: The Adventure of Link (though there is thankfully no one named Error present). And you'd be forgiven for mistaking your pogo attack for Scrooge McDuck's from DuckTales."", ""Rather than relying on conjuring pleasant memories from a simpler time, however, Shovel Knight is fun because its many components are well realized. Take the combat as an example of where Shovel Knight proves its worth based on its own merits. Combat is position-based because knockbacks are so prevalent. Not only can enemies shove you into bottomless pits with a timely attack, but striking baddies with your shovel also nudges you toward the void. It's a system that demands careful planning even though your repertoire is limited. Attack too soon or late, and you're liable to meet an untimely end, so the precision needed to survive unscathed pulls you in to the life-or-death showdowns."", ""Some ideas, no matter how dusty they may appear, are engaging no matter what era we're in."", ""Pits are the number one danger you face. Mistiming a jump is a common occurrence, especially when there are enemies waiting for you to make a mistake, so the majority of my failures came from careless stumbling. Generous checkpoints ensure backtracking is kept to a minimum, and though this eliminated frustration, the prevalence of safety nets meant I was rarely forced to alter my strategy. Mere competence is enough to get from one checkpoint to the next, which was disheartening considering how punishing similar games have been. It's difficult to strike that balance between challenge and accessibility, and Shovel Knight leans a little too far to the latter side."", ""Whining that Shovel Knight is slightly too easy doesn't seem fair considering how much I enjoyed venturing through every stage. However, because I so rarely feared for my life, I never felt the need to master every item that I unlocked. Sure, I could have made clever use of my invincibility cloak, or figured out a way to use a thunderous punch mid-battle, but there was no need to delve deeper into my tactics. I relied on my standard strike, pogo attack, and fireball for much of the adventure, so though puzzling out how best to defeat each foe was still enjoyable, any variety was my own doing rather than the game's demand. That sadly remained unchanged even in New Game Plus. Patience and precision are enough to vanquish any stage, so much of my inventory remained unused, and my strategy never wavered."", ""These problems didn't become apparent until I revisited stages. Games cut from a retro cloth tend to hold my attention for dozens of hours as I hunt down every secret and master the many confrontations. But there was no such draw here. Still, during my first time through, the stages were fluid and dynamic, presenting so many architectural and adversarial changes that I was continually enraptured. Seeing disinterested hamsters attached to propellers made me laugh with joy, and matching wits against shield-bearing knights provided many humbling outcomes. Braving the darkness of one level and the wind of another demanded different skills, and never knowing what awaited me in the next screen kept me slightly unhinged. What madness would be expected of me? Would I have to eliminate the spirits haunting a house? Or navigate platforms while magma poured from above? Shovel Knight's bountiful charms are so immediate and satisfying that I couldn't stop myself from forging ahead to see what else lay before me."", ""The branching level design also beckoned. Shovel Knight is strictly linear, except if you have an inquisitive nature. False walls give way to myriad places where bountiful treasure is stored. A sharp-eyed individual should find half of what's out there the first time through, but even after visiting each stage multiple times, there were still a handful of tricky items that I couldn't locate. The reward for uncovering a secret is mostly intangible--the money from treasure chests doesn't matter once there's nothing else to buy--and though I drew great joy from trying to secure every bit of treasure initially, my interest waned as time elapsed. The core action wasn't as exciting on repeat visits. With so few surprises waiting for me, and no need to vary my strategies, I was lulled by predictability."", ""So, Shovel Knight doesn't hold up upon a second and third playthrough. That's a black mark if you're keen on starting fresh after the credits role, but there's no shame in lessened impact on repeat visits. There is one element that remained gripping no matter how often I played it, though: boss fights. These are pattern-based affairs that test your reaction time, punish your recklessness, and make you feel incredibly powerful once you come out on top. These encounters are the one situation that I had to make use of my expansive inventory as I searched for an item that would give me the upper hand. I would toss deadly balls to deal massive damage, use a magic sword to glide through the air unscathed, and turn invincible when I needed a breather. And when the difficulty ramped up in New Game Plus, I was brought to my knees more often than Id like to admit."", 'No matter which era it had been released in, Shovel Knight would have been embraced. Its inherent charms are timeless. Shovel Knight is a good reminder that game design does age but can never die and that simple mechanics can still be immensely satisfying. But this is not another classic. History echoes forth in everything that Shovel Knight does, but while its inspirations offer compelling moments decades after they were first released, this adventure loses its impact all too quickly. Much of what draws me to games of this ilk are repeatedly playing through them, differing my tactics to become more efficient at whatever challenges lie before me. Without that aspect present in Shovel Knight, I was left with an ""is that all?"" feeling when the well ran dry. Shovel Knight is a memorable re-imagining of what I grew up with, but doesn\'t have the longevity or inventiveness to be great in its own right.', ' ']"Heidi Kemps,25-Jun-14,Magical Beat Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/magical-beat-review/1900-6415804/,6,PlayStation Vita,"['Developer Arc System Works is best known for its fighting games, which include favorites like BlazBlue, Guilty Gear, and Persona 4 Arena. But the company is much more than a fighting game factory; it also creates and publishes numerous smaller games of varied genres. Magical Beat is an initially intriguing puzzle game with a striking retro visual style and a musical hook to its color-matching gameplay. This challenging and enjoyable Vita exclusive has all of the fundamental qualities of a sleeper hit--but ultimately hits a bit of a flat note.', 'Magical Beat is a falling-block game with a rhythm-based twist. While this description probably brings to mind the beloved puzzler Lumines, Magical Beat is quite distinct from that game in several ways. For starters, gameplay is always done in versus format, pitting you against either a human or a CPU-controlled foe. The object is to match up chains of three or more colored, anthropomorphic blocks called ""beatons"" in any combination of vertical or horizontal directions to send attacks over to your foe. Unlike most puzzlers of this sort, the blocks don\'t fall on their own: you rotate and move them above the field to your liking before pressing a button to drop them directly into the field.', ""It's that part about dropping them of your own volition that helps set Magical Beat apart from the pack. As you play, a meter with a small bar inside of it sits alongside the field, and the bar shifts up and down in tandem with the stage's soundtrack. To successfully drop your pieces onto the field, you must press the button when the bar is within the blue area at the meter's center. Do this, and your pieces successfully drop; fail, and the beaton pieces break apart and fall in random places. Watching the meter itself is something of a hindrance, however. Instead, you should pay careful attention to the beats of the song, dropping your pieces when you hear the appropriate sound cues."", ""To beat your opponents, you need to be aggressive, creating combos and giant chains of same-colored beatons. There's a delay, as in Lumines, before the same-colored blocks you match up actually disappear from the playfield, allowing you a few precious seconds of time to set up a few more three-or-more chains of beatons before they all vanish. Unlike in Lumines, however, there's no visual cue for when the pieces will vanish from the field, meaning you need to pay extra attention to the music to get a sense of how long you have to create chains. The more chains you make--and the larger the clusters of eliminated beatons are--before they vanish, the more field-obstructing crud drops on your foe's side of the screen. If said junk piles up beyond the top of the arena, you win."", ""The drop restrictions and the hard time limit for combos combine to create a challenging--but fun--puzzle game that requires you to not only be quick with pattern identification and decision-making, but also have a keen ear for timing. You also can't go straight into panic mode when you notice one column of beatons growing dangerously high, lest you drop offbeat and wind up making your problems even worse."", ""While the game feels great once you get the hang of it, the learning curve is unforgiving; the tutorial is limited, and the difficulty of opponents ramps up quickly. One of the game's scant few options allows you to turn off the beaton-breaking penalty for dropping a piece offbeat, and though it does make the game considerably easier, it robs it of a quality that helps make it unique, turning it into just another fairly standard puzzle game."", 'You can\'t have a music-heavy game without a solid soundtrack, and fortunately, Magical Beat delivers on this front. There\'s a good variety of music offered of varying speeds and styles, and the speed of a stage\'s backing track can have a noticeable effect on gameplay. Many of the songs share a common trait: the use of Vocaloid synthesized vocals, the same technology behind Hatsune Miku. (In fact, if you\'re familiar with Miku\'s distinct ""voice,"" you\'ll immediately recognize her in some of the tracks.) The songs are charming and catchy, and combined with the cute sprite graphics, they help create an upbeat, cheery atmosphere for fierce puzzle fighting. But even if the initial soundtrack isn\'t up your alley, beating the game once lets you play on stages featuring hard-rock tracks from Arc System Works\' popular fighting games BlazBlue and Guilty Gear.', ""Unfortunately, that's about the full extent of interesting extra content in Magical Beat. The game features three single-player modes of ascending difficulty, each featuring a typical arcade-style progression of foes until you reach and beat the final enemy. There's no story or dialogue to speak of, just a parade of cute-looking characters whose fields you valiantly attempt to fill with junk. A fourth single-player mode allows you to pick your desired music and opponent difficulty for a single match. That's basically all there is for the solo experience; you can play as every character in normal to earn some bronze trophies, but even that isn't a terribly interesting incentive to stick with Magical Beat. A dedicated, non-versus single-player mode could have been a great addition to the package, but unfortunately, you won't find it here."", ""Multiplayer is where Magical Beat would theoretically shine brightest, and gameplay certainly does get quite fevered playing against a human opponent, provided you're OK with a limited set of match-creation options. On top of that, you can only fight local opponents; there's no online functionality built into the game. This makes finding competition significantly more challenging, and makes the already bare-bones versus mode look even more anemic. Yes, you can use a workaround like AdHoc Party to get past this limitation, but it seems ridiculous to need to do that for a competitive game in this day and age."", ""Magical Beat, while cleverly designed and audiovisually charming, feels stripped down. The game lacks the sorts of options and modes that help elevate a standard puzzle game to the level of cherished time-killer and competitive classic. Though a handful of nifty unlockables make for fun fan service, they don't add much to the threadbare single- and multiplayer modes. It's a real shame that this cute concert feels like it's over before it has barely started.""]"Josiah Renaudin,24-Jun-14,EA Sports UFC Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ea-sports-ufc-review/1900-6415802/,5,PS4,"[""If you based quality strictly on appearance, EA Sports UFC could be a lock for the top spot, because EA Canada's first crack at a mixed martial arts project captures the atmosphere of a real event. Hard liver shots mirror a pebble being thrown into a still pond, the impact causing skin to ripple across the body. Bruises and cuts form and worsen over the course of a fight, and veins bulge as fighters desperately work to break out of tight guillotine chokes."", ""It's beautiful violence, but once you grab a controller, the wonder of the gorgeous character models and stomach-churning thuds of punches and kicks quickly wears off. That's because one of the most essential elements of the sport is almost nonexistent inside this virtual Octagon: tension. Where THQ's UFC series allowed each moment of a fight to seem equally dangerous for both combatants, EA Sports UFC's poor balancing makes the moment-to-moment action feel too safe, too often. Vicious knees that would send even the most granite-chinned veteran tumbling to the canvas often land without much effect, and while a fully mounted position on the ground tends to result in either a stoppage or easily won round in real MMA, single-button escapes cause dominant positions to feel flimsy."", ""Each fight in EA Sports UFC starts on the feet, and for the most part, that's where they stay. The stand-up game--despite its preference for flash over finishing power--is the best way to play. Jumping off the cage and landing flush with a flying knee is devilishly satisfying, while parrying a jab and answering with a devastating overhand-right is enough to get you out of your seat. It can take quite a bit of work to end a fight, but individual animations, whether you're throwing bombs standing up or transitioning on the ground, look natural. If all you want to do is meet in the center of the Octagon, bite down on your mouthpiece, and swing until someone's lights go out, you're at least rewarded with proper hit detection and satisfying contact."", ""Frankly, it's just about the only way the AI and most online players care to engage. That's because there's no venom in a strong wrestling-based attack. A real fighter rarely flips his opponent over while pinned on his back to land into a prevailing mount, but it happens frequently in EA Sports UFC. Reversing someone who just worked hard to drag you to the mat and trap you in a bad spot shouldn't come from a few swift rotations of the right stick, and while I'd love to be able to move into side control and dig a few well-placed knees in the midsection of another fighter, it's often too difficult to hold anyone down long enough to produce any significant offense."", ""The grappling game is muted for the most part, but submissions can be a viable option. If you can reach and maintain a dominant position, grabbing a limb or your opponent's neck leads to a minigame that determines the success of a technique. A giant octagon appears on the screen as the defending fighter looks to push one of the four corners far enough to break the hold, while the jiu-jitsu practitioner fights to hyperextend the limb to force a tap. Stamina, along with the individual fighter's skill with a particular move, determines each scramble's success, and if you can actually stay on the ground long enough to find an opening, submissions are a valuable weapon."", ""Baffling design decisions aren't exclusive to the offensive side of the game, either. Players can slip and parry punches, but when it comes to blocking strikes, holding a single button stops high, middle, and low blows. Fighters can't regain stamina when in a defensive stance, making it unwise to continually hold your hands up to defend your noggin. Yet the lack of multiple levels of blocking reduces the effectiveness of intelligent combinations. Throwing a flurry of low kicks, digging into the body, and then surprising your foe with a fight-ending head kick is a strategy that often works in both real MMA and THQ's Undisputed series, but unless your dance partner decides to let go of the block button, all of these strikes in UFC are too easily blocked."", 'A real fighter rarely flips his opponent over while pinned on his back to land into a prevailing mount, but it happens constantly in EA Sports UFC.', ""The AI isn't exactly defense-minded, so standing and banging is an almost surefire method for success. I managed to capture the lightweight title by knocking out each contender in the first round while playing through the game's career mode, which throws your customized character into the Ultimate Fighter reality series and follows him to the end of his career. Without fail, I walked to the center of the cage, blocked incoming strikes, threw heavy leather whenever there was an opening, and ended the fight without the need for judges. I never lost a single fight, and this was all on the game's hard mode."", 'Starting as an untested prospect and fighting your way to the top might sound like an appealing single-player offering, but unfortunately, climbing the ladder is a slog. Training camps between individual fights are padded with dull training exercises and awkward video clips from real-life fighters. Current stars of the UFC patting you on the back in between fights comes off as both gimmicky and unnecessary, and while it can be fun to improve both your stats and your stockpile of techniques, the tutorial-esque drilling sessions are an uninspired chore.', ""Online play is your best bet for competitive, interesting matches. I experienced only brief periods of lag over the course of more than 30 fights, and while I still rarely saw opposition shoot in for a takedown, there was at least a bit more diversity inside the cage. The career and online modes are the meat and potatoes of the experience, and it's not exactly a filling dish."", ""The graphical foundation is in place, but there are too many flawed combat systems to call this a strong debut for what's sure to be an annualized series. EA Sports UFC manages to make only certain aspects of MMA both fun and functional, forcing most fights to play out in a familiar, brawling fashion. Even if you do enjoy swinging for the fences, there's just not enough content here to justify the full retail price. It might look the part of a world champion, but EA Sports UFC will need a great deal of fine-tuning before it's up to snuff.""]"Cameron Woolsey,24-Jun-14,Blood of the Werewolf Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/blood-of-the-werewolf-review/1900-6415803/,8,Xbox 360,"['It has been some time since werewolf Selena first set off on her adventure. Hers was a journey of vengeance as she sought revenge on Dr. Frankenstein and his movie monster cohorts for the murder of her husband and the kidnapping of her son. Blood of the Werewolf was a wildly entertaining 2D action platformer, as beautiful as it was punishing. A few gameplay foibles, however, kept it from reaching greatness. But time can mend most wounds. Nearly eight months have passed since it hit the PC, and the game has made it onto the Xbox 360 in spectacular fashion--smoother and tighter than ever.', ""Most notably, Blood of the Werewolf's difficulty curve has been smoothed out. The occasional difficulty jumps--notably with the timing of the ruthless smashers early in the game--have been ironed out, making the rise in challenge feel more organic. But though the difficulty has been tuned up, don't believe for a second that the game has been defanged. This is still Blood of the Werewolf, after all, and it is maliciously designed to toss you into the mouth of death any chance it gets."", ""Ten stages stand between Selena and her confrontation with Dr. Frankenstein. Contained within are jagged spikes, whirling saw blades, fireball-spewing lava, and supernatural beasts such as vampires, ghouls, and skeleton archers. The game keeps you on your toes: platforms crumble at your feet as bats zip toward you, threatening to knock you out of the air and into the abyss below. Countless times I watched my life get snatched away just as I neared a room's exit. And more than once I had to momentarily stop playing to collect myself by yelling various profanities at the ceiling."", ""But while the game is difficult, it is not completely unforgiving. There is no set life count, and checkpoints are located throughout each level, many of which lie just beyond a deadly trap. Respawning at checkpoints replenishes your health and ability meters, removing some of death's sting. Scattered throughout the stages are also sigils, which increase your health after enough are collected, giving you a better chance of staying alive long enough to reach the next checkpoint. The platforming mechanics are fantastic, and in fact, the game feels better than it did before. In my initial run with Blood of the Werewolf, I lamented the times when Selena would drop off a platform if she landed on the edge. I didn't encounter this phenomenon even once as I played the game on the console. Every time I died, it was due to my own inability to complete a room, and not from faulty mechanics."", 'The occasional difficulty jumps--notably with the timing of the ruthless smashers early in the game--have been ironed out, making the rise in challenge feel more organic.', ""Blood of the Werewolf separates itself from many other platformers by offering two different ways to play its story. Selena is a lycanthrope of folklore, able to shape-shift into a massive werewolf when blessed by the moon's power. She remains in human form so long as she has a roof overhead, using a crossbow to tackle mythical monsters as well as activate various switches and levers. In her more powerful werewolf form, Selena uses her teeth to tear enemies such as harpies to shreds, while benefitting from her enhanced agility to double jump across gaping chasms."", ""The abilities of each of her two forms are bolstered with special power-ups you collect along the way. Selena's crossbow gets upgraded to shoot arrows that split, causing extra damage, or arrows ignited by fire, which work wonders against shuffling zombies. Powers she collects in her werewolf form include a rush attack and an ability to fire off charged energy, great for blasting foes from a distance. She may also howl at the moon to regain some health, a vital power that saved my wolf hide in many white-knuckled boss fights."", ""Throughout the game, you fight boss monsters straight out of classic Hollywood horror films. You tangle with the likes of Mr. Hyde and later dodge snaking waves of purple energy while trading blows with Dracula. Most battles have you shift between Selena's two different forms, forcing you to switch up your play style. The boss fights are challenging, and the key to winning is your ability to watch and learn each enemy's unique patterns and then strike when his or her guard is down. It can take multiple tries and a load of patience, but that only makes the eventual victory all the sweeter."", ""Once you finish with the story, you can try out the game's extra content. Score Rush includes 10 stages where you must collect as many point as possible while keeping the clock from running down. If you're feeling especially masochistic, you can try Endless Challenge, which pits you against room after room of vile beasts, burning jets of fire, and instant-kill spike walls. Finally, you can check out the bestiary, which provides the history behind the many monsters that haunt the game, as well as the myths that inspired their creation."", 'You tangle with the likes of Mr. Hyde and later dodge snaking waves of purple energy while trading blows with Dracula.', 'When I wrote the initial review of Blood of the Werewolf, I mentioned my disappointment with the ending. I noted that it ""emits more of a whimper than a howl,"" but not just because I was writing about werewolves and wanted to sound clever. The game\'s ending rang hollow and bittersweet considering the hours of abuse that paved the road to get there. Thankfully, better gameplay wasn\'t all the developer focused on with the game\'s second release. Blood of the Werewolf has received an expanded ending, which provides a better summary while hinting upon surprising revelations in Selena\'s future. With the fixes and gameplay mechanics, what remains is Blood of the Werewolf in its finest form: enjoyable, challenging, and, at long last, satisfying to the very end. Dreadful traps and Hollywood\'s most famous monsters stand in your way.

A move to consoles two years later hasn't changed much about the source material. The blob still responds beautifully to your commands, and the design still feels fresh, but there are some disappointing new issues too."", ""This is in many respects a straight port, with necessary adjustments to bring it to a larger viewing surface and some tweaks to puzzles where they make sense. The game still begins as you, represented by a little blob of jelly with attitude (note the spikes), escape a cage and begin terrorizing a scientific research building. During the platforming stages that follow, the unnamed goop slides, hops, and even flies through mostly sterile environments populated by lab equipment, security systems, picnicking astronauts, whales, and tasty civilians. The whole time, it consumes anything smaller than itself, until eventually there's not much left that qualifies. As in the PlayStation 2 classic Katamari Damacy, backtracking to old obstacles and adding them to your own mass feels joyful."", ""Mutant Blobs Attack boasts an attractive art style that wouldn't have been out of place in magazine and billboard ads during the '50s. There's a washed-out look to a lot of it, with little splashes of color that mostly center around the antihero you control and the food he can consume. On the Vita's screen, the aesthetic was especially lovely, and it looks terrific now even on a substantially larger display. The kooky soundtrack works as nicely coming from television speakers as it does a handheld unit, and the cutscenes between stages remain adorable."", ""Unfortunately, the game's control scheme didn't translate as well as its audiovisual components. The blob itself performs admirably, and he possesses abilities that allow you to also manipulate the environment to solve puzzles. Not much precision is required in the early going, and there aren't major penalties if you make a mistake (especially since the developers were smart and placed frequent checkpoints throughout every stage so that you never have to tackle more than one challenge at a time), but the puzzle design in later stages grows more devious, and it's easy to get fatally fried by a laser even when you know what you're expected to do to survive."", 'Backtracking to old obstacles and adding them to your own mass feels joyful.', ""In one case, for instance, you need to cross a wide area with laser beams serving as its base. The way to accomplish that task is to manipulate a series of four floating, C-shaped platforms. You can press shoulder buttons to toggle which one you are trying to manipulate, and moving the right analog stick then allows you to direct the architecture's movement via telekinesis. Unfortunately, it's all too easy to start moving the wrong piece at the wrong time, and that's fatal for the ball of goop in your charge."", ""Other situations might find you rotating giant wheels while the blob works through them. On the Vita, this was again handled with finger slides and felt natural. With a controller's analog stick, environmental responses to your commands are often jerky. Gears and turrets either barely adjust or move with such gusto that you accidentally squash your otherwise resilient character. Nearly effortless precision is a thing of the past. It was easy to take for granted, and now it's gone."", 'Bonus stages also provide less of a thrill, now that you interact with them by way of a new control scheme. The stages take place from a top-down perspective. Previously, you would tilt the Vita to direct the path the slime followed as it slid through the environment, scarfing down objects and quickly gaining mass. Sometimes you also had to swipe along the screen to manipulate barriers. Here, all you have to do is tilt the analog stick and the barriers are absent. The challenge is gone too, and with it much of the satisfaction that came from surviving another minigame interlude.', ""Tales From Space: Mutant Blobs Attack was and still is an enjoyable platformer, regardless of the device on which you play it, but it's difficult to recommend this new release to anyone who already has access to the superior Vita rendition. The attractive aesthetic and the light puzzle elements that made the original release worthwhile have returned mostly unscathed, but the control limitations this time around hurt the experience, and that's a shame. Hopefully, vengeful slimes everywhere will forgive the developers the infraction.""]"Carolyn Petit,24-Jun-14,Valiant Hearts: The Great War Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/valiant-hearts-the-great-war-review/1900-6415800/,8,PC,"[""Valiant Hearts: The Great War is one of the most human and sensitive games about war ever released. Set during World War I, the game is more about the personal struggles of its characters than it is about the larger historical details and political realities of the devastating conflict. It takes a few small missteps, but the game successfully couches grim truths in a story with endearing characters, gorgeous art, and moments of jubilance and adventure, making its tale about how war destroys lives accessible and appealing to players of all ages while still giving the war's tremendous human cost the acknowledgment it deserves."", ""The game begins by making it clear that this isn't a simple tale of good vs. evil. Karl is a German citizen living in France with his wife and newborn son, but as the war breaks out, Karl is forcibly separated from his family and sent back to Germany, where he must join the war effort. Meanwhile, his father-in-law, Emile, is conscripted into the French forces. Neither of them are motivated to enlist or fight; rather, as is so often the case in war, they are ordinary people who are swept up in conflicts beyond their control."", ""Over the course of the game, you play as both Emile and Karl, as well as a Belgian nurse named Anna and an American named Freddie who enlists with the French forces. These characters aren't traditional action heroes; the older Emile, for instance, has to scramble and struggle a bit to hoist himself over obstacles, and instead of running and gunning their way through the game's side-scrolling stages, characters solve a series of environmental puzzles to proceed."", ""These puzzles cleverly find many different ways to combine simple elements like tossing objects to distract enemies, pulling levers to activate machinery, and issuing commands to your devoted canine companion, Walt, and they're just challenging enough to be engaging and satisfying, without being so difficult as to interfere with the story's momentum. And throughout the stages, you can find collectibles that shed light on the historical realities of the war, illuminating the miserable conditions soldiers engaging in trench warfare had to live with, for instance, or the ways that the war affected the rights and workplace responsibilities of women."", ""There's a lot of death in Valiant Hearts, but very little direct violence. You do occasionally have to clobber an unsuspecting enemy soldier from behind, and you may blast a few planes out of the sky in one sequence, but most of your time is spent helping people rather than attacking them. You provide first aid to the wounded, rescue people trapped in buildings, and give a soldier a nice, clean pair of socks. In this game, you are not a killing machine. The war itself is. There's an appropriate feeling of futility that comes from charging into battle again and again and seeing soldiers on both sides fall in droves to artillery blasts and machine-gun fire. Things become increasingly grim as the game and the war progress, and a late-game stage set during the hopeless Nivelle Offensive is particularly hellish."", ""It's not all grimness and death, thankfully. There are scenes of beauty, too, like a sequence that takes place on a starry night in Paris just as the war is beginning. Here, you play as the headstrong and capable Anna, a wonderful character who is determined to do whatever she can to help people during the war. After performing some quick automotive repairs, you drive down the city's bustling streets in a joyous scene during which you avoid cars and other obstacles in keeping with the music."", ""Beautiful moments like this keep the tone of the game from falling into monotony, and make the devastation of the game's grimmer scenes more impactful. Not long after you leave the beauty of Paris behind, you're in the Belgian town of Ypres, where the sky is filled not with shimmering stars but with toxic gas. Reinforcing the fact that lives on one side aren't worth more or less than lives on the other, Anna rushes to assist any injured soul she comes across, no matter the uniform he might be wearing."", ""Though the mechanics are simple, Valiant Hearts admirably puts you in a wonderful variety of situations, having you do everything from cooking a meal for a high-ranking officer to fighting a boss battle against a zeppelin using a pipe organ as your weapon. No matter what you're doing, the game's art style pulls you in. There are always wonderful details in the background to give the scenarios life. In one scene set in a POW camp, for instance, you see a prisoner being intensely interrogated in the window of one building, while in a nearby structure, French soldiers carouse and listen to music as their prisoners suffer. Through it all, the endearing designs of the characters, with their eyes charmingly obscured by their hair, make it easy to care about them and their struggles."", 'The game\'s storytelling isn\'t always as cohesive as it should be. There\'s a jarring disconnect between the French-accented voice we hear Emile use during gameplay and the British-accented voice that speaks for him during between-level cutscenes. Freddie\'s storyline fits too neatly into the familiar narrative trope of a man out for revenge against the person responsible for the death of the woman he loved, making his arc feel more like something out of a generic action movie than a proper tale of war. And on multiple occasions, the game leads you to think a dire fate has befallen one or more characters, only to reveal, like the bad resolution of a TV cliff-hanger, that this wasn\'t the case. But these are minor blemishes on a visually beautiful game that deftly moves between moments of joy and moments of tragedy, and ultimately doesn\'t shy away from the fact that ""great"" is just about the last thing any war should be called.']"John Robertson,24-Jun-14,GRID Autosport Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/grid-autosport-review/1900-6415799/,6,PC,"['The tone has changed with Grid Autosport. Gone is the raucous, obtrusive, personality-sapping hullabaloo of the poorly conceived and painfully stereotypical ""dude bro"" aesthetic that characterised Grid 2, replaced by something altogether more subtle. Here\'s a game that simply asks: what kind of racing driver do you want to be? There\'s no overarching narrative here, no attempt to coat Career mode in the kind of shallow, scrawny narrative that even the writers of Jack Reacher would be embarrassed to publish. Autosport is about the cars, the tracks, and the opponents.', ""To that end, variety and choice are placed front and centre right from the off. As with previous Grid games' Career modes, Autosport's brings together a disparate mix of event types under a single umbrella, giving you plenty of options for reaching professional racing stardom. Touring car events, street races, nighttime endurance slogs, time trial runs, and showboating drift sessions are all here and waiting to be conquered; the frequency with which you partake in any given event comes down to how you're feeling at the time."", 'These event types are split into five distinct categories that are progressed through independently of one another. The touring discipline is defined by wheel-to-wheel racing, with cars bumping into each other regularly as they attempt to race three abreast around a corner. Endurance sees you racing at night in longer races that force you to look after your tyres. Open-wheel places you in what are essentially underpowered Formula One cars (think Formula Three and Formula Renault). Tuner focuses on high-powered Japanese imports and American muscle, while street events take place on fictional circuits around famous cities.', ""At the start of each season within Career mode, you're asked to pick a discipline. Once you've completed that season, you can move on to a new discipline or stick with the same one. The promise is that once you've experienced each of the different categories, you can specialise in a single one and dedicate yourself to fully mastering it. However, doing so restricts your ability to partake in the game's most prestigious competitions."", 'Gone is the raucous, obtrusive, personality-sapping hullabaloo of the poorly conceived and painfully stereotypical ""dude bro"" aesthetic that characterised Grid 2.', ""You gain experience points for each discipline independently, but only once you've hit a certain level in all of them can you enter the Grid Championship Series events. Unfortunately, this means that in Career mode, you can't opt to play Autosport as just a street racing game or a touring car game--you must indulge in all of the career's facets at some point in order to beat it. The championship events themselves cover all of the included disciplines, so not being suitably practiced in each is a major disadvantage."", ""This represents a problem. With so many different car and race types on offer, there are sure to be one or two that you don't enjoy. Personally, I'm not a fan of the fiddly drift events or the awkward handling of the American muscle cars, but there's no way to avoid engaging with them if I want to enter and win the championship races. Portions of play, therefore, become a grind. You undertake seasons that you actually want to play, followed by working out the fastest way to level up in the events you don't like in order to unlock new content as quickly as possible."", ""As a general rule, the fastest way to earn experience points is to increase the difficulty. Setting the AI on hard, removing the racing line from the track, turning off traction control and forcing yourself to play using only the in-car cockpit cameras sees your level rise rapidly. Conversely, if you're new to racing games, then you'll want to play with assists on full (in particular, I recommended cosmetic car damage) in order to finish in a respectable position. Finishing first on the easiest difficulty settings earns you more points than finishing last using the most testing, after all."", ""No matter the difficulty setting, however, you must be open to learning how cars operate within the different disciplines. Touring cars tend to be extremely forgiving, reasonably withstanding knocks with opponents and barriers, and they let you brake late into corners and even perform small drifts without losing too much speed. In contrast, open-wheeled vehicles require more precision, because it's far easier to lose control by applying too much power too early when exiting a corner, while their more fragile chassis often mean bumps are terminal."", ""You undertake seasons that you actually want to play, followed by working out the fastest way to level up in the events you don't like in order to unlock new content as quickly as possible."", 'Make no mistake about it, though: Autosport is not a simulation racer. None of the disciplines require an enormous amount of work to get to grips with, making the game genuinely accessible and fairly simple for veteran racing game players to surmount. In particular, braking and handling are more responsive than you would expect from a real car.', ""The AI drivers feel human and diverse. Drivers have different personalities; some are daring and liable to attempt risky overtaking moves, while others drive in a more conservative manner until they've got open road in front of them. Resultantly, Autosport never suffers from a lack of drama. Almost every race sees cars hitting one another and reacting to unpredictable maneuvers, adding a sense of exaggerated tension, because you never quite know when and from where the next danger might come."", ""For touring car and street races, the AI's approach works great, making the two disciplines the most endearing and memorable of the bunch since cars are usually tightly grouped and tussling for position from start to finish. Unfortunately, for open-wheeled and endurance events, the AI is less impressive. The AI doesn't react differently across the disciplines, making races requiring finesse and precision instead feel messy. In one instance, I had to restart the same open-wheel race eight times (no exaggeration) because there was, without fail, a multiple-car pileup on the first corner thanks to one or more drivers acting too aggressively."", ""In the end, I decided that the only option was to hang back and drive across the grass to avoid trouble, losing time on the leaders but keeping my car intact. Stronger AI could have provided a more realistic front for the technical disciplines, and would have helped make each event feel more unique, limiting the instances such as this in which it's almost impossible to continue to suspend your disbelief."", ""This failing is possibly a byproduct of Autosport's exhaustive approach. There are a number of nice extra features that similar games have shied away from: split-screen multiplayer, for example, and an online component that is entirely separate from the single-player, which means there are essentially two games to progress through. Play it for a few hours, and the cracks begin to show, though. They're not game-breaking, but they are abrasive, and they dull the shine of the early portions of the game. If you're up for some casual racing, Autosport is a decent option, but when you go deep, the experience is soured by the finer details.""]"Shaun McInnis,23-Jun-14,The Elder Scrolls Online Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-elder-scrolls-online-review-familiar-world-str/1900-6415797/,6,PC,"[""As a fan of role-playing games and open-world sandboxes, I've long held a special place in my heart for the Elder Scrolls franchise. Since I was first introduced to the series with Morrowind back in 2002, I've spent countless hours exploring Bethesda's immense fantasy worlds in search of loot, adventure, and gorgeous views of the surrounding landscapes. It's that love for the series that inspired me to spend time with The Elder Scrolls Online despite one very embarrassing shortcoming in my gaming career: I had never played a massively multiplayer online game before, or at least not for any significant length of time."", ""I honestly couldn't tell you why that was. There's nothing about MMO games that I necessarily dislike; I just tend to prefer the freedom of solo adventuring over group raids and guild life. But I'm happy that I gave the genre a shot, because after 40 or so hours in The Elder Scrolls Online, I rather liked--though not exactly loved--my time with the game."", ""Much of that appreciation stems from the overall feel of the world. The Elder Scrolls Online does a great job of capturing the joy of existing within Tamriel, all those sights and sounds that make up a vibrant fantasy setting. My journey began on the bustling medieval streets of Daggerfall, though I quickly found myself exploring the windswept sand dunes of Stros M'Kai, the eerie swampland of the Glenumbra Moors, and the picturesque coastline of Stormhaven. And those are just some of the early-level areas. Even as I proceeded across the world map toward more challenging sections of Tamriel, I always felt like there was some fresh chunk of terrain to explore or some beautiful vista to take in."", ' ', ""The Elder Scrolls Online goes out of its way to immerse you in its world. It's not just the geographical diversity, either. A lush soundtrack provides a stirring backdrop to your adventuring, and a fully voiced collection of non-player characters bring each city and backwater hamlet to life. Sure, there are echoes of Oblivion in the repetition of voice actors, and the dialogue can feel a bit wooden at times, but the overall presentation goes a long way toward delivering a world full of characters rather than quest-giving cardboard cutouts."", 'The Elder Scrolls Online does a great job of capturing the joy of existing within Tamriel, all those sights and sounds that make up a vibrant fantasy setting.', ""And yet, throughout all my travels, I always felt a vague longing for the serendipitous discoveries of earlier Elder Scrolls games. Enemies always respawn in the same place, and there are no hidden cabins full of clutter to rummage through, no armor waiting to be discovered at the bottom of some lake--this just isn't a game that gives you much of a reason to wander off the beaten path."", ""That's something that took a while for me to come to terms with. The unpredictable exploration of Elder Scrolls games has always been one of my favorite trademarks of the series. The Elder Scrolls Online does give you plenty of interesting enemies to tangle with and the occasional treasure chest to happen upon, but compared to a game like Skyrim with all its environmental storytelling and unpredictable encounters, the world feels static. It's a beautiful place, but a sterile one."", ""So while I struggled to create my own adventures, The Elder Scrolls Online had plenty of its own exciting tales to tell. Rarely do its quests feel like tedious fluff; quite often, you're asked to navigate labyrinthine stories of backstabbing and political intrigue, fantastical creatures and bloodthirsty cultists, or cursed souls and tormented dreamworlds. What makes these quests interesting is that they're often complex, multipart sagas. You might take on the task of rescuing a kidnapped duke only to find yourself embarking on a murder mystery involving scheming werewolves, supernatural rituals, and the ripple effects of time travel."", ""The best quests are the ones that use just enough of the series' established lore to paint a vivid picture of the task at hand, though there are some--like the messy and ultimately forgettable main storyline--that tend to resemble overzealous fan fiction. But such missteps are infrequent and easy to forgive; for the most part, The Elder Scrolls Online delivers a broad and engaging collection of tales that mesh nicely with its fantasy landscape."", ""If only they meshed better with the game's fundamental structure. I lost track of how many times I was called upon to perform the esoteric tasks necessary to unseal some long-forgotten chamber, only to discover a parade of player-controlled characters already running about within. These are moments when the quest design and multiplayer nature of the game butt heads, taking any sense of immersion the game might have established and hurling it out the window."", ""It's a shame, because there are some good group quests available in The Elder Scrolls Online--they're just more the exception than the rule. Some of the most fun I had in the game was teaming up with a group of strangers to make it through the harrowing gauntlet known as Spindleclutch, a creepy dungeon with a relentless assault of arachnid enemies and one very imposing boss fight. But it's rare that The Elder Scrolls Online takes full advantage of its multiplayer structure. Most of my interactions with other players were simply running by them out in the wild, like two ships passing in the night who might occasionally team up to kill a trio of bandits."", 'There is a guild system, of course, but in my experience it felt more useful as an economic tool than a means for players to come together as a team. With no auction house, guilds are what allow you to trade items with one another. As a result, you tend to see a lot of guilds that players have forgotten about once their barter is complete--making it tough to find the truly active ones.', ""It's rare that The Elder Scrolls Online takes full advantage of its multiplayer structure."", ""And so, without much of a meaningful connection to the player population around me, I often found myself defaulting to my old Elder Scrolls ways of wandering alone like some wayward ronin. But don't pity me too much. I was perfectly happy to keep plugging away, leveling up my dragonknight one quest at a time. The Elder Scrolls Online gives you a deep and flexible progression system, one that allows you to tinker around with different builds without ever feeling like you've completely pigeonholed yourself. After beginning the game as a brutish damage-sponge of a tank, I found myself gravitating toward more of a hybrid role where I balanced my sword-and-shield tactics with elemental spells and defensive powers. With a broad selection of active and passive abilities--the former of which can evolve in interesting ways as you level them up--there's a lot of room to mess around with your chosen style."", ""Those abilities go a long way toward enhancing the combat, which at its core is nothing remarkable. Sure, I enjoyed using my shield bash to stun an enemy mid-cast so that I could knock him to the ground with a powerful heavy attack. But most melee strikes feel limp and sluggish. Layer in those abilities, though, and battles feel a little more lively. I never tired of seeing flaming spikes burst from my character's back as I triggered my razor armor ability, then closing the gap on a distant foe by dashing toward him with a quick and devastating shield charge. Factor in the game's propensity for generous and meaningful loot drops, and I rarely skipped the chance to take on some new group of enemies."", ""So most of my enjoyment with The Elder Scrolls Online came not from its MMO structure, but from its decent approximation of the games that came before it--that sense of wayward adventure, of gazing out at beautiful landscapes as you explore a lively fantasy world. But for as much as it struggles to reconcile its single-player heritage and multiplayer ambitions, there is one area that makes an awfully convincing argument for its status as an MMO game, and that's player-versus-player combat."", ""Having never spent any significant amount of time with an MMO before, I went into The Elder Scrolls Online's PvP expecting some form of arena combat--perhaps a matchmaking system that pitted a handful of players from the Daggerfall Covenant against another handful from the Ebonheart Pact. What I found was something much more complex and fascinating."", ""PvP in The Elder Scrolls Online turns the whole of Cyrodiil into one great big board game, a giant web full of keeps and strongholds that you are constantly fighting for control over. There are resources to consider, siege weapons to employ, and all manner of strategic possibilities. It's a great showcase for the game's combat, which becomes much more exciting when you're pairing complementary abilities together as a team."", ""But there is one flaw to the scope of the PvP, which is that the map is too big for its own good. Combat was exciting when I could get to it, but I found myself spending the vast majority of my time simply getting from one place to another. I can handle and even enjoy riding around on horseback for 10 straight minutes while questing, but when I'm doing it over and over again each time I die in a pitched multiplayer battle, it becomes tedious."", ""And that's The Elder Scrolls Online right there: a game that does a lot of things well, but stumbles to get the most out of them. In the end, I was happy to spend time in this version of Tamriel, but it just wasn't the gateway into the MMO genre that I hoped it would be.""]"Cameron Woolsey,23-Jun-14,Nether Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/nether-review/1900-6415798/,5,PC,"[""The popularity of postapocalyptic survival games has been explosive, and it has become increasingly critical to offer a fresh take or risk being lost in the bedlam. Nether, however, is a first-person online survival shooter that doesn't strive to reinvent the wheel. It approaches the challenge by introducing tried-and-true ideas, mashing them together in hopes that the sum of its acclimated parts results in a bright entry in the well-trodden genre. What emerges is a concoction that vacillates between amusement and listlessness. Nether employs many ideas that, alone, could have produced enjoyable gameplay, but what ultimately surfaces is a game whose fun, interesting moments are undermined by frustration."", 'Nether exhibits influences from popular postapocalyptic television shows and films. The Chicago-inspired urban sprawl of the city portions of the game are home to cracked, ruined skyscrapers and flooded streets. Vehicles, covered in rust and abandoned by their owners, litter enormous freeways in a scene that could have been plucked from early advertisements for The Walking Dead. Scattered throughout the world are safe zones, hastily erected out of metal barriers or standing high on platforms. Final bastions of humankind, safe zones are places similar to the cobbled structures seen in films like The Day of the Dead. Here, you are safe from harm (mostly, but more on that later) and can buy and sell gear, craft weapons, and complete courier missions.', ""Despite the familiar world in which Nether exists, I found the varied urban environments the highlight of my forlorn adventures. As is the custom of survival games, you are released into the desolate world of Nether, where you're greeted by ruined buildings and charred skeletons. No explanation behind the tragedy is freely offered, only a large kitchen knife and a lime-green backpack, the latter of which does little to assist you in blending into the brown and gray of the decayed urban landscape. Scattered throughout the broken concrete world are signs of the desperation that soon followed whatever unearthly disaster occurred years prior. Emergency vehicles sit dormant, their flashing lights cutting through the dust and fog."", 'Elsewhere lay signs that people had attempted to carve out an existence, either in peaceful solitude or in ruthless, violent gangs--both of which ultimately met a macabre and bloody demise. The world is bleak, dark, often gorgeous, and well realized. I embraced the excitement and apprehension as I darted into buildings or sprinted over dangerous, empty streets while scrounging for food or gear locked away in various objects such as vending machines or abandoned vehicles. Some minor gripes include buildings that are clearly copied and pasted, and structures that cannot be entered.', ""But those issues don't hamper the entertainment much. Adding to the interest is the ambient weather system, which can influence how you approach situations. More than once, I would scout an area I needed to visit. I noted pathways to keep me hidden, along with enemies to avoid. But suddenly a cloud of rust-colored dust would roll in, and the loss of vision would force me to drastically alter my advancement. Nether's fluctuating world feels like a living entity, always plotting against you."", ""It's unfortunate that the immersion is so often broken by nagging issues, coupled with the reality of Nether's clearly unfinished state. Oddly placed invisible walls stop you short mid-sprint, which makes pacing anything but fluid. Piles of rubble and trash are commonplace, which is not strange considering the game's motif. What is odd, however, are the invisible barriers surrounding the debris. Walking over the piles is possible, though doing so positions you several feet in the air. Your movement speed is also drastically slowed in these situations, turning you into an easy target for predators. It is also possible to clip completely into certain objects, such as cabinets, computer desks, or rubble, as well as some knee-high gates, as if they weren't even there. The fields west of the city may seem like a respite from such urban difficulties, but they are nearly barren and devoid of food and resources--save for the military grain silo, a popular site for random weapon spawns. There are towers to capture if you're part of a clan, as well as safe zones to which you can transport packages. I found myself avoiding the area completely and sticking to the more interesting urban locations."", 'Scattered throughout the broken concrete world are signs of the desperation that soon followed whatever unearthly disaster occurred years prior.', 'The creatures that populate the world following the collapse of society are the titular nethers. These mutated abominations come in many forms and charge with sharp claws, blunt fists, or blinding toxic sludge. Running is not always an option, because the monsters possess the ability to dive into a portal, exiting just behind your back and slashing away at you. These abilities make nethers more threatening than the average shuffling zombie. But some of the danger they pose also comes from their hypersensitive threat detection.', 'Nethers have the uncanny ability to ""sense"" you through stone, asphalt, and metal. You might believe you\'re alone as you move through an empty building, but suddenly a deafening screech informs you that a nether is on your tail. It can get frustrating, especially if you\'re being careful not to get spotted while you go about your current goal, whether it\'s traveling to a location or searching around for loot. Killing the creatures makes them drop organic parts such as blood or claws, which can then be sold or traded at the Order of the Cull, a mysterious group that exchanges nether viscera for gear. The order can also craft weapons from nether bones, once you gather enough severed parts.', 'More dangerous than the nethers are the human players who populate the world with you. Encounters with players are rarely analogous to those in other survival games such as DayZ, where you can consider teaming up with people, or tie them up and force-feed them any noxious chemicals in the area if you\'re feeling especially sadistic. But there is still a chance for a budding friendship in that harsh world. Not once, however, in my entire 30-hour run in Nether did I experience a confrontation that did not result in one player trying to immediately kill another; the game is the epitome of the ""kill or be killed"" axiom. Especially frustrating are times when snipers camp just outside the protective sphere surrounding safe zones and pick off players just as their protection timer reaches zero. Shouting ""friendly,"" the multiplayer-game-wide attempt at offering an olive branch of peace, is generally rewarded with a hail of gunfire. Camaraderie is rarely experienced, even during in-game missions.', ""On occasion, Nether starts a timed mission and places you randomly on the map. You receive periodic warnings of a nether surge in need of clearing or an escort package to deliver. The game's version of a boss, the nether reaper, a massive and shockingly fast beast, also appears at times, providing a challenge for veteran players or groups. If you join a clan, you can take out one of many strategically placed clan strongholds in a mode that mimic's Battlefield 4's Conquest mode. These missions can put Nether experts through their paces, and the game suggests grouping up to complete them. Unless you play with friends, or manage to band a small team together, however, players' general proclivity toward violence in Nether makes working collectively to complete missions difficult."", ""It's unfortunate that the immersion is so often broken by nagging issues, coupled with the reality of Nether's clearly unfinished state."", 'Worst of all are the times defenses in safe zones drop and you must reactivate pieces of machinery to get them back up. The game, it seems, expects players to work together in this dire time of need. But with defenses gone, people are free to shoot each other indiscriminately. So you can get where this is leading. Only once in several instances did I witness players working together with the goal of reviving the safe zone. Every other time was a massacre, and only the smartest (or fastest) players were able to get out before being gunned down.', ""I found that having enough people in a server was necessary for enjoyment, however. Sure, a fellow player who offers a friendly wave in a safe zone might later greet you with that hand tightly wrapped around the grip of a gun. But without the tension that can only be delivered by random encounters with actual living players, the game devolves into a long and uneventful trek through austere scenery. I enjoyed exploring the game's environments, but I eventually got bored and went on the hunt for populated servers when the one I inhabited began to droop."", 'To survive in the hostile world of Nether, you must equip yourself with the proper tools. Guns and melee weapons are not in short supply, though the former requires you to collect parts. Weapon parts, such as grips, barrels, and scopes, are found in containers located in the environment. When the parts are gathered, you can take them to a weapon crafter in any of the safe zones, where your brand-new gun will be assembled for free. Nether sports a wide variety of guns, from the always reliable 9mm Smith & Risley pistol, to a diverse selection of rifles and shotguns.', 'You start out with a basic knife, but to face tougher enemies, a stronger melee weapon is crucial. Melee weapons are sometimes found intact in some containers, but I was partial to purchasing them for a reasonable fee. Close-range combat is enjoyable, and you can feel the weight behind each swing of a machete or baseball bat. But guns are on the opposite end of the spectrum. They are powerful, but far too accurate, and they demonstrate next to nothing in the way of recoil. The guns bear more resemblance to weapons found in arena shooters, and fired bullets can be dodged by jumping around like a rabbit--a tactic adopted by veteran Nether players.', ""Completing missions and delivering packages awards you with cash and experience points. The experience points are used to bolster specific skills, such as stamina, accuracy, or melee damage. The game also awards you with a cash and experience point booster for every half an hour you're alive. And as is par for the course, rising in level is another joy that Nether likes to snatch away. Dying takes you back down to zero, which adds a lot of pressure the higher your level climbs. Going from level 25 back down to zero is frustrating, but luckily leveling up doesn't take much time. However, the constant sting of progression loss begins to have a numbing effect, and earning levels is quickly deprived of any gratification. You also have an account level, which isn't lost at death, but it advances far more slowly; I managed about one level per two hours. The account level adds permanent status boosters, and offers cash bonuses."", 'Only once in several instances did I witness players working together with the goal of reviving the safe zone.', ""Money can be spent on gear or food, or on cosmetic items such as masks, some of which pay homage to pop culture icons. Nether also includes a system in which you can exchange real-world money for nether gold, and you can buy special game packages from the Steam store that include this special currency. The gold does not go toward weapons, however, only cosmetic items; it's included for those who are too impatient to save up money to cosplay as Deadpool or the Master Chief."", 'Nether plays host to a number of glitches and irritating hang-ups. The game\'s engine isn\'t well optimized, and even if your computer is used to high-tier games, it will still struggle to render Nether\'s world. You can\'t swim, at least not in any traditional sense. Trying to tread water found in the western fields can get you hopelessly stuck, and drowning is an agonizingly slow process. If you need to bypass channels, you must hit the water while jumping to mimic the act of swimming. If you emerge alive, the water blurs your vision with a blue filter that lasts for around five seconds. Worse than that are sticking keys, which once caused me to accidentally walk out of a hole on the side of a multistory sky scraper. If you\'re up to the task, you can seek out Nether\'s infamous dune buggy, which has, uh, a few kinks that need to be ironed out. One you find it, the warning ""USE AT YOUR OWN RISK"" pops up onscreen. Some players have dubbed it the ""buggy buggy,"" because driving it is a glitch-infused nightmare.', 'Regardless of everything that drags the game down, Nether provides some compelling moments and creates stories to share. Some of my favorite tales are composed of times I felt the desire to leave the streets and travel to my destination using the often underused subway system. The silence in the tunnels was therapeutic after the tension on the surface, for a time. In the subway, flickering lights supplement the lonely sound of your footsteps, which is abruptly broken by noise from the surface. Just above your head comes the sound of screeching demons, followed by the sharp crack of gunfire and then silence. The reality of the situation is enough to snap you back into focus, as it must, because soon the tunnel ends, and you once again have to face the light.', 'Such moments are fleeting, however, and dissipate just as you get accustomed to their sudden, yet welcome, company. Nether is noticeably unfinished, and has a lot of work ahead before it resembles a solid game. But it has a discernible spark of life. There is potential for it to become a game worthy of attention. The environment it presents is huge, and the grayed-out portions of the map serve to tease you with even more areas to explore, and stories to create, in its bleak, abysmal, yet interesting world. If only it can learn to stop tripping over its own feet.']"Nathan Meunier,23-Jun-14,Anomaly Defenders Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/anomaly-defenders-review/1900-6415793/,5,PC,"[""With so many tower defense games flooding the market, the fact that the first two Anomaly games aimed for something wildly different made them far more exciting to dig into. In both of those games you played the role of the attackers, controlling a free-roaming human commander who laid power-ups and issued commands for your rolling armored convoy to obey as it snaked its way through the alien-infested battlefield. It offered brilliant little twists to spice up a genre that has grown stale. For all its sci-fi splendor and pulse-pounding challenge, Anomaly Defenders marks a big step backward from the innovation that made its predecessors so memorable. That's not quite enough to ruin the experience altogether, but it does wind down the series on a weak note."", ""Defenders takes the ongoing conflict to the alien homeworld, where the human forces are launching a massive counterattack. That means your role in battle is flip-flopped, however, placing you in the metallic skin of the aliens as you make a frantic attempt to hold back the human assault so your escape pods can launch to safety. The story-driven character interactions and surprises that drove the narrative between missions in the previous games have been stripped out, leaving a 24-mission campaign that plays more like a series of stand-alone war puzzles than the cohesive plot-centric encounters we've seen before. Changing things up yet again might have been a welcome move, if the shift didn't push the series into predictable territory."", ""As it turns out, being on the defensive in this new chapter of the human-alien war is a lot less interesting once you've had a taste of the series' alternative approach to the genre. Plunking down a variety of upgradable alien towers and turrets, you must defend your base's launchpad from the waves of well-armed human convoys that roll in to wreak havoc. Defensive towers can be plugged into pre-laid nodes littered around each map, and you often have to juggle attacks from different directions. Meanwhile, you rely on resource harvesters to amass funds to bolster your forces and to lure enemies to specific areas of the map."", ""I'll admit that there's a certain thrill that comes from going hands-on with the sweet alien tech that obliterated your human forces in the previous games. Watching the devastating power of the behemoth in action is a treat, and the laser-spewing scorchers are equally satisfying additions to your arsenal. Unfortunately, much of this excitement fades as it becomes clear that Defenders' gameplay largely embraces many of the classic tower defense genre traditions that the series first sought to push away from. Despite the return to the status quo, it does put a few neat ideas into play that keep this final encounter from being a total disappointment."", ""The puzzle-like stage designs feature lots of branching pathways for enemy convoys to use, and they're often drawn toward your harvesters. This makes the strategic deployment of both your defensive towers and your resource-gathering bunkers a huge component of Defenders' gameplay. It's not just about dropping towers willy-nilly and upgrading them until they shred the oncoming parade of tanks, robots, and fighters."", ""Rerouting enemy forces into your thickest defense groupings whenever possible is as important as varying your strategy to account for dynamic shifts on the battlefield. You have finite resources and lots of fluctuating variables to consider at any given moment in battle. Some stages drop meteors on your head or unleash lighting strikes that temporarily jam your towers. Other areas send foes marching from multiple directions at the same time or involve bombing runs that don't follow the map's network of roadways. Which units you use, how and when you upgrade them, and where you place them can make a huge difference in whether you win a match or get crushed."", ""Tower abilities also play a critical role in every match. Defenders sports a robust tech tree with unlockable units and abilities you can put in play, and the latter in particular add another welcome layer of depth to battlefield strategizing. Defeated foes drop energy points that can be amassed and spent at any moment to trigger any of your towers to use specific support abilities you've unlocked on the tech tree. Simple things like shielding and repairs help prolong your units' life spans when under fire, but other cool effects, such as EMP blasts that disable enemy shields, sniper shots that boost your firing range, and self-destruct sequences, round out your tactical options."", ""Some of the game's more important nuances, like the distinct advantages of using specific towers against certain enemy types, easily get lost in the chaos. There's often so much going on at any given moment that absorbing the bombardment of info about which enemies are approaching and how to best thwart their attacks with the limited resources you can lay down is a dizzying task. The ability to pause the battle to zoom in and queue up tower placement and upgrades is certainly helpful, but it doesn't fully stave off the overwhelming deluge that strikes in the heat of battle."", ""Even with its few unique facets and puzzle-like focus, Defenders' bursts of stress-tinged fun stretch only so far. Remove the offensive hook of playing as the human commander in the two previous Anomaly games, and you're left with a serviceable tower defense game that doesn't shine as brightly as it predecessors. Earlier Anomaly games proved that a little innovation can go a long way, but you just don't see as much of that approach in action here, which results in an underwhelming and familiar return to the norm.""]"Daniel Starkey,21-Jun-14,Hegemony Rome: The Rise of Caesar Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hegemony-rome-the-rise-of-caesar-review/1900-6415795/,5,PC,"[""Hegemony Gold: Wars of Ancient Greece was easily one of my favorite real-time strategy games. It was rough, but it captivated me with some of the freshest ideas I'd seen in a while. Hegemony Rome drops almost all of the cleverness of its predecessor and replaces it with a lackluster facsimile poorly concealing an almost hollow frame."", ""Hegemony Rome: The Rise of Caesar follows one of history's most prolific conquerors through his Gallic campaign and the political aftermath. The game's story mode captures only a few of the really big historical moments, but it helps serve as a primer for the sandbox mode, which gives you all of Gaul and Southern Britain to play with. From there, you build up cities, gather resources, and expand--all typical of an average RTS game."", ""What makes the Hegemony series different from most is its attention to historical accuracy. It plays as somewhat of a cross between Europa Universalis and the Total War series. You spend a lot of time managing the minute details of your cities and forts, but you can also seamlessly zoom back out to a wide-area view that shows where all of the key points of interest are. In that sense, it's a lot smoother than Total War, which basically plays out as two games, one strategic and one tactical. In Hegemony Rome, you have one big map with two ways of looking at it. Unfortunately, while that system is great for quickly navigating from one battle to another across the map, it can be a bit unwieldy. As you pull the camera back, the texture of the large-scale paper map begins to replace the trees, mountains, and fields a bit too quickly, cutting off indicators for troop morale and circumstantial bonuses (such as flanking and charging). Because neither view offers up all of the information you need at any given point, a system that should be a boon often comes off as an annoyance."", ""The big draws of Hegemony Gold were troop management and logistics, and in these areas, it can be defined as a counterexample to other games of its type. In Starcraft, you didn't really need to manage supplies for your troops. You had a big pool, and every unit you built took from that pool. No additional management was required. Hegemony Gold was quite different. Not only did you have global resource totals that represented the theoretical maximum of your empire, but you also had to move those resources from city to city. If you were building up a big force to capture a new city, wherever you stationed your soldiers needed to have enough resources to keep them fed and happy, or you'd see them dissolve within a few minutes. That mechanic was reinforced by an entire system of troop formations, stances, and tactics that not only raised the stakes of proper administration but also felt cohesive and sturdy."", ""Hegemony Rome keeps a few of those concepts, but also waters them down to the point of near irrelevance. The emphasis here is on the supply lines themselves and making sure you have an efficient network of resource nodes to transport food, wood, and gold. Large forces still drain local resources pretty quickly, but that's rarely a problem. Hegemony Gold, however, limited the total number of resources that could move through any given area, unless upgraded. Each upgrade cost a lot to construct and maintain and forced you to make careful decisions about the best way to move resources around. Each city and resource node could also support only two or three supply lines, making your decisions that much more significant."", ""Hegemony Rome has almost none of these subtleties. All of your supplies can support an enormous resource flow, and only the foolishly long routes incur high penalties. They cost a fixed amount to maintain and cannot be upgraded, and you can make as many of them as you'd like. Their role is to support a fairly simple system of city and fort upgrades, but the mechanics behind this upgrade system are no longer robust enough to be compelling or interesting. Instead, the system encourages you to build up complex webs of short, cheap supply lines that minimize global losses. That makes the game extremely tedious, however, because forts, bridges, and cities need to be linked and bunched really close together. Tactics and big strategy take a backseat to tedium and rote patterns."", ""Every city is captured in more or less the same way. With a scout or two, you can get an eye for how strong the defenses are, and if the defense rating is below a certain number, you can be reasonably sure that you can capture the city in one go. If it's above a certain number, you simply have to starve the citizens out by blocking their supply lines and waiting. Once that's done, you get the new acquisition connected to your trade network, get a few upgrades in, leave a garrison, recruit a few new units, and keep the push going. Occasionally, you encounter a unique situation where the city is nestled in a cliff and you can use only a few units to attack versus your standard five or so. Outside of that, though, there's very little to mix up the combat."", ""Part of the problem is that there are no longer troop formation options. Instead of forming a chevron pattern or having your units stand in a circle with spears facing outward for defense, you typically choose one of two stances. Now, these offer similar bonuses to battle formations, but with only two options, there isn't enough variance to do much of anything. In the first Hegemony, I could have troops stationed in the wilderness and have them constantly gathering a little bit of food. If enemies approached, they assumed a defensive battle formation and stood their ground. If the opposing force was too much, playing defensively would at least buy me enough time to move cavalry in a wedge formation to break enemy ranks and cause them to scatter. When I would siege enemy cities, I would often find that they had kept some extra units nearby to ambush and flank attackers. These were complex, emergent battle tactics that were facilitated by the game's mechanics. That kind of complexity doesn't happen anymore. Too much has been cut out, and not enough added back in to compensate. The only thing that is more robust in Hegemony Rome is the expansion of unit upgrades. As your soldiers fight and earn experience, they can gain skills that improve their maximum morale, or they can add more soldiers to their ranks. These upgrades are nice, but they're not enough to help fill out such a large game."", ""At this point, I've put more than 24 hours into Hegemony Rome, but I feel like it's waging some kind of psychological warfare on me. Outside of the first couple of hours, I've gone through the exact same process: expand, fortify, hold, lather, rinse, repeat. It's remarkably addictive, but in a cheap, Skinner box way. There's nothing to improve upon, so I'm not compelled to try harder. I just keep capturing things."", ""I went back a few times recently to play the first Hegemony to see if I just had huge nostalgia glasses for the series. I didn't. Hegemony Gold really is that much better. Everything from the user interface to the unit AI was and still is superior. To be fair, not every game needs to live up to its predecessor, but Rise of Caesar can't even stand on its own. Almost everything here is mediocre, and that's really a shame given the promise of Wars of Ancient Greece.""]"Britton Peele,20-Jun-14,Munin Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/munin-review/1900-6415796/,6,PC,"['In Norse mythology, Hugin and Munin were two ravens who served the god Odin as informants, flying over Midgard and reporting what they found. While Munin the game takes inspiration from that story, this tile-turning puzzle platformer uses its Nordic setting as window dressing more than anything else. The result is an OK puzzle game with some nice art and some neat twists on proven puzzle types, but it also feels like it squanders some potential with its theme.', 'The titular Munin has been stripped of her wings by Loki, forcing her to get around on two legs as she hunts down her precious feathers. As Munin, you can walk and jump around the environment, but without your wings, you are severely limited in where you can go. Each puzzle is separated into multiple tiles, with feathers scattered throughout that you must collect. To get around the level, you need to rotate tiles by clicking on them, creating paths and matching up parts of the environment to get to your destination.', ""Clicking on a tile might rotate just that one segment of the level, or it might turn multiple tiles at once, but the biggest catch is that you cannot rotate a tile (or a set of connected tiles) if you're standing on it. It can sometimes be hard to tell which tiles will be affected with each click of the mouse (tiles are only barely highlighted when hovered over with the cursor), but for the most part, manipulating the environment in this way is smooth and effective. Each tile is well designed so that it can match up well with neighboring tiles, and it is unlikely that you will ever find yourself in a position where you trap yourself with no way out (save a few glitchy moments that unfortunately marred my own experience with the game)."", ""On its own, this formula would get stale fast, so thankfully Munin mixes things up regularly. The game's levels are separated into nine chapters, and each chapter focuses on a specific twist that you have to deal with (with the exception of the final chapter, which mixes them all together). One chapter, for example, involves water. The trick here is to turn the tiles in such a way as to make water flow to areas where you can swim through it to the feathers you need to collect. A later chapter has you using lasers to open paths and doorways, while another involves sliding gems into slots to activate platforms."", ""The variety in these different puzzle elements is welcome, but unfortunately, some are much more entertaining than others. Particularly disappointing are puzzle types in which you can be killed in an instant, forcing you to restart the level. The chapter focusing on lava is the worst offender in this regard, since the slightest touch from the substance kills you instantaneously. Because the lava spreads fast and its physics can be unpredictable, it feels like it's rushing you to move quickly, which in turn leads to more deadly mistakes. You might find yourself nearly finished with a puzzle, after spending a good 10 minutes or more solving it, only to turn the wrong tile for just a split second. Before you can react, you're dead, and you have to start over."", ""There's nothing inherently wrong with having an element of danger in a puzzle game, but the way it's implemented here is more frustrating than challenging. The game punishes trial and error, making tiny mistakes incredibly costly. Furthermore, while the game's movement controls are fine when you're moving slowly, they're neither quick nor precise enough to be satisfying when a puzzle requires strict timing or jumping ability."", ""For as frustrating as this makes some of the puzzles, however, there is a lot to like when Munin gets things right. Many slower-paced, more methodical puzzles are enjoyable to work through, and they're just difficult enough to be satisfying when solved. The game is at its best when it not only lets you take your time, but allows you to experiment without fear of losing progress. For these reasons, the chapters that involved matching sets of runes and redirecting beams of light ended up being the most enjoyable for me, though if there had been many more of them, the hook would have grown tiresome."", ""A lot of love for mythic poetry and prose is present in Munin's text, which is complemented by music and art that do a good job of evoking a sense of a Nordic world. Still, the gameplay is so far removed from the legends, and the story is so bare-bones, that the setting rarely feels meaningful. Thanks in large part to its more frustrating puzzles, Munin ends up feeling too long. It has its moments of brilliance, but ultimately it doesn't have the legs (or wings) to let it reach the heights of similar games in the genre.""]"Britton Peele,18-Jun-14,Dead Rising 3 Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/super-ultra-dead-rising-3-arcade-remix-hyper-editi/1900-6415791/,7,Xbox One,"[""Dead Rising 3 struggled with the balance of its tone. It portrayed a grittier, serious world while still trying to appeal to the fans who enjoyed the series' more offbeat humor. Super Ultra Dead Rising 3 Arcade Remix Hyper Edition EX Plus Alpha swings as far in the opposite direction as possible, going completely over the top while also paying more homage to Capcom's arcade history than all three Dead Rising games combined."", 'Unlike previous downloadable content for the game, Super Arcade Dead Rising 3 takes the bare-bones controls and format of Dead Rising 3 and does something very different with them. The world is not open, your weapons cannot be combined, and there is no real progression of characters or story. Instead, you are given a time limit to you fight your way through a series of arcade-like challenges, ranging from ""Kill 50 zombies"" to ""Retrieve the vehicles"" to Escape the city."" While you can accomplish this alone, the challenges are best played with a group of up to four online friends, all working together while at the same time fighting for a higher score.', 'This isn\'t because the co-op is innovative or expertly designed. Honestly, you do the exact same things with one person as you do with four. However, tasks that might become monotonous alone are accomplished far more quickly with help, which makes for a brisk, exciting pace through the game\'s challenges. For example, one of the tasks you come across more than once is ""Rescue the survivors."" The survivors in question--8-bit-style citizens crying out for help--are merely pickups that you need to touch to ""rescue,"" but running around the environment to find them all can take a long time when you\'re on your own. With friends, you can each explore different sections of the map and be done with the matter.', ""The way it moves you briskly from one challenge to the next is one of Super Arcade Dead Rising 3's strengths, as each individual task doesn't stand tall on its own. While the basic act of killing zombies (whether with weapons or in vehicles) in Dead Rising 3 is as fun as it ever was, the game is great about giving you different goals to accomplish, usually in rapid-fire succession. You may be asked to kill 100 zombies, yes, but then you are immediately sent to destroy specific items around town before you need to escape the area altogether--all as a timer ticks down, encouraging you to hurry. With skill, you can finish a list of tasks within a few minutes before moving onto the next round of challenges."", ""You do this across four districts, each based on a different section of Dead Rising 3's map. Fundamentally, these are the same environments from the base game, but they've been brightened up with lots of color, neon arcade signs, and a generally cheerier atmosphere than the drab color scheme you're probably more familiar with. So while the city's major landmarks won't be new to you, the coat of paint makes them at least a bit fresh."", 'Super Dead Rising 3 Arcade Remix\'s main draw isn\'t the slaughter of the undead; it\'s the zaniness surrounding it. The second you jump into the DLC, accessible from Dead Rising 3\'s main menu, its arcade influence is front and center. You\'re greeted with an old-school memory check screen, a joke about those old ""Winners Don\'t Use Drugs"" PSAs (fitting in with Dead Rising 3\'s canon, this one reads ""Winners Get Chipped""), and then Capcom\'s classic logo jingle, right before a remix of the old Street Fighter II menu music starts up.', 'It\'s clear that Capcom aims to tug at the nostalgic heartstrings of its old fans, and frankly, it works. At just about every point possible, the developer shoves something in your face and says, ""Hey, remember this old game we made? What about this one?"" These references are old enough that they don\'t feel like advertising (there are no references to the likes of Dragon\'s Dogma or Monster Hunter) and instead evoke the feeling you might get when flipping through an old video game magazine and looking back at the biggest hits of the 90s. Whether it\'s Frank West dressed up as Mike Haggar or a billboard for Mega Man X4, you see signs of Capcom\'s history everywhere.', 'But it doesn\'t feel like outright exploitation of old brands. In fact, it feels like a celebration of them, as if at least a few people at Capcom woke up one morning and said, ""We haven\'t paid as much homage to our classics as we perhaps should have."" So when you see references to Rival Schools or Power Stone, or when you turn into Tofu (a particularly obscure Resident Evil 2 reference), it all seems to come from a place of genuine appreciation.', ""This is also true of the character selection. Each of the 20 options on the character select screen are different variations of established Dead Rising characters Nick, Annie, Chuck, and Frank, but more than half of the options are nods to other characters from Capcom's past. And these aren't mere costume changes. Each character feels unique, with its own attributes and attacks. Each character also has a unique special attack that is directly influenced by the character's source material. So when you play as Annie dressed as Regina from Dino Crisis, it feels more like you're playing as Regina herself, especially when her special move involves a pterodactyl that swoops in to attack the enemies in front of her."", ""The result of all of this is an homage to classic Capcom. When developers cash in on its audience's nostalgia, they often do so through half-measures such as classic costumes and other trinkets that have little to no bearing on actual gameplay. Instead of taking that route, the developers of Super Dead Rising 3 Arcade Remix have created something unique and heartfelt, and ultimately much more entertaining."", ""The entertainment has its limits, though. Nostalgia can take you only so far, after all. The game is obviously intended for co-op players and is most enjoyable when played with friends or even strangers, and you can blaze through the game's four districts in no time at all, whether you're playing alone or not. The replay value comes in unlocking all of the game's 20 characters, which requires replaying levels many times over with different characters, as well as hunting down arcade cabinets hidden throughout each district. If you don't have allies to do this with, you might find the experience a slog, and whether it was due to technological inferiority or the DLC's unpopularity, I often had difficulty finding strangers to play with."", ""If you don't have much love for Capcom's back catalog, or you don't already enjoy Dead Rising 3, there's not much for you here other than a possible chuckle or two. You need to understand and revel in a bonus level that involves nothing more than destroying a car in order to fully grasp why this DLC is special. But if the idea of fighting a giant zombified M. Bison as Nick Ramos dressed as Felicia from Darkstalkers is exciting to you, then Super Dead Rising 3 Arcade Remix is a blast.""]"Miguel Concepcion,17-Jun-14,Enemy Front Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/enemy-front-review/1900-6415792/,5,Xbox 360 & PS3,"[""Enemy Front's loading screens depict fictionalized, up-close, and chaotic moments from various battles of World War II. As the camera slowly flies around these scenes frozen in time, you soak in the mayhem: a swarm of Nazis in aggressive poses, gunfire and muzzle flashes filling the screen, and emotional civilians running for cover. You're given the impression that Enemy Front's gameplay will let you experience these dynamic moments. Yet this is a glamorized, false impression, which is all the more unfortunate given that it has been a while since we've had a notable WWII first-person shooter (not counting Wolfenstein: The New Order). It's a bad sign when loading screens are the most eye-catching parts of a game."", ""At first, it's easy to go along with the premise of playing an American-journalist-turned-freedom-fighter named Robert Hawkins. He's a one-man army for only a handful of missions; the rest of the time, he's either partnered with an operative or part of a large squad. And while Enemy Front follows the location-hopping flow common in many shooters, Hawkins' European tour is a believable one because it doesn't shoehorn missions in Italy, North Africa, or anywhere east of Poland. One notable setting is a colorful, sun-drenched French countryside that echoes the opening scene from Inglourious Basterds."", ' ', ""Given that he's a reporter, it's puzzling and laughable that the delivery of Hawkins' radio-broadcasted motivational speeches during the Warsaw Uprising is painfully flat. This poor presentation is a missed opportunity that's meant to complement the story's nonlinear structure, which, by the way, could have benefited from further exposition and context for those unfamiliar with the uprising. Moreover, Hawkins' character development feels forced; he starts as an opportunistic, news-hungry reporter on the front lines and slowly realizes there are greater goals in this war than the next big scoop. When you have something as clear-cut as a tyrannical occupation, it's hard to believe Hawkins couldn't empathize with the resistance movement right from the start."", 'This is a first-person shooter set in Europe during World War II, so you get to kill lots and lots of Nazis. The anticipation of killing more Nazis in subsequent chapters is one of the very few factors motivating you to keep playing Enemy Front. The most satisfying kills involve the familiar FPS tactics: killing two foes with a single bullet, banking a grenade off a wall, and pulling off multiple kills with an explosive barrel. Developer City Interactive also assumes you have some interest in playing as a sniper, since Enemy Front uses the exact same aiming system as the developer\'s Sniper: Ghost Warrior series, so much so that this game could have easily been rebranded as a Ghost Warrior spin-off. Despite the game\'s ""play as you like"" marketing, using the sniper is almost always the best approach.', ""It takes little time to be convinced that City Interactive wanted to branch out beyond the orderly objectives and methodical linearity that define Sniper: Ghost Warrior. Enemy Front's early chapters provide scant glimpses of the more ambitious ideas the studio was going for. The ability to pick a mission of your choosing made me recall the hub design of the 2009 version of Wolfenstein. A few chapters later, you have the option to send a truck downhill toward an unsuspecting squad of Nazis. These unconventional sections are Enemy Front's most intriguing features, of which there are very few."", ""The wide-linear design of Enemy Front might feel inspired by Crysis 2 and Dishonored, yet its levels do not encourage the same degree of stimulating improvisation due to the lack of unpredictable enemy behavior. What made dying fun in Crysis 2 was that you got to try a different strategy with each retry, resulting in new enemy reactions each time. You are nearly deprived of that feeling in Enemy Front. Because of the game's poorly laid checkpoints, dying elicits a sense of frustration and boredom at the prospect of having to retread over half a mile's worth of leveled French villages. The thought of having to kill the same 20-plus Nazis a second or third time was so unappealing that I felt no guilt running past them after subsequent respawns. This says a lot since these aren't the smartest Nazis. Sure, they're consistently keen enough to spot you if you're out in the open too long, but once they're on alert, their movements are disappointingly predictable. If you don't want to leave any survivors, you can use the classic shooter exploit of funneling enemies toward you for easy pickings."", ""As much as Enemy Front also wants to cater to the stealth enthusiast, sneaking in this game is typically a cumbersome ordeal. A stealth kill is often useless since the drawn-out brutality of stabbing a downed Nazi three times is five seconds too long and leaves you open to detection. It's not as the studio intended, but you're better off approaching guards from the side since melee kills are instant and you get to avoid the stealth kill prompt. The contrast between the two methods is baffling."", ""The inclination to run past entire squads of Nazis is partially related to the game's lack of play-style incentives. Yes, many great shooters don't have progression rewards, but it doesn't feel like City Interactive tried to give you reasons to play one way over another. Even the Nazi Eagle collectibles scattered throughout Europe don't offer any tangible payoff, let alone any of the expository factoids that you usually get from these kinds of items."", 'Enemy Front could still have been an appealing and straightforward Nazi whack-a-mole game if not for its hot mess of glitches and poor design choices. It greatly suffers from frequent split-second freezes, often during crucial moments, such as when you switch to your scope or perform a melee kill. When allies accidentally complete objectives for you (for example, killing key generals), these accomplishments do not count toward your progress. This locks you from advancing, forcing you to reload the last checkpoint.', ""Since the multiplayer lacks the background bedlam of planes flying by or mortar shells hitting every couple of seconds, it's unsurprising that it plays more fluidly than the campaign. While the modest selection of maps are sufficiently large and multileveled, the uninspired deathmatch and conquest modes offer nothing that you can't find in other shooters. It also doesn't help that weapons always respawn in the exact same locations. The fun is gone once everyone knows to make a break for the rocket-launching panzerschreck."", 'Enemy Front lands in that unfortunate middle area where its faults aren\'t bad enough to leave a painfully lasting negative impression, but its key moments are too generic to be memorable. At a party 10 years from now, I\'ll suddenly recall the V2 rocket sabotage mission or the Warsaw siege chapter, yet I will have forgotten what game these scenes were from. It will drive me mad for the rest of the night, since it\'s unlikely anyone will pop up and say, ""You\'re thinking about Enemy Front."" And even if someone did chime in with the correct answer, I might not be convinced it was that game. That\'s the impression Enemy Front makes.']"Nick Capozzoli,16-Jun-14,Always Sometimes Monsters Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/always-sometimes-monsters-review/1900-6415789/,5,PC,"['Call it Chekhov\'s platitude. You see a conspicuous title like ""Always Sometimes Monsters,"" and you can bet that in the third act some character is going to fire off that string of words verbatim as part of some truism on the human condition. We\'re always sometimes monsters, you see. Or something.', 'I can hear echoes of Don Cheadle\'s faux-wistful speech from Crash: ""In LA, nobody touches you. ... I think we miss that touch so much that we crash into each other, just so we can feel something."" In A.O. Scott\'s Times review of the film, he\'d wondered about a possible name for the genre Crash typified: stories ""where people from radically different backgrounds are brought together by a grim serendipity that forces them, or at least the audience, to acknowledge their essential connectedness."" I find myself wishing Scott had settled on a term for the genre, because Vagabond Dog\'s Always Sometimes Monsters is it, whatever ""it"" is.', ""Always Sometimes Monsters is full of strange people who wax philosophic to those they've just met. People who commit felonies to avoid minor inconveniences, and who constantly vacillate between righteous empathy and callous disregard for their fellow man. One of those people is you, a failed writer and failed lover who has received an unexpected wedding invitation from your ex. The particulars of that relationship are flexible, dictated from player to game by a simple choice of drinks at a party. It's an elegant character select system in disguise, wherein personal qualities like gender, race, and sexual preference are never made to suffer the crass fumbling of sliders and toggles. Always Sometimes Monsters has been lauded for this--and rightly so--but it botches the landing: while the selection of male characters runs the full gamut of body types, the available women range from the impossibly cute to the improbably endowed. The latter cup their breasts between their biceps suggestively, or rest them over a bit of forearm scaffolding."", ""Ah. So it's a video game we're playing then, lest we'd somehow forgotten--an RPG Maker game, to be specific, boxed into the do-it-yourself engine's low resolution frame and sporting only the most rudimentary audiovisuals. But it's enough to shuffle Always Sometimes Monsters along toward its main thrust--an exploration of choice and consequence. As you set about the task of finding a way to the wedding, the narrative dovetails immediately: You're short on your rent. Do you resort to crime to make up the difference, or sleep on a soiled mattress in the adjoining alley? A few menial job prospects have revealed themselves, but do you keep a promise to do chores for your elderly neighbor instead?"", 'This sort of choice is, for some, the thing role-playing games ""do."" Linearity, to such a person, is a term of bitter disparagement. But branching narrative isn\'t always the sexy design it\'s so frequently made out to be. Before you can approximate your avatar\'s mindset, before you can make informed, satisfying decisions about relationships and careers, the fiction\'s table must be set--salad fork on the outside and all. But Always Sometimes Monsters\' in medias res story writes a check that the game\'s amateurish writing can\'t cash. We\'re asked to summon up emotional investment for new characters based on a scant few lines of blunt exposition, a la ""Sam is my best friend."" Then we\'re asked to sustain that investment as they\'re dropped from the narrative altogether for most of the proceedings.', 'The issue is exacerbated by the limitations of the engine powering Always Sometimes Monsters. Without voice, or gesture, or change of expression, characters met can only be evaluated by their portraiture and a bit of anime emotional shorthand--heart icons for love, sweat drops for exasperation. Disappointingly, the personalities found therein rarely deviate much from the often stereotypical appearances.', ""Take your good friend, Darkeff. You know he's your good friend because your character states that he's your good friend. Darkeff is a musician. He's also a recovering heroin addict. When he stumbles upon a bag of the stuff, I gamely look for options to get it out of his hands, but my curiously incurious character doesn't seem to see much cause for concern. Fast-forward a few days, and guess who's in the hospital, dying for want of healthcare funds. Our good friend Darkeff wears the same sunglasses he always wears even in near-death, and his guitar sits in the corner of his room, perhaps because we might not know who he is otherwise."", ""You're short on your rent. Do you resort to crime to make up the difference, or sleep on a soiled mattress in the adjoining alley?"", ""Still more issues rise up from the depths to challenge immersion. Always Sometimes Monsters doesn't like to abandon any one narrative thread until it has achieved peak melodrama. So at the behest of another addict, you're inexorably compelled to blackmail the doctor, either by snooping through his files or, as I elected, by smashing up his expensive car. But as luck would have it, another character who'd just earlier promised me a ride out of town was planning, unbeknownst to me, to borrow that very same car. Grim serendipity, indeed."", ""With choice and consequence thusly meted out, the results of each of Always Sometimes Monsters' vignettes are entered into your character's diary. But considering the inherent absurdity of most of the scenarios and the disconnect between player and character, there's no question about who is authoring those journal entries. When a character recites your ignominious history back to you near the game's end and asks you to reflect on each entry--this actually happens--it reads like a case of mistaken identity."", 'Pleasantly, Always Sometimes Monsters doesn\'t hand down much in the way of judgment. There\'s no morality stat here, and though most of the cast is given to fortune cookie musings (""Stay true to who you are, whoever you think that is"" says one in parting, apropos of nothing), they\'re mercifully laissez-faire. While this does result in some juvenile apathy, particularly during a mayoral election mid-game, Always Sometimes Monsters\' moral reticence is its strongest quality. The subtle but persistent gravitational pull of poverty in the game means a lot of time spent performing excruciating temp work, or hanging out in alleyways and bars, but most of Always Sometimes Monsters\' interesting characters occupy those very same haunts.', ""The camera's viewpoint, an otherwise awkward mash-up of overhead and axonometric shots, reveals all the pixelated squalor, all the detritus and homelessness and violence that so often goes ignored by the upper crust. The RPG feels at home here, among the dregs of society, like it did back in the Midgar slums of Final Fantasy VII. The genre's old mainstays--fetching, bartering, and grinding--are much more suited to a blue collar than they are to plate armor."", ' ']"Kevin VanOrd,16-Jun-14,Entwined Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/entwined-review/1900-6415790/,7,PS4,"['Two creatures--one a fish, the other a bird--come together and then are pulled apart, their love undeniable, and the rules of nature difficult to overcome. Entwined tries to tell their story, but it is not very adept at communicating a sense of romance, though it is nonetheless calming on its own terms. The journey is short and comforting, a simple coalition of ambient beauty and pattern recognition. Yet for all its gentle delights, Entwined is also too ephemeral for its own good, its sweet whispers tempting you onwards, and then dissipating into the wind once the experience has ended.', ' ', 'On the right side of the screen, blue rectangles and triangles come together in the shape of a soaring bird; on the left, an equally angular fish swims along. The two flit through a tunnel swirling with abstract visualizations and glowing orbs. Each creature is only allowed to move within its own hemisphere, the right side representing the air, the left representing the sea. The two may come together at the top or bottom of the screen, where they each turn green and emanate a soft chime, as if their adoration for each other is so great that they cannot help but glow with excitement. As the bird and fish automatically travel through the vortex, blue and orange windows appear, and you are to navigate through them, seeking to reach a state of unity in which the two beings merge into a single wondrous creature. The bird is controlled with the right stick, and the fish with the left.', ' ', ' ', ""Entwined is awash with sound and color, and its primary goal is to lure you into a trance with its pulsating music and symmetrical patterns. The game is separated into nine stages, called lifetimes, each of which radiates its own kind of comforting energy. In the fourth lifetime, for instance, you travel through a rust-red cavern in which a steady synthesized melody keeps the tempo, and heaving guitars cry out responses to it. As the bird and fish float through their checkpoints, a drum beat sounds out, and the two creatures become part of the level's rhythm section. The placement of the windows creates a rhythm of its own, causing your thumbs to flick with urgency, in contrast to other levels, which require smoother thumb movement. Each lifetime finds subtle ways to mesh the gameplays patterns with the musical accompaniment, though the gameplay itself doesnt greatly vary during the hour or so it takes to complete the story mode."", 'Ultimately, Entwined doesnt boast much diversity. The cylindrical structure of each stage may recall 2012s Dyad, but where Dyad made each stage a new opportunity to do something new, Entwined is relaxed and comforting, and at least in its story mode, rarely provides much challenge or variety. Left- and right-stick movements are typically parallel in the most obvious manners, and when they are not, one creature usually needs to simply stay in place while the other navigates through its checkpoints. Halfway through the game, I longed for a new idea, an unexpected pattern, or a more poignant thematic representation of the two characters unfulfilled love. It wasnt until the last minutes of the final level when the lifetimes coalesced in any meaningful way, but the pretty visuals gave way to a tedious object hunt that sucked the joy from the screen.', 'Entwined is awash with sound and color, and its primary goal is to lure you into a trance with its pulsating music and symmetrical patterns.', 'That hunt occurs in the same kind of denouement that ends each level. The two animals, finally united (in death, it would seem), bond and transmogrify into a fantastical fishbird that you control freely. These sequences only require that you collect enough floating orbs to fill a meter at the top of the screen, at which point you then etch a pattern into the air, with vibrant color trails emanating from your wings and forming rainbow-colored ribbons that remind me of musical staves. There is no greater objective here than to collect and to skywrite: this is your reward for uniting two halves into their romantic whole. The imagery is always beautiful, though just as with the primary gameplay, I longed for skywriting to have more meaning than just pretty. The post-union flights bring with them some catharsis, but its fleeting. The ebbs and flows dont create waves of emotions so much as minor ripples.', 'Challenge levels provide more intellectual stimulation than the story, giving you three lives and removing one for each colored window you miss. You must remain active for a certain number of seconds to unlock the next challenge--and you must remain active for even longer if you wish to have any hope of rising to the top of Entwineds leaderboards. Sadly, some of the fire challenges sound effects have a habit of going missing, a hitch almost as distracting as the pause that occurs in the transitions connecting each levels core gameplay and the soaring celebration that follows. But these moment dont define Entwined. This is a lovely, gossamer experience that lifts you into the clouds and then quietly brings you back to earth, happy for the time spent, and your mind free of the detritus that originally cluttered it.']"Britton Peele,16-Jun-14,1001 Spikes Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/1001-spikes-review/1900-6415787/,8,PS4 & PlayStation Vita,"[""Whether it's entirely true or not, classic games from the NES era are remembered as being far more difficult than the average game today. 1001 Spikes goes all out when attempting to re-create that sense of intense challenge, making a game that not only looks and sounds like one from the 8-bit era, but plays like it as well. But it's not for those who simply want nostalgia. You also need to have patience, perseverance, and a desire for the sweet taste of conquest that comes from every victory."", ""For the most part, 1001 Spikes plays with all the simplicity of an NES platformer. You can run, you can jump, and you can attack. To jump, however, you have two different buttons: a high jump and a low jump. Jumping low can give you a bit more distance and also gets you back on the ground faster, while jumping high lets you reach more areas and dodge more obstacles. Both types of jumps are essential in different areas, and mastering the ability to use the right jump at the right time is one of 1001 Spikes' earliest and most important challenges. If you get into the habit of using only one type of jump, you will fail."", ' ', ""The goal in 1001 Spikes is simple: collect a key and reach the exit, stopping to pick up a golden skull collectible if you can. While there are occasionally enemies in your way, your toughest opponent is always the environment itself. True to the game's title, spikes are everywhere and often pop out of floors, walls, and ceilings when you don't expect them to. Blocks fall out from under you, arrow traps trigger and kill you, and platforms move and confuse you. The level is your enemy, and it laughs in your face."", 'But while the stages are antagonistic, they are also fair. Every monster is on a pattern, every trap obeys strict rules, and every movement is precise. When you die, the claim ""luck wasn\'t on my side"" is never enough, because there is no element of random chance at play here. You may have gone one pixel too far and died, but that was your fault, not the game\'s.', ""This is not to say there is no element of trial and error. It's often the case that you won't know how to finish a stage until you die several (dozen?) times. There may be a block that crumbles the second you stand on it, with no visual cues to warn you that would be the case. Even if you have split-second reaction times, you will probably have to poke and prod at a level before you unlock its secrets. Not only do you need perfect timing and quick reflexes, but you also need the will to fight on until you understand what the level requires."", ""Of course, dying isn't always fun. Sometimes it's frustrating running through the same areas over and over again. Granted, each level is short (many if not most can be finished in under a minute if you're skilled enough), but beating your head against a wall can grow tiring. Fortunately, there is a level skip option if you simply want to move on, but it can get you only so far. Without completing every stage, you cannot finish the game or unlock the series of even more challenging stages that lie beyond the game's credits."", 'Blocks fall out from under you, arrow traps trigger and kill you, and platforms move and confuse you. The level is your enemy, and it laughs in your face.', ""And there's something to be said for perseverance, even when you want to throw your controller out of frustration.

But just as the door was opening and I was about to breathe a sigh of relief, a set of spikes came up from the floor and killed me. It would take another couple of dozen tries before I was able to make it to the end and figure out the trick to surviving long enough to successfully exit. It was frustrating, especially since I couldn't merely experiment with the part that was giving me trouble--I had to retry from the beginning."", ""But with each death, I learned. While at first I was unable to survive more than a couple of seconds on the level in question (and I do mean that literally), I soon found myself expertly navigating through early traps. Even the most daunting obstacles eventually became not only doable, but almost routine. I still died--a lot--but I was making noticeable improvements as I went. The experience was brutal, unforgiving, and frustrating, but it was only beating me because I wasn't good enough. And when I finally bested the level, the exhilaration I felt was something that's not often matched in games."", 'Though the main story mode will take you many hours to inch your way through, 1001 Spikes comes packed with alternative ways to play. There is a sizable collection of unlockable characters, most coming from other games (such as Bit.Trip Runner and Cave Story) and each with its own unique attributes and abilities. They also have their own stories, though some are far more involved than others.', ""These characters can also be used in a couple of side games that take the same mechanics and twist the gameplay slightly. The Tower of Nanner mode, for example, has you climbing a series of (mostly) vertically scrolling levels, but lets you continue from where you left off if you die (until you run out of lives). On consoles, these unlockable modes can be played cooperatively as well, which can be frantic and fun, but you're not missing out on too much if you opt for the single-player-only experience on portable systems."", ""One of the few areas in which 1001 Spikes is lacking is in comparing your performances with other players. The game puts an emphasis on your best times, and even has the option of using a speedrun clock if you so choose, yet there are no online leaderboards with which to compare scores with friends and strangers. That's too bad, because self-imposed misery loves company, and 1001 Spikes is best for the kind of person who can take punishment and enjoy it.

They range from a stone-tough businesswoman, to a shady mafioso looking to unload shady nuclear goods, to a rich playboy hoping to show some folks a good time, how else, but by strapping them to a ship that typically sails through asteroid belts and gunfire. The well-written script, fully voiced by an excellent cast, is generally funny, and the sharp sense of humor kept me smiling through every cutscene. The fantastic art direction coupled with nods to sci-fi influences ranging from Star Wars to Futurama is also a nice touch."", 'Your job as a space runner is to safely transport cargo from a starting location to a distant star port for delivery, a task easier said than done. At the onset of each mission, you place cargo modules of varying sizes on the hexagonal panels that make up your ship. The placement is tricky, because cargo can be as innocuous as some standard shipping crates, or as dangerous as temperamental nuclear armaments (that, yes, explode, causing some nasty damage) and alien crystals that drain power from surrounding panels. The necessary preparation is important because the last thing you want in the middle of an intense battle against swarming pirates is to be unable to place weapons due to de-energized panels or ones playing host to a pod of squealing tourists.', 'Getting your cargo safely to port takes speed and strategy. You view the field from an overhead angle that encompasses a large area of space around your ship. Radar warns you of incoming asteroids and enemy spacecraft, as well as their direct line of approach and chosen flight path. Also displayed is a countdown timer, which gives you precious few seconds to defend the ship by placing cannons, or shields if needed. Small asteroids and pirate drone ships are easily dispatched by a laser cannon or two, while larger craft may call for more powerful cannons or missile turrets. With a 360-degree field, enemies come at you from all angles, and as in most tower defense games, the difficulty ramps up as you progress.', 'Deciding when and where to place needed modules is mostly reactionary, because each fight forces you to rethink your strategy as you go along. There are moments when one ship you face is easily taken out with a barrage of missiles, but the next one is equipped with anti-missile defenses, rendering your tactics useless. Placed modules can be recycled and replaced in real time, and thinking quickly on your feet means the difference between creating safe passage for your cargo and watching it get burned to cinders.', ""You start out against small vessels that do little more than pester. But soon you find yourself plowing through asteroids large enough to tear your hull to shreds, because large pirate vessels strike from all sides using an assortment of powerful weaponry. The occasional boss fights against Space Run's pirate captains, who command enormous ships bristling with cannons, missiles, and shields, are harrowing, white-knuckled experiences from start to finish. Time is also a consideration, as you're always racing against the clock. To get to port faster, you must build engine thrusters, and the more you have, the quicker you reach your destination."", ""Reputation, displayed as stars, is earned at the end of each mission. How fast you get to port, as well as how much of your cargo is left intact, changes the number of stars gained as well as the size of your hard-won paycheck. You earn a currency called hexnuts by destroying enemies, asteroids, and the occasional neutral transport ship, and also reap hexnuts at the end of the level based on your performance. Hexnuts are exchanged in Space Run's in-game shop, where you can purchase offensive or defensive modules, or upgrade currently owned ones to be more powerful. The upgrading system is deep and varied, and the outcome of many battles changes drastically based solely on choosing the right upgrade or weapon related to the current mission at hand. Older levels can be replayed to earn a higher reputation and, in turn, more cash for upgrades. If you find yourself stuck on a mission, retreading a level or two can earn you the cash needed to even the odds."", ""Space Run shines from the depths of space, from the challenging gameplay to the deep strategy mechanics. I looked forward to every cutscene with glee, whether it featured Buck Mann talking terms with an employer, or had me trading fightin' words with pirates. There isn't much to gripe about, except that spoken words and the text in chat bubbles don't always match, and there is an occasional misspelled word, but that is just nitpicking. Overall, Space Run is an immensely enjoyable ride, starting with the initial docking bay, and lasting all the way to the final delivery.""]"Chris Watters,6-Jun-14,Borderlands 2 Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/borderlands-2-review/1900-6415786/,7,PlayStation Vita,"[""Borderlands 2 is a big game. The PlayStation Vita? Not so big. And yet the sprawling cooperative shooter has arrived intact on the portable platform, delivering long hours of shooting, looting, and butt jokes. Well, almost intact. Game design changes, like knocking the maximum player count down from four to two and changing the enemy death animations, do a good job of cutting corners while preserving the core action. Technical shortcomings, however, leave little doubt that this is the lesser version of Gearbox's great sequel. Dialogue and sound effects frequently sound flat and occasionally disappear, while the frame rate often slows down in combat and makes the chaotic action feel unwieldy."", ""Despite these limitations, Borderlands 2 on the Vita is still, very clearly, Borderlands 2. The world is colorful and diverse; the writing is witty and sometimes affecting; the loot is bountiful and rewarding; and the combat is entertaining and rowdy. Teaming up with another player and working your way through myriad quests on the path to increased skills, richer rewards, and Pandoran glory is great fun. It's just as easy to happily while away dozens of hours in this portable version as it is in its console and PC counterparts."", '(This review will focus primarily on the Vita-specific strengths and limitations of Borderlands 2. To read a more in-depth analysis of the game in general, check out our original Borderlands 2 review.)', ' ', 'In any transition from console or PC to the Vita, there is a question of controls. The Vita has fewer button inputs than other platforms, and this often necessitates the use of touchscreens for buttons, often with mixed results. In Borderlands 2, the default control scheme puts some pretty important actions on the front and rear touchpads. Some of my battles got a little more heated due to a sprint or a melee attack not registering on the first tap, but for the most part, I was able to act when I wanted to, and my co-op partners reported no troubles (you can also freely remap the buttons if a particular input is tricky for you).', ""Combat in Borderlands 2 is naturally a bit floaty and loose, largely due to way player movement and enemy behavior are paced. As a result, it can accommodate the small degree of control imprecision added by the touchscreens and be none the worse for it. Likewise, the smaller range of motion of the analog sticks may cause some making the PC/console transition to balk a bit, and indeed, aiming can initially feel ungainly if you're used to the game on other platforms. After you adjust the aim sensitivity and spend some time wandering the wastelands, however, the mercenary satisfactions of long-range headshots and up-close bullet barrages are well within reach."", ""And taking on enemies in Borderlands 2 is very satisfying. Raving psychos that run toward you in serpentine patterns, heavy flamethrower troops that wield bulky shields, speedy lizards that can turn invisible and teleport, lumbering insects that spew corrosive acid, giant attack robots that build other robots, and shotgun-wielding midgets that jump out of lockers are just some of the diverse forces arrayed against you. To combat them, you arm yourself with a standard variety of weapon types made distinctly nonstandard by varying scopes, firing patterns, and elemental effects. Throw in a wide selection of grenades, shields that can damage enemies, and your character's customizable action skill, and you've got a lot of different strategic options. Marshaling these options and bringing gleeful destruction to your enemies is a lot of fun, and the variety of adversaries and environments helps keep combat fresh many hours into the game. "", ' ', ""During full-on firefights there can be a lot happening onscreen, and here's where the Vita struggles. The frame rate slows down and makes things look choppier, adding a bit more chaos to an already chaotic situation. On another platform, you might feel like you still have a grip on things when the action gets frantic; on the Vita, that grip is a bit more tenuous. In many cases, it's just an added nuisance, but in the worst moments, it's another consideration you must add to your decision-making process. Lining up your sniper shot takes a little more patience, and your berserk shotgun rampages have to be a little more wild; it feels like you need to exaggerate whatever your chosen play style is, or maybe get comfortable with having less control."", ""But this isn't to say that everything spirals out of control when the frame rate suffers; the effect is not nearly that severe. There are a lot of elements that combine to make combat in Borderlands 2 chaotic and satisfying, and while the frame rate adds to the former and not the latter, it doesn't tip the scales. This still feels like proper Borderlands 2 action, complete with all the thrills and challenges that it boasts on PCs and consoles. The cycle of exploring the world, vanquishing enemies (who vanish in a spurt of blood instead of melting or falling down or whatever else they do in the other versions), and collecting loot is still enthralling."", ""This cycle gets even better when you play with a friend, something that is no less true even though you can team up with only one other player on Vita, as opposed to three. You need an online connection, though, because there's no local connection option. You can ask the game to find a match for you, or peruse the available matches in a list, and after a lengthy loading screen, you're in the action seamlessly. Whether someone joins your game or you join someone else's, the frame rate issues are about the same, so it's generally as smooth as playing by yourself. Playing with someone else not only adds the usual camaraderies, it also lets you use complementary abilities and tactics, pits you against tougher enemies, and gives you bigger rewards. It's like playing a souped-up version of the game, and it's great."", ""Of course, you might end up with someone who just constantly asks to trade weapons and leaves when you don't comply; such is the risk of all online play. The built-in Vita mic is also active by default, which could either be a great way to communicate and make a new friend, or an annoyance that you quickly mute. The audio landscape in Borderlands 2 is already quite crowded, given all the sound effects, enemy taunts, character quips, dialogue, and voice-over lines. Many of these effects sound flatter and less rich than they do on consoles and PC, even through headphones, and occasionally dialogue lines or effects drop out and leave a conspicuous silence. The lines dropped tend to be prioritized well, though, so you aren't likely to miss any crucial dialogue. This leaves you free to enjoy the irreverent and relentless humor, which is one of the game's greatest strengths. "", 'Audio and video in Borderlands 2 seem to push the limits of what the Vita can handle, but the system merely strains and does not break (though the game did crash once or twice in my dozen or so hours with it). The Vita version also comes with two of the sizable downloadable mission packs, two extra playable characters, and an assortment of bonus goodies. And you can take advantage of the cross-save capability if you own Borderlands 2 on the PlayStation 3. The result is an impressive package that delivers exciting combat, hilarious dialogue, entertaining quests, and delightful rewards.']"Brett Todd,6-Jun-14,Kill the Bad Guy Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/kill-the-bad-guy-review/1900-6415785/,7,PC,"[""Sometimes a title really an get the point across. Set-piece puzzler Kill the Bad Guy lays your motives bare with its blunt moniker, which nicely sums up your primary goal. The game has you murdering a rogues' gallery of ne'er-do-wells via assassinations that play out like gory outtakes from old cartoons, and lets you see the real aftermath of Elmer Fudd shooting Daffy Duck in the face. Yes, this is a game about killing, but it's a fun, lightweight game about killing that mostly succeeds by blending cunning logic- and physics-based puzzles with a great sense of humor relating to the daydream revenge fantasies that we all have about taking out everyone from serial killers to that guy in the Volvo who just cut you off."", ""The single-player-only Kill the Bad Guy puts you in the employ of an international guild of assassins out to kill every villain who ever got off on a technicality, escaped the long arm of the law, set up a terrorist attack, parked in a handicapped spot, and so forth. You do so by rigging up various traps that allow the murders to look like accidents, presumably because any half-decent international guild of assassins wouldn't want its dirty work winding up on the cover of the New York Post. Everything takes place in real time, although you can pause the action or even speed it up to zip past dull spots when you're waiting for your victim to get into position for the kill."", ""Each of the 60 levels (split into six chapters with 10 levels in each) included in the game is a small set-piece affair that involves no more than a couple of city blocks. The bad guy enters on one side of the map--which is sparsely populated by stores, vehicles, garbage trucks, pedestrians, and so forth--and walks around a set route until he exits a minute or so later. Everything is given a surreal, art-house style, with most of the backdrop presented in black and white. Only the bad guys really stand out, because they come equipped with colorful sporty jackets (think Starter in the '90s), faces painted with bull's-eye targets, and loads of bright red blood, which tends to end up smeared all over the landscape by the close of each level."", ""Dark objects in levels can be manipulated with basic left and right clicks of the mouse, while light ones are just part of the scenery. How and when you manipulate these objects is where the puzzle part of the game comes into play. Victims don't just stroll straight to their deaths, so you need to adjust the landscape to both nudge them into the right spots and set up various kooky traps. You can indirectly guide bad guys by putting obstacles in their way. So whenever you want to discourage targets from going down a street, you throw a stop sign in their way, or the glass from a broken bottle, or even a dead dog. Or lure them where you want them to go with goodies like porno mags and, um, French bread."", 'The trick is not being seen. At first, you just have to avoid the viewing cone of the victim (which can be toggled on and off), because he flees in panic if he spots anything suspicious (oddly enough, dropping a dead dog directly in front of somebody produces a pretty dramatic reaction). But later levels introduce patrolling cops, police cruisers, pedestrians, security cameras, and the like. Commit any sort of criminal act in front of them, and you instantly fail the mission.', 'Kill the Bad Guy murders are always pulled off in elaborate ways reminiscent of Saturday-morning cartoons as reimagined by Edward Gorey. Falling pianos, explosive manhole covers, runaway cars, flaming pools of oil, and more all figure into the mayhem here. You might combine a rope with a crate and then hang the contraption on a building for the moment that your target walks past. Or rig up a wannabe catapult with some parking stanchions and a metal bar from a nearby construction site. Or spill some water and then cut a power cable right as a bad guy is getting his feet wet.', ""This is a game about killing, but it's a fun, lightweight game about killing that mostly succeeds by blending cunning logic- and physics-based puzzles with a great sense of humor."", 'Objects function in realistic, physics-based ways, but the game features sort of a ""horseshoes and hand grenades"" leeway where you can generally kill a baddie by getting reasonably close with a falling crate, an explosive, or a runaway lawn mower. You can never be foiled by any didn\'t-quite-get-me moments reminiscent of the grinning pigs in Angry Birds. Get close enough, and you can guarantee that you\'ll soon be seeing a screaming, flaming corpse-in-waiting running frantically around the map.', ""Trapping and killing are imaginative and fun for the most part. There are a lot of chuckles to be had, as well as some devious plots to concoct. Levels offer a fair bit of replay value. There are almost always multiple ways to kill targets, as well as bonus goals like finding a victim's passport and grabbing the tooth that always pops out of a bad guy as he expires. Levels fly by, too, making this a very catchy game you can play on the fly when you have only a few minutes to spare. You can whip through even the toughest levels in little more than 10 minutes, and the average and easy ones can generally be solved in no more than a couple of minutes on your first attempt."", ""But the developers don't push the design enough, and repetition is a problem. There are really just a handful of go-to ways to kill bad guys, so the thrill eventually evaporates from even wacky murders, such as slingshotting a dead dog onto somebody's head. Each of the game's six chapters also brings in a new gameplay element, like the aforementioned security cameras, and then the next few missions are fairly easy introductions to this added feature. As a result, the game isn't as challenging as it could be."", ""The dark humor sometimes goes a little too far. Bad guys are given biographies in the splash screens before each assignment. Most are irreverent and goofy, but some reveal that you're taking on too-close-to-home villains like one of the Columbine killers, serial killer Albert Fish, and even Hitler. Profiling these real-life monsters with the game's blackly humorous text can be a little off-putting."", ""Even though Kill the Bad Guy has its moments, it's never quite as challenging or as engaging as it could be. The biggest problem may be the platform. Such lightweight and casual play would likely work better on a phone or a tablet, especially at a cheaper price than the $14.99 sticker virtually attached to this Steam-distributed game. Still, even with these flaws, this is a diverting, innovative puzzler with more than enough charm to make staging loony-tunes murders look like an appealing pastime.""]"Mark Walton,6-Jun-14,Tomodachi Life Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tomodachi-life-review/1900-6415783/,7,3DS,"[""A cross between The Sims, Animal Crossing, and the stranger parts of otaku culture, Tomodachi Life is a game that's unashamedly Japanese. At times it's hilarious; at other times it's utterly bewildering. Your animated collection of Miis need to be fed and watered, and their wants for the finer things in their virtual lives satisfied. They cry out to be played with in wonderfully odd minigames, and update you with the latest happenings on their island home from behind a suitably cheesy news desk. Tomodachi Life is the Tamagotchi all grown up. But, like that piece of '90s virtual pet nostalgia, it wasn't enough to keep me entertained once the novelty wore off."", ""Still, Tomodachi Life is quite the wacky novelty while it lasts, particularly if you're populating your virtual island with friends and family from your own life--or, in my case, members of the GameSpot UK crew. You can create some eerily recognizable caricatures of your chums using the standard Mii creation tools, along with the new customizable voices for the game's text-to-speech engine. Granted, the text-to-speech engine isn't the most flattering, but its slightly robotic qualities add to the kitsch charm of the game. Likewise, a set of assignable attributes, such as how much energy your Miis have or how serious or light their moods are, add personality and generate a specific profile for each one. That profile isn't just for show, either. Likes, dislikes, how needy they are, how often they need to be fed, and their compatibility with other Miis are all linked into each character's personality profile."", ""Disappointingly, that same level of customization doesn't apply to the island itself, which is built up automatically--not that you don't already have your hands full. Needy Miis cry out for food as soon as they've set foot in their shared apartment block, while others demand new clothes, or a new premade look for their bare home. Shops scattered around the island are stocked with an eclectic range of cuisines and items from the familiar to the downright bizarre to spoil your Miis with. Edibles like spaghetti Bolognese from Italy, roast beef from England, and beef bourguignon from France--complete with quirky real-life pictures--make up the cuisine, while checked shirts, summer dresses, and more esoteric items like ice cream hats and firefighter uniforms make up the outfits."", 'There\'s lots of fun to be had dressing up your friends in the most absurd outfits and watching their faces wince as they fail to appreciate the stylistic pleasures of a ""harem pants and giant strawberry hat"" combo. But while these crimes against fashion certainly raise a smile, ultimately you need to keep your Miis happy. Stick them in an unflattering outfit or feed them an unappetizing stuffed cabbage roll one too many times, and their happiness rating, and the money they give you as a reward, takes a hit. It\'s a simplistic system, and outside of receiving gifts like Wii U consoles, frying pans, and incredibly cheesy songs to sing inside the island\'s concert hall (complete with customizable lyrics), your characters barely develop as they level up. As you discover, though, an unhappy islander is not a productive one, particularly when it comes to making friends and developing relationships.', ""Tomodachi Life revolves around relationships, be they romantic or otherwise. Happy islanders ask to make friends, want to introduce people, or declare their undying love for a friend with alarming regularity. They don't always hit it off, particularly if you give them bad advice in the small-talk department, but once friends, they're often at each other's apartment hanging out. You do have the option of telling a Mii not to make friends with another, but expect the dark rain clouds of depression to be (literally) floating over their heads while they get over it. As reported by GameSpot, Miis of the same sex can be friends, but they can never fall in love or go on to propose via a strange but amusing minigame where you have to tap your romantic spiel out in time to the thought bubbles of your partner."", ""Hammering the heterosexual point home is the ranking board, which displays the vital stats of your islanders, including the most popular and most pampered, and, yes, how desirable your female inhabitants are to the boys. At least Nintendo has gone on the record to say that if the game gets a sequel, it'll be more inclusive. Still, it's hard to take these inclusions and omissions too seriously when attached to a game as absurd as this one, even if Nintendo should do better."", ""Once you've got your Miis married off, populating your island with children or gifting items to other islands via StreetPass, there's not a whole lot else to do. The rankings, experience points, and your Miis development (or rather, lack of it) simply aren't deep enough to hold your attention for long. There are plenty of amusing moments, like the cringe-worthy rap battles that happen by the island's fountain, or the minigames that have you picking baby crabs off a Mii with a disembodied human hand and playing a facsimile of an old-school Japanese role-playing game, but these are one-shot deals in the humor department; once you've seen them, the charm soon wears off."", ""What you're left with is a sophisticated Tamagotchi, and a repetitive cycle of feeding, nursing, and entertaining that is hardly the most absorbing of pastimes. A much deeper system of development for Miis would have gone a long way towards keeping things interesting. That said, there are so many hilarious and curiously bizarre moments to be found along the way that even if the journey to fully fledged family life is a short one before the repetition sets in, it's well worth the trip.""]"Heidi Kemps,5-Jun-14,Mind Zero Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mind-zero-review/1900-6415784/,4,PlayStation Vita,"[""There's a notorious production company called The Asylum. It's not involved with gaming (at least, not yet), but you might know the company as the folks behind such films as Transmorphers, The Day the Earth Stopped, Atlantic Rim, and Android Cop. Its modus operandi is making half-baked films--mockbusters--that clearly want to ride on the themes and popularity of much more visible properties, while trying to remain different enough that they aren't completely wholesale rip-offs of a source."", ""Why do I mention this? Because Mind Zero feels like The Asylum's version of the Persona series. The similarity of the setting, story concepts, and overall design is undeniable. And like the inept mockbuster trying desperately to re-create the spectacle of its bigger inspiration, Mind Zero fails at anything beyond being occasionally mediocre."", ""The premise behind Mind Zero sounds familiar: in modern-day Saitama, Japan, mysterious happenings are afoot, with random people going on violent rampages due to a force called MIND. While the police are investigating these freak occurrences, a group of high school kids stumble into a portal to a strange alternate world where they are given weapons and told the secrets of MINDs: they are parallel beings from another world. Some MINDs are leaking out into the world we know and are preying on people with negative emotions, and it's up to a scrappy team of kids (plus a grizzled supernatural detective) to investigate and stop the MINDs from opening doors from their world to ours, all while keeping their special powers a secret from the police."", 'Sound a bit familiar? It might, because it\'s basically the plot of all of the various Persona games stitched together like some sort of Frankenstein\'s monster. And much like said creature, Mind Zero\'s plot trudges along with the speed of molasses for a good chunk of the game. Even in the most cinematic-heavy Japanese role-playing games, there are usually things developing in the story when you\'re not dungeon-crawling. Mind Zero takes its sweet time just getting past the basic ""MINDs are bad; let\'s find and fight them"" conceit into something more substantial.', ""But while other RPGs might emphasize interactions between characters to help make up for a weak main plot, Mind Zero gives you a cast of teenagers whose personalities fall into one of two categories: incredibly irritating all the time or about as well defined and interesting as a brick. The lead character, Kei, is so aloof and angsty that he may as well have been a mass-produced unit purchased straight from JRPG Hero Stereotype Industries Inc. It wasn't long after my introduction to him that I was wishing I could have a silent lead this time."", ""Mind Zero's plot trudges along with the speed of molasses for a good chunk of the game."", 'Other characters have one-note traits and are easily summed up in single sentences: ""He won\'t shut up ever about buying dumb crap,"" ""She\'s kind of stupid in a way that\'s supposed to be endearing but isn\'t,"" ""She has no discernible personality to speak of, but she fights stuff, so she\'s OK,"" and so on. The game\'s most interesting characters end up being Ogata, the grizzled detective and sole adult on your team, and the antagonists that emerge later on. The sheer dullness or unlikability of everyone makes the game\'s attempts to present short vignettes of interaction between characters (akin to Persona\'s social-link sequences) laughable.', ""The combat and exploration are better than the story, though that's not really saying much. Dungeons are presented as first-person-view mazes, and a map fills out as you explore, making things much easier for you--especially since the dungeons become quite expansive, quite fast. What they never really become, however, is attractive. The visuals for these settings are bland and uninspired (the fact that setting assets are recycled by the third major dungeon is seriously off-putting), and the layout of the mazes is sprawling and confusing, with only a few uninteresting gimmicks to break up the monotony."", ""Combat, however, has a few interesting elements. Up to three characters can participate in combat, and they have three separate meters each: life points, mind points, and technical points. Life points are pretty easy to grasp: lose them all, and the character is out of commission. Mind points determine the health of a character's MIND; these points recover over time unless the MIND is on-field. Finally, technical points are used to activate skills of MINDs. They also recover over the course of combat."", ""These gauges are all very important to keep track of, because they all affect the most crucial element of combat in Mind Zero: the usage of the MINDs, which are summoned with the R trigger. Characters have differing sets of commands depending on whether or not their MINDs are active on the field: defense, item, and escape commands can only be used sans a MIND, while skills are only available with MINDs summoned. MINDs alter other elements as well. Normally, whenever characters are attacked by enemies, they lose LP. However, if their MINDs are active when characters are hit, they lose MP instead of LP, thus rendering MINDs as something of a protective shield. If all MP is lost to attacks, however, characters' MINDs are broken, and the characters are stunned and unable to summon their MINDs again for a few turns. This adds an element of risk to simply putting one's MIND out as a meatshield against enemies."", ""Active MINDs improve standard attack power slightly and give access to skills, which consume TP and sometimes LP when used. The number of skills that can be equipped is determined by a character's level, and skill-granting cards can be equipped, enhanced, and shuffled about from character to character outside of combat. Assembling a solid skill set is crucial to success, though the skills' interchangeability robs characters of individual combat importance, so you'll tend to focus on leveling up a few characters, which may come back to bite you at certain story points. Finally, there's the burst command, which can be used with MINDs turned on or off. Burst allows for a command to be executed instantaneously at a significant TP cost--it's an expensive godsend when emergency healing, absolute escape, or immediate fatal damage on a foe is needed."", ""All of these aspects to fighting seem as if they should be great, and there are boss battles where the combat elements get a chance to shine. The problem comes from the sheer tedium of the regular enemy encounters, and the constant difficulty spikes that accompany them. There's really no such thing as a quick battle in Mind Zero: enemies not only soak up and deal a lot of damage (even on the lowest difficulty), but they also have elemental and anti-MIND affiliations that you must pay attention to."", ""It's one thing for random RPG battles to require you to at least pay attention to not suffer an embarrassing death, but the amount of command shuffling, MIND toggling, and bursting just to kill some cannon-fodder is downright annoying, especially when you just want to explore and get somewhere. Making it all worse is the massive difficulty spike that arrives with each new dungeon; you'll be finishing many fights by the skin of your teeth until you can eke out a couple of extra levels for your crew each time there's a new location introduced. After just a few hours in, you grow to loathe the random encounters (and the irritating music that accompanies them), but at least you'll be thankful for the R button fast-forward feature to make them slightly less of a pain."", 'There are a few high points beyond good combat ideas: the artwork for the MINDs and characters is nice, and the localization gives conversations a natural flow, but the snoozefest of a story and monotonous encounters make playing Mind Zero feel like work. To top it all off, the finale is atrocious, failing to deliver any answers to the questions the story poses (and, in fact, creating new ones), all while suggesting a follow-up that may or may not ever happen. After the utterly laborious process of completing the game, the unsatisfying finale is a slap in the face. But hey, at least you get a post-game dungeon to slog through!', ""The Vita isn't hurting for JRPGs, but even if you've already played and finished Demon Gaze, Ys: Memories of Celceta, and Persona 4 Golden, it's best to skip Mind Zero. Like The Asylum's film oeuvre, Mind Zero is capable, at times, of at least holding your attention, but it's rarely entertaining, and when you're done, you'll be wondering why you didn't invest your time in a superior alternative instead.""]"Tom Mc Shea,5-Jun-14,Murdered: Soul Suspect Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/murdered-soul-suspect-review/1900-6415781/,6,PS4,"[""There are strange events unfolding in Salem, Massachusetts, and it has nothing to do with the growing ghost population.

Or maybe they embark on a guided tour of the local graveyard, where centuries of restless spirits glide along the foggy paths. To question their puzzling actions during such a stressful period is to understand how dissimilar their decisions are from what you'd expect from a rational being.

This is the rare game that has problems you could count off on your fingers--flaccid visual design, overly dramatic score, underdeveloped characters--but that overcomes its missteps to provide an adventure laced with the empathy of a human-interest story and the constant dread of a well-realized ghost tale. Laugh all you want at Soul Suspect, but it has serious heart as well.', ""Things get off to a rocky start, not only for the game in question but for its beleaguered protagonist. Ronan is a street-thug-turned-cop whose life story is told through extensive tattoos spread across his body. We see him perish in the opening cutscene, killed by a hooded assailant whose motives, we can deduce, are far from pure. It's then that you embody Ronan's ghost, desperate to solve the mystery of the murder that suddenly ended his life. Such a setup could have provided a solid structure to build upon. However, Ronan's tough-guy act is so painfully generic that there's little more to his characterization than puffing on a ghostly cigarette. He's a stoic blank slate who never made me care who his killer was."", 'Even though it wears its many faults so openly, Murdered: Soul Suspect manages to demand your attention until the chilling end.', ""Such a major problem could have derailed this entire adventure, but as Soul Suspect slowly gains its footing, there's more here than a tired protagonist. Ronan's ethereal nature gives him voyeuristic powers that serve to shed light on the people--alive and dead--who still roam the streets of Salem. Much of Soul Suspect involves walking casually through the desolate city. Because you're a ghost, the barriers can't rein Ronan in, so walls are nothing more than opaque passageways. As you examine locales, you discover clues peppered about, filling in details of who you are and where you've come from, along with myriad tidbits about those who inhabit this world with you. And it's piecing together this intricate puzzle that serves as the most interesting aspect of Soul Suspect."", ""You may come across ghosts who are still stranded in purgatory because they have unfinished business. Clues are strewn about that, once collected and assembled, spell out the causes of their deaths, which have kept them trapped in Salem, and there's inherent pleasure in seeing their troubled stories through to completion. Maybe the boy upset that his drunk driving was the cause of death for his friends and himself can find respite in knowing the truth, or a drowned woman might learn that her death was not in vain. These characters only exist in these small situations, so we don't learn much about who they are. But I felt much closer to the characters when I put their fears to rest, so I welcomed Ronan's knack for investigating."", ""Other times, you hear only a snatch of information about stranded ghosts, understanding why they haven't moved on to the afterlife without having any chance to save them. There's a college guy who doesn't realize that a fraternity prank went horribly wrong, and a woman suffering deep regret over her own suicide. These views into people's psyches are affecting because it's easy to understand their mindsets even though you spend such little time with them. How trusting that frat-boy pledge was, and how he suffered for what should have been a virtue. And how sad it was to see a woman overwhelmed by her own troubling thoughts, and how desperate she is to reverse her rash decision. These characters felt real in ways I had not expected and pushed me onward to see who else was out there."", ""If only I didn't need to make so many excuses for the rest of Soul Suspect. There are forced combat encounters against roving demons that make no sense compared to the slow-paced scenes that encompass the rest of the game. Granted, it takes no more than a couple of minutes to get the jump on these prowling reapers, but these scenes still provide only an annoyance that detracts from Soul Suspect's strengths. And then there's a baffling stealth section in which you must help your medium friend sneak through a building that she already has permission to be in. Talk about a forced challenge. Plus, as you're searching for clues in the environments, objects flicker as if they're crossing between two planes, and you can't tell if you've already interacted with them or there's more to do. Much of the action in Soul Suspect feels sloppy, so that you're often fighting to progress instead of helping the story unfold."", ""At least Soul Suspect's many problems serve as laughable tonal shifts rather than frustrating dead ends. Take, for instance, the rare moments when you must possess a cat. Not only does this look incredibly goofy, but by tapping the otherwise useless meow button, its silly mouth moves like a feline puppet. This is good for comic relief but doesn't exactly fit within the rest of the game. Then there are the contradictory thoughts of the citizens whose minds you can enter. The guy who loves being in a small town but regrets that there's nothing to do is all over the map, and it's sad how many people the developer believes are locked in psychiatric wards because they see bugs crawling up walls. It's a cheap way to exhibit mental problems."", ""Despite these issues, at no point was I disenchanted by Soul Suspect. Even though I recognized how ludicrous the game often was, I was still invested in the story that was slowly unfolding. Finding the many pieces to hear the troubling truth of a psychiatric ward was well worth the searching it required, so I never got deterred by Soul Suspect's weakness. The strongest story thread belongs to your wife, Julia. She grappled with her feelings for Ronan, struggling to rationalize why she was attracted to a man with so many problems. And she had mental issues of her own, which caused her to question her life choices. Uncovering the details of her life made me care about Soul Sacrifice much more than the flimsy relationship I built with Ronan ever could."", ""Murdered: Soul Suspect is as troubled as its protagonist. There are so many problems--from the presentation to the story and even technical hiccups--that I was continually pulled out of the experience. And yet, I continued on, and I'm glad that I wasn't overwhelmed by those missteps. It's empowering to piece together the sad details of the people you encounter, and that element was strong enough to keep me engaged throughout. Murdered: Soul Suspect has a lot more spirit than its taciturn protagonist could ever muster."", ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ']"Carolyn Petit,5-Jun-14,Pushmo World Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/pushmo-world-review/1900-6415782/,7,Wii U,"[""I always love it when a game has a limited range of incredibly simple mechanics that you grasp immediately, but that you find allow for lots of complexity once you actually start putting those mechanics to use. You see this in great recent action games like Nidhogg, Samurai Gunn, and Towerfall. And in a very different way, you see it in Pushmo World. This is a puzzle game that initially pulls you in with its simple gameplay and tranquil tone, but keeps you absorbed with spatial puzzles that have a pleasingly tactile feel and sometimes require a level of focus that has you forgetting about your worldly troubles. Pushmo World doesn't do much that Pushmo didn't do already, and it's not as natural a fit for a console as it is for a handheld, but it's still a reliably good puzzle game that gives you more of what made the original Pushmo a success."", 'As in the original 3DS game, you play as Mallo, a character who looks like a marshmallowy, sumo-wrestling cat, but who never demonstrates either the agility we normally associate with felines or the strength in physical combat that we associate with sumo wrestlers. Instead, Mallo rescues babies who have somehow gotten trapped in the puzzles (called ""pushmo"") that the aptly named Pushmo Park is filled with. The parents of the region clearly need some guidance in how to prevent their poor infants from becoming enclosed in these puzzles, but until that happens, Mallo is there to come to the rescue.', ""It wouldn't surprise me if, in his heart of hearts, Mallo is glad that the babies in the area are again in need of rescue just so he has an excuse to solve those puzzles. But alas, the deeper realms of Mallo's psyche will have to be explored only in Pushmo fan fiction--the focus here, thankfully, is entirely on the puzzles themselves. Each pushmo starts out as a flat, colorful mural of sorts, made up of separate panels, and you manipulate the puzzles by pushing and pulling on those panels."", ""Your goal in each pushmo is to reach the baby atop one of the panels, and pushing, pulling, walking and taking short leaps are your only means of interacting directly with the puzzles. Reaching the baby at the summit can be quite challenging, requiring you to concentrate on understanding the puzzle in three-dimensional space, and it's the way that the puzzles take hold in your brain as tangible, three-dimensional objects that you can manipulate in easily understandable ways that makes these puzzles absorbing. It's relaxing to focus so intently on the pushmo, and there's a pleasant sense of progress as you find yourself getting a better grasp on the logic required to solve some of them."", ""This isn't to say that the game becomes easy, though; as you progress, puzzles become larger and more intricate, requiring more steps to solve. And they introduce gadgets like colored manholes (hop in a manhole of a certain color here and you'll pop out of the corresponding manhole elsewhere on the puzzle) and switches that, when stepped on, make panels of a particular color pop out or retract."", ""Pushmo World becomes quite challenging, but it's hard to pull yourself away because you know that the solution is right in front of you, that all you have to do is push and pull the panels in the right order to make your way to the top. How hard can it be? Pushmo World eases you into its challenge with a training area that introduces you to new concepts as they arise, and it lets you skip any puzzles that just aren't clicking for you. Pushmo World is the sort of game in which sometimes, if you come back to a puzzle that previously stumped you with fresh eyes, the solution is so apparent, you wonder how you didn't see it before."", ""You can also create your own pushmo using the easy and intuitive editor and send them to other players as QR codes, as well as visit the Pushmo World Fair to play pushmo created by other players, though this feature wasn't available to test during the writing of this review. Given the importance of spatial awareness in solving pushmo, the 3D capabilities of the 3DS made it a particularly good fit for these puzzles, and hunkering down in your living room with a console to play a puzzle or two doesn't feel quite as breezy as playing them on the go, so Pushmo World isn't quite the revelation on Wii U that Pushmo was on the 3DS. But the logic of these colorful puzzles is still as satisfying as ever.""]"Maxwell McGee,3-Jun-14,Ultra Street Fighter IV Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ultra-street-fighter-iv-review/1900-6415780/,8,Xbox 360,"['With Ultra Street Fighter IV, the masterful Street Fighter IV series has reached its fifth, and possibly final, incarnation. Five years of tournaments, balance patches, and community input have coalesced to form the definitive version of a fighter that continues to evolve to this day. In his review, former GameSpot editor Dan Chiappini described Street Fighter IV as ""undoubtedly one of the finest examples of the fighting genre in this generation."" It\'s a worthy accolade, and one that still holds true today.', ""Ultra Street Fighter IV brings with it a whole host of changes and additions to the game's previous releases: Super Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition and its 2012 update. Six new stages, five new characters, and three new game mechanics are successfully integrated into an already feature-rich game and introduce new strategies that help keep this seasoned fighter feeling fresh."", ""Any major Street Fighter expansion wouldn't be complete without adding some new fighters to the fray. Poison, Rolento, Hugo, and Elena will be instantly recognizable to Street Fighter fans from their recent outing in Street Fighter X Tekken. However, these characters aren't just cut-and-paste copies from SFXT; instead, they have been reworked to fit naturally within SFIV's play style. Newcomer Decapre rounds out the roster. While she bears a striking resemblance to another world warrior, Decapre has her own distinct fighting style, which deftly mixes charge-based attacks with rushdown tactics, two fighting styles that traditionally do not mix."", ""Outside of the five new challengers, Ultra Street Fighter IV brings with it a myriad of tweaks and changes for the existing cast. None of the existing 39 characters have gone untouched in this expansion; however, the bulk of those changes will likely go unnoticed to the untrained eye. Increasing the damage of Rose's crouching light punch by 10 or reducing the startup of Dudley's medium kick by one frame may not sound like much on paper, but taken as a whole, these changes and dozens more combine to create a more equally balanced roster."", ""While the character-specific tweaks are not as apparent, ultra combo double, red focus attacks, and delayed wake-up are much more disruptive additions to the core mechanics of Street Fighter IV. The ultra combo double is a third ultra combo option that lets you go into battle armed with both of your character's ultra combos, but at reduced damage for both. This gives you more options in the fight, and is an especially effective addition for characters such as Zangief who have both antiair and close-range ultras."", ""A red focus attack functions in much the same way as the standard focus attack, except that it can absorb multiple hits at the cost of one energy block. This makes it a great tool for absorbing multi-hit attacks--looking at you, E. Honda--or for punishing a random ultra combo. Rounding out the trio is the delayed wake-up. Being able to delay when your character rises is a much more subtle addition, but an important one nonetheless. The delay does not last long, but it is enough to throw off the timing of a practiced opponent's next attack. Together, these three changes have a tremendous impact on the higher-level strategies of Street Fighter IV and offer new strategies for series veterans."", ""Ultra Street Fighter IV's updates don't stop at its characters. Online, you can compete in the new Elimination mode or work alongside distant friends in the Online Training mode. Elimination is a competitive mode where two teams of three duke it out to see which team is the best. When a player is defeated, the next one on his or her team swaps in until one side has no combatants left. To help prevent one player from steamrolling an entire team, Elimination mode does not restore health between rounds (naturally) or matches, similar in structure to the King of Fighters series."", ""A couple of new options for the truly dedicated round out Training mode. Save states let you take a snapshot of the current battle and return to it at any time with the push of a button. This is a handy addition for those who want to practice location-specific attacks or combos rapid-fire without having to reset the character blocking over and over again. Network simulation is the other upgrade, but it's really more of a novelty. This option lets you simulate increasingly severe levels of input lag to make you feel as if you're playing against someone with a poor Internet connection."", ""While so much of Street Fighter IV has been touched up in this new expansion, Trials mode continues to receive the cold shoulder. This mode is now horribly out of date and still uses character data from Super Street Fighter IV. It lacks trials for all five of Ultra's newcomers, as well as the previous batch of newcomers: Evil Ryu, Oni, Yun, and Yang. Since this mode is a good way to get acquainted with new characters, it's disappointing to see that developer Capcom has not yet updated it. Capcom has said it plans to release some sort of update later on down the line, but the absence of a fully realized Trials mode is certainly felt."", 'Trials aside, Ultra Street Fighter IV is a great expansion that smartly builds upon the core game. With all of its tweaks, new mechanics, and extra game modes, Ultra will definitely appeal to the diehard Street Fighter IV fans who still remember the tyranny of vanilla Sagat. Nearly every aspect of the game has received some sort of enhancement or upgrade, and the result is an expansion that makes a great game even better.']"Cameron Woolsey,2-Jun-14,Project Temporality Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/project-temporality-review/1900-6415779/,4,PC,"['Project Temporality candidly sets you on familiar territory. It heavily borrows themes and mechanics from some of the top games in its genre, but not enough to recapture the spark of life found in such classics. As subject 87, you pass through the rooms and hallways of a futuristic space station, manipulating time to solve puzzles--typically involving large buttons and doors. You are overseen by a man whose relentless pursuit of a successful experiment has left the station a nearly abandoned wreck, and subject 87 is seemingly the last among many subjects who failed to live up to expectations.', 'Project Temporality makes some clear nods to Valve\'s Portal, but mentioning it in the same breath gives the game far too much credit. The game isn\'t nearly as clever, and its attempts at humor come off as juvenile and awkward, which gets worse as you near its end. The head of the operation is Admiral Melville, and like GLaDOS, he is an apparently calm tutor, familiarizing you with puzzle-solving mechanics, but he goes completely wacky over the course of the game. But unlike those of his sharp and often sarcastic robotic counterpart, Melville\'s speeches devolve into didactic rambling and bizarre insults. The laughter I experienced was more a response to the baffling spectacle than to any genuine comedy. It was because of this that I felt exceedingly relieved that the game doesn\'t include any vocal work. I would feel nothing but pity for the poor soul who had to strain through gritted teeth, ""I will eat your children and make a sock puppet out of your face!"" with any sort of sincerity.', ""You would believe the actions of subject 87 to be the catalyst that sparks the change needed to finally end the madness and set things right. Instead, the story spins around you at a distance, occasionally brushing by to remind you that it still exists. Subject 87's actions do nothing for plot progression; any and all attempts to advance the story are performed by other characters as they speak to you via covert messages. The perpetually silent 87 gets pushed along for the ride as the story struggles in vain to try to make the hapless character a significant part of the narrative."", 'You are likely to find more enjoyment if you just ignore the story and focus on the main reason you would delve into Project Temporality: the puzzle solving. An experimental brain implant grants you the ability to clear challenges by spawning time clones that act out a few moments of your last action. This should sound familiar if you played Ratchet & Clank Future: A Crack in Time, where Clank completed puzzles by creating colored time clones. The simplest challenges have you open a door by holding down a button some distance away. The button may need to be held down to keep the door open, or pressing it could begin a countdown that reaches zero just as you encounter the door.', ""Project Temporality makes some clear nods to Valve's Portal, but mentioning it in the same breath gives the game far too much credit."", 'In short, you must be in two places at once. To solve this riddle, you start at or near the door you must pass through and walk toward the button that opens it. When you reach it, you hit rewind and until you\'re where you need to be, and then create a time clone that follows the exact path to the button and presses it down, allowing you to enter the door. The mechanic excited me when I first saw it executed. I loved watching my past self follow the same path, perhaps smacking against the same barrel I did by mistake, and ending up on the button across a room just as planned. I wanted to wave, jump up, and shout ""Thanks for the hand, me!"" before moving to the next room, leaving my clone to stand guard, perhaps for an eternity. Naturally, the puzzles get far more complicated than the example I presented. Throughout the game, you face burning lasers, roving platforms, pitfalls, and motion sensors, and passing through them unscathed can take many clones at once.', 'Solving puzzles requires nonlinear planning, combined with a bit of imagination. Success means knowing exactly where you must be at all times--in the present, the past, and also the future. In one challenge, you must cross a chasm on a floating platform, while also having to move a large wall in order to block a laser placed in such a way as to knock you clear into the abyss. In another, you hold down a button for a door and set up a clone to press a second button, leaving you to pick up a key needed to bypass a room, all within seconds. Both challenges have you using your imagination to place yourself somewhere in the future, whether that means standing on the platform that passes by a laser-blocking wall just in the nick of time, or grabbing a key and escaping by using your ability to create clones.', 'Unfortunately, once you grasp the fundamentals of the puzzles, the fun in solving them withers. Puzzles don\'t vary much throughout the 14 levels, and never require more than precise timing and pressing a seemingly endless supply of large glowing buttons. The game isn\'t wholly devoid of challenge, mind. Project Temporality\'s difficulty progression is organic, and the game provides a few real head-scratchers. The problem is that it gets to the point where you can enter a room and discern exactly how to complete the puzzle just by glancing at the components. This does not originate from a sudden burst of intuition; you\'ve just danced these steps so many times they\'ve started to wear holes in the station\'s reinforced metal floors. And without those satisfying ""Aha!"" moments that make puzzle games so engrossing, Project Temporality ends up being a tedious trek from one room to the next, where the only relief comes when you happen upon the portal out of the level.', ""Project Temporality is also hindered by technical shortcomings that range from repetitive environments to frustrating glitches. The frame rate is noticeably sluggish, a problem exacerbated by floaty mouse aiming. The game recycles objects and set pieces to the point where levels begin to look too similar to one another. You see many of the same signs, workstations, and stasis pods copied and pasted without restraint. Hallways especially feel repetitive after a while. I didn't even want to count how many times I passed the exact same sparking cables and splashes of grime."", ""Worst of all are collision glitches, which are evident through the entire game. Any object has the potential to lock you in place with some invisible barrier, or drop you into the floor while you flop about. Granted, you can reverse time by a second or so to remove yourself from the perilous grip of random couches or guardrails, but that's not the point. When you crash to a halt while your attention is locked on a countdown timer, it breaks the pacing. And when the culprit is a half-inch-high bump, it's maddening."", ""Project Temporality wears its influences on its shiny metal space sleeves. Its effort to imitate is tepid, however, and the stuff of its own concoction that fills the gaps isn't particularly good either. Without the constant glitches, the game would be a mediocre six-hour distraction allowing you to toy with an enjoyable time-bending mechanic. The shallow story and the general awkwardness of its delivery, not to mention Project Temporality's inability to lead the protagonist without a leash, however, prevent the game from being worth the time.""]"Carolyn Petit,29-May-14,Among the Sleep Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/among-the-sleep-review/1900-6415778/,7,PC,"[""In dreams, our minds sometimes try to find ways of coping with the things we can't quite process when we're awake, the things that are too sad, or too scary, or just too big for us to understand. Some of my earliest memories are of recurring nightmares in which I cowered from a terrifying monster. I didn't understand the monster; I just knew that it was something to be feared. Years later, I came to see the monster as a representation of the conflict and upheaval in my home, which I also wasn't capable of understanding as a child, and which also terrified me. Among the Sleep uses the fertile ground of a child's sleeping psyche as its setting, conjuring surreal landscapes that fuse the familiar and the unknown. The game's potent atmosphere makes your brief journey a worthwhile one, even if, in the end, the answers you find on your quest to help a toddler cope with some painful truths don't add up to as much as you'd hope."", ""The fact that you play as a toddler is Among the Sleep's most unusual characteristic, and also one of its best. This isn't just a first-person game in which the camera is lower to the ground than it would be if you were playing as an adult. When you walk, your steps feel unsteady; you can get around more quickly by crawling, but walking has its advantages. On foot, you can drag objects around, and you can open drawers, which you often need to clamber up onto in order to reach doorknobs or get to higher areas. By making you interact with the world in this teetering way from this perspective, Among the Sleep makes the fact that you play as a toddler not just a narrative conceit, but an integral part of your experience."", ""Among the Sleep doesn't start off in dreams. It begins in a brightly lit house on your unnamed character's second birthday. It's here that you receive Teddy, a birthday present who comes to life in your character's imagination and accompanies you on your journey. Teddy is a comforting presence, the light he shines when you hug him seemingly a metaphor for the way the support of a friend or the love of a parent can help us find our way through the scariest situations in life. And things are scary for your character, though the reasons why aren't immediately clear."", ""After being put to bed, you find yourself in a changed home, your mother missing. Your only hope of finding her is to venture through different realms to find four talismans that represent memories associated with her. Throughout some sections of your journey, you are hunted by a frightening monster. Still, your quest isn't challenging--environmental puzzles are never taxing, and it's easy to hide from the monster who occasionally stalks you, though its presence is still frightening for the way that it makes the air around you vibrate and for the staticky outbursts of distorted sound that emit from it like screams."", ""Most of the time, Among the Sleep is a creepy game rather than an outright scary one, and the sound design is crucial to the unsettling feeling the game generates. Knocks on wood, distant shrieks, discordant chimes, and other sounds lend a foreboding air to the game's strange and imaginative environments, which are quite creepy in their own right. Fittingly, these environments feel like something out of a dream, meshing toys, crayon drawings, and other elements of childhood with fragments of playgrounds, libraries, and other places rife with symbolic meaning. The fact that you're playing as a toddler makes the world around you feel threatening and unconquerable; whatever manifestations of evil might lurk in the fog that surrounds you, you'd be helpless against them."", ""But venturing into the unknown of each new realm is ultimately an empowering process--even as a child, you are capable of facing the terrifying unknown and coping with whatever you find there. Unfortunately, the abrupt ending that awaits you at the conclusion of your journey feels underdeveloped and disconnected from the rest of your journey. 2012's Papo & Yo was a very different game, but it similarly focused on a young person struggling to cope with a frightening reality, and whereas that game built up to a cathartic conclusion that emerged organically from everything that had come before, Among the Sleep's ending comes a bit out of the blue, and doesn't leave you feeling much of anything."", ""It's unfortunate that the game doesn't leverage its intriguing concept to tell a more memorable story and that its ending is underwhelming, but even if the destination leaves you wanting, the journey is far from wasted. Among the Sleep is a distinctive and promising first game from new Norwegian studio Krillbite, and though the dreams it conjures might be scary, it ultimately leaves you with the feeling that you're strong enough to face your fears, in dreams or otherwise.""]"Britton Peele,29-May-14,Where is My Heart?

On one end of the environment is your starting point, and at the other is your goal. Now, take that paper and cut it up into a bunch of smaller pieces, and then shuffle and rearrange them completely, leaving some gaps and creating some overlap between pieces. Can you still trace a path from the beginning of the paper to the end, moving as if the environment were still whole?', ""This is how you move around in Where Is My Heart, a game that's equal parts simple and disorienting. Move to the right, and you might find yourself in a panel to your left. Jump up, and you might land on the bottom left of the screen. It takes the very simple elements of moving and jumping and makes them far more interesting (and difficult) simply by shifting your perspective, and the result is a puzzle game that's not only unique, but also smart enough not to overstay its welcome."", ""Your goal in each mazelike mosaic of a stage is not to put the level back together, but rather to guide a family of three lost monsters through the pieces to the goal, collecting hearts along the way. You can switch between them with the tap of a button, which lets you take them into different directions or makes them work together to get past obstacles. (You might need, for instance, to stack them on top of each other.) This basic concept is tricky enough. Levels that would be very simple (not to mention very short) if properly arranged become labyrinths when mixed up like they are. But often, the mere ability to find what direction leads where isn't enough to reach your goal."", 'In their basic forms, each of these monsters is essentially the same. They all walk and jump at the same speed and same height, and have no special abilities. However, certain levels allow the monsters to evolve into special forms. The brown monster becomes a rabbit that can double jump. The black monster develops the ability to see an alternate landscape, with platforms where there previously were none or holes where there were once walls. The orange monster develops the trickiest (but also the coolest) skill: it can rotate the panels of the level around, which allows it to jump from one panel to another in ways that were previously impossible.', ""Every level in which some or all of these skills appear is carefully designed to take full advantage of them. Each monster's ability has a purpose, and only by working together do they all get home safely, whether that's done by activating switches unreachable by other monsters or temporarily splitting up and reconvening elsewhere in the stage."", ""If this sounds like it might hurt your brain, rest assured: it does. It's amazing how disorienting it can be to have your perspective messed with in this way, but it's equally amazing how much you can adapt. You quickly learn to carefully test your movement, stepping just barely out of one frame to try to see if you also show up in another, and you might find yourself frustrated, mentally shifting the mixed-up panels around, trying to make sense of them. There's a very good chance that you (like me) will have to resort to trial and error as you stumble through each stage, but that's ultimately OK. There's no penalty for making a mistake, save a trip back to the beginning of the stage for whichever monster met its untimely end. But with every leap you take that ends up on spikes or in a pool of water, you learn just a little bit about your surroundings."", ""It's amazing how disorienting it can be to have your perspective messed with in this way, but it's equally amazing how much you can adapt."", ""Where Is My Heart is a bite-size experience, lasting only a couple of hours (not counting bonus levels or the challenge of collecting every heart in every stage). This is to the game's benefit, though, because it ends just as the gimmick is growing tiresome. There are moments when it's more frustrating than fun--being lost, after all, is rarely a pleasant experience--but even then it's hard not to appreciate how far the developers have taken such a simple idea.

While there are too many pop culture references and too much comedic relief for the ""noir"" part of that label to stick, the general tone is one of grim expressionism, bolstered by some finely constructed action sequences. In fact, beyond its ham-fisted exposition and painfully slow start, there\'s little to hold the experience back from being one of the better action role-playing games in quite some time.', ""The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing II is absolutely massive and packed with secrets and details that are easy to miss the first time around. You wouldn't know that from the first few hours of play, though. Van Helsing is remarkable in that it has one of the most annoyingly intrusive introductions in recent memory, yet explains almost none of the subtlety this game has to offer. Van Helsing II opens in medias res, but what seems like a potentially exciting start comes off as cluttered and ultimately confusing. The game picks up right after the conclusion of the last game, and you play as the son of the infamous vampire hunter Abraham Van Helsing. After felling the mad scientist that had terrorized the fictitious, industrial-era city of Borgova, you take over a resistance movement against the corrupt government. Your initial motivations aren't made clear, and the entire opening sequence is dominated by cutscenes that have weirdly nauseating cameras that wobble around while the main characters discuss detailed military strategy."", ""It's all a bit overwhelming, which is particularly unfortunate given how great the game becomes. A few hours in, you have access to your secret lair, a subterranean hideout that serves as your base of operations for the rest of your adventure. From there, you can marshal troops, craft new equipment, and generally help guide the resistance movement. Again, why exactly the movement is necessary is never made clear. You never see the real effects of the allegedly corrupt government, and there's no reason to empathize with the populace. That said, all of these pieces come together remarkably well, combining the straight action RPG trappings of the first Van Helsing with added gameplay modes."", 'From here, Van Helsing II is loosely organized into a few discrete chapters. For each one, you have a primary objective that supports the resistance movement\'s plan to take the city of Borgova. These are tied directly to the game\'s gothic horror inspirations and help build up the intensely supernatural world. Without a gripping narrative to serve as the foundation for this adventure, the creatures and environments are left to carry the experience. Thankfully, the art direction is just as substantial as before, and is largely supported by these quests to unlock power held by long-dead beings. The main quests provide plenty of excuses to venture into the wilderness outside the city and play in a variety of striking locales. Each of these places is also home to a variety of Easter eggs, which help each environment feel dense and populated. Upon the conclusion of each chapter, you\'re shown a few stats detailing your time spent, the percentage of the secrets you managed to unearth, and how well you did overall. Once you\'ve seen the ""chapter complete"" screen, however, the preceding areas are lost to you for the rest of the game, encouraging you to be thorough in your search.', ""You don't have to deal with the big things immediately if you don't want to, though. Like before, there are plenty of supplementary quests for those looking for a break from the core game. The tower-defense minigame makes a return, with robust tools for managing waves and waves of baddies. You can also hire soldiers, upgrade their equipment, and build up a small army to run consistent raids for you. They can bring back valuable items and tons of extra cash, which you can reinvest in your war effort, or yourself. Various non-player characters also offer additional one-off quests that help further build out this surprisingly rich world, and yield some great loot for you and your companions. Finally, you also have some shops and crafting tools to help you get the best gear and tools for combat versus the weird, surreal, and undead monsters that roam the wilds outside of Borgova. That's great, because as you might expect from Van Helsing's action RPG scaffolding, combat is what this game does best."", 'Combat has improved dramatically since the last entry in the series, and that\'s primarily because of two small but vital changes. The first is that the two classes originally released as downloadable content for the first game are now packed in. From the beginning, you have three distinct archetypes, each with a dramatically different play style. The default hunter class is a melee-ranged fusion that harks back to Bram Stoker\'s original descriptions of the literary vampire hunter. The other two are a bit odd thematically because they represent two of the main types of enemies that you fight against: unholy magic users and engineers warped by ""weird science."" Even so, they add a lot of variety and are distinct enough to warrant spending at least a little time with each.', ""For my main run, I used an arcane mechanic. The class focuses on deploying robots, mines, turrets, grenades, and other corrupted machinery to dominate the battlefield. That's actually where I felt the second change to combat most: two additional skill slots. In the first Van Helsing, you played as a hunter that balanced ranged and close-combat weaponry using six main abilities. There was a clean duality to it that's retained for those who choose to take up being a hunter once again. I, however, found it much more exciting to constantly manage mines and robotic spiders to assist me in combat. I didn't invest much into boosting my health or defense, instead focusing on maximizing my attack-power-by-proxy. It added a bit of tension as well, knowing that if my machines started to fall, I'd need to rapidly get them back into action or face death. The extra skill slots made managing the chaos of battle more challenging but also more rewarding without teetering into the unnecessarily convoluted."", ""Van Helsing is coarsely granular. Some of its pieces don't work as well as they should, but much of that falls by the wayside when you're in the thick of things. It is stellar in spite of a few big missteps and the fact that, with the exception of the world itself, none of the experience feels cohesive. Between combat segments, Van Helsing and his ghostly companion, Lady Katarina, exchange snarky quips about pop culture and casual digs at one another. It's nice for characterization, but it's also anachronistic and fails to fit into the rest of the game. That's fine, though, because Van Helsing never takes itself too seriously. It's all part of the ride.""]"Kevin VanOrd,28-May-14,Air Control Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/air-control-review/1900-6415776/,1,PC,"[""Three ugly character models sit around a fire: an unblinking man in a suit with his arms locked at 20-degree angles from his body; a dwarf that stole Catwoman's mask; and a zombie with its fists clipped through a chair yanked from a tavern in World of Warcraft. These creatures seem like refugees from three different 90s-era games, but they're apparently the CEOs of airlines currently at war. Airlines that count doctors that strew entrails about their planes' cabins among their passengers."", ""How a developer would think to ask money for this travesty is unfathomable. The horrors begin with the main menu, where you discover that the mouse cursor and mouselook are simultaneously active, so that when you choose one of Air Control's modes, you also move the camera around. The background shot is of an underwater airplane, above which sits the game's title in a blurry font. That title doesn't sit in the interface, however. No--it simply sits above the aircraft as though the letters exist within the game's own world. Clearly, something's amiss, and if the main menu isn't enough to convince you, then the abominable zombie-human-dwarf cutscene that opens Casual Mode certainly should be."", 'The mess that follows is homely, unfinished, and inept. By default, an inexplicable array of buttons labeled ""lock cursor"" are strewn across the screen. You can remove them by clicking the ""disable [lockcursor] UI"" button at the top left, though that particular button needlessly remains in all its unsightliness. Remember: any cursor movement is accompanied by complementary mouselook, so interacting with the interface causes the camera to move wildly about. In this case, it\'s an airplane interior that dizzily rotates around you as you turn off the interface and guess at what your goal is. As it turns out, you\'re a flight attendant, and the big red sentient exclamation mark at the rear of the plane has a task for you: deliver some coffee to a passenger in the front.', ""Your next task is to pick pillows up from the floor, which means moving the mouse cursor over them and clicking them, a rather uncomfortable task if the mouse cursor has moved to the edge of the screen, as it just may have by this point. And so you point and click on the pillows, which simultaneously changes your point of view so that you're facing the passengers to the left. You might try to hit the escape key and try to restart the level, or abandon this rubbish altogether for a different mode, but doing so in any of the game's modes causes the mouselook and movement keys to stop functioning, and in some cases renders the level entirely inoperable."", 'Casual Mode plays out in a series of bizarre levels, most of them only a few seconds long, that have you moving from the back of the plane to the cockpit (yes, that\'s it), picking up a gun and shooting a terrorist, picking up trash bags, or performing some other mundane task. Every one of these activities is awful. Passengers sit in a catatonic state with their arms held stiffly in place. Terrorists don\'t move or animate in any way, and explode when they die. Sometimes there are weird colored cubes on the floor for no reason. In one ludicrous level, there\'s no gravity, and the game displays only a few frames per second. And every nonsensical task is accompanied by peculiar descriptions written in broken English. ""You need to find reason while airplane fell down"" says one dialogue window, right before you discover that ending the mission requires... opening a door. ""You can open your inventory with a button situated in left"" says another, even though there is no inventory button, on the left or anywhere, and the mission gives you no reason to have one.', 'You also get to be a mechanic, which means hovering over some buttons until one turns red and you click on it. More often, you get to be a pilot, both in Casual Mode and in Killjoy Mode, but piloting an aircraft in Air Control is a farce: the controls make no sense, the camera angles make no sense, and if you crash, you have to quit out of the game and restart it due to the aforementioned broken menu options. Crashing into the sea is particularly fascinating, as the water is actually a solid object; how the aircraft in the main menu managed to sink is a mystery.', 'You shouldn\'t forget Realistic Mode, in which you walk around in an airplane cabin filled with petrified character models while cursing the ridiculously low frame rate, and then do nothing because that\'s all you do in this mode. To be fair, though, doing nothing is preferable than wasting your time on this wreck, which advertises itself on Steam as ""the best flight simulation in the history of computer games"" and promises that it is ""the first airplane game, where plane compartment is visible."" Both of these claims are lies, of course, which only makes sense for a broken scam masquerading as a computer game.']"Heidi Kemps,27-May-14,Drakengard 3 Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/drakengard-3-review/1900-6415774/,7,PS3,"[""From a traditional perspective, Drakengard 3 is not what you would normally consider a good game. It's severely visually outclassed, it has myriad bugs and issues, and the gameplay is fair at best and tedious at worst. The original game, released a decade ago on the PlayStation 2, was much the same way. But what made that game memorable was its distinctly dark and twisted story in a world filled with horrible happenings and broken, deplorable characters. It was a train wreck, horrifying to look at and experience, but it kept you playing to see just how much more awful things could get. Nothing ended well for anyone involved, including the player, but it was fascinating regardless."", ""And that's precisely what Drakengard 3 is: utterly fascinating."", 'The game takes place in a miserable fantasy world where goddess-like beings called ""intoners"" rule the land and keep the masses appeased with their otherworldly songs. That peace is transformed into a bloody mess when the oldest of the intoners, Zero, decides that her five sisters (all named after numbers) need to die for reasons initially unclear. Zero\'s attack on her sisters ends in abject failure and the death of her dragon companion, but a year and a reconstructed body later, she is ready and rarin\' to kill her estranged siblings again. To aid her this time around, she has Mikhail, the reincarnation of her previous dragon, by her side. Unfortunately, a wise old elder dragon this creature is definitely not; Mikhail is an inept pacifist who calls for nonviolent resolution as he whines about his bodily functions like a first grader.', ""Drakengard 3 is a hack-and-slash action game. Zero runs through mostly linear fields, defeating foes with combos and special moves derived from four different weapon types (swords, spears, chakrams, and combat bracers). She can guard, dodge, and cancel her skills into defensive maneuvers as necessary. As she defeats foes, a flower-shaped blood meter fills up, and once it reaches a certain threshold, Zero can enter the incredibly powerful and near invincible intoner mode for a very limited time. Unlike in other games of this sort, the blood meter doesn't have to be full in order for you to enter intoner mode, though its level does limit the amount of time intoner mode lasts. This adds a bit of strategy to fighting--should you use intoner mode for short bursts of carnage, or save it for bigger, powerful foes?--but overall, nothing about combat is particularly noteworthy. It's certainly functional, and there's definitely a satisfaction to be had when going to town on a bunch of dimwitted soldiers and their giant monster companions, but it's a far cry from the likes of Bayonetta."", ""Every so often, however, Zero mounts her lovably stupid steed and uses Mikhail for combat. Mikhail's sequences are either Panzer Dragoon-style rail shooter sequences (though not nearly as well made as in that franchise) or free-roaming sequences where Mikhail can fight foes both in the air and on land. The controls in this mode take some getting used to, and many of these stages and arenas aren't ideal for large, bumbling winged reptiles to be battling in. Still, it's a welcome, if not always particularly well-designed, break from stabbing troops directly."", 'In fact, ""well-designed"" doesn\'t apply to most of Drakengard 3. The game is developed by Access Games, the studio behind the cult hit Deadly Premonition, and shades of that game\'s distinct clumsiness abound in Drakengard 3. Enemy models are frequently recycled, and, in some cases, they don\'t stand on uneven ground properly, leaving one, two, or even more feet just floating in midair. Textures are frequently so low-res that the game looks like a poor HD upscale of a PS2 version that never existed. Enemies and AI partners frequently get stuck trying to run past walls or off ledges. The combat camera appears to hate you and everything you stand for, going into bizarre angles and focusing on barriers to the action out of spite. The frame rate fluctuates constantly, sinking to single-digit levels if a bunch of projectile-hurling enemies are in the area. I encountered at least two occasions when the game forgot to reverse Zero\'s controls after shifting the camera 180 degrees.', ""Yes, Drakengard 3 is a technical mess. But, in a weird way, that's part of its charm. If you're familiar with the previous games of creator Yoko Taro--the original Drakengard and Nier--then you're probably coming in expecting messy gameplay. You're not here to kill a thousand grunts; you're here for a weird, fascinating, and much bigger experience. And, to that end, Drakengard 3 is amazing."", 'The driving force for everything in Drakengard 3 is the main character, Zero. Zero is a nasty, nasty woman, mocking everyone within sight and berating Mikhail for his childish naivete at every opportunity. Yet, in a strange way, she becomes incredibly sympathetic. Her voiced reactions to the ridiculous plot twists, outlandish characters, and irritating gaming cliches frequently mirrored my own. It felt as though I were reacting through her involuntarily to the horrifying happenings of this sick, sad world. I actually felt like I related to her as the game progressed, which is not something I typically feel for antihero characters.', ""Part of the reason Zero's anger didn't turn me off right away, though, was that every human in Drakengard 3 is a horrible person. Zero's sisters are selfish and domineering, with personality traits that are immediately off-putting. Their disciples, whom Zero can recruit as non-player character helpers after defeating them, aren't much better, individually representing the traits of sadism, masochism, sexual hedonism, and narcissism. Their dialogue with Zero throughout the levels, and their interactions with her, are frequently amusing and well written, even if the same jokes get recycled too often. (I commend the localization team for its ability to come up with numerous entertaining penis euphemisms.)"", 'The first playthrough of the game feels like a distinctly black parody of game story and design tropes, filled with awkward character interactions, bizarre non sequiturs, and a general disdain for everything Zero is forced to go through when all she really wants to do is kill her sisters and be done with it. There are odd little digs at things like Japanese character design, media censorship, and otaku culture. It concludes with a bizarre twist that seems disappointing at first, but shifts the story in an entirely different direction.', ""Much like Drakengard and Nier, this is a game where the multiple endings are a near essential part of the whole experience. The humor is played down as the game steers you along its alternate paths. On the way, it comments on game structure and the role of the player as both active participant and passive observer, and goes deeper into individual character backgrounds and relationships. It never stops feeling oppressive and unpleasant, but that's part of what makes it so interesting--so much so that when the game asks you to grind to get every weapon to open the path to the final ending (though, thankfully, not the downloadable weapons--that's too cruel even for Drakengard), you feel not just obligated to do it; you want to do it. It's laborious and unpleasant, and somehow Drakengard transforms it into something you willingly want to do all while knowing it probably won't be enjoyable in a typical gaming sense."", 'Drakengard 3 is subversive in that way. I love how it has made me think about violence and what exactly makes characters sympathetic even when they\'re terrible. I love that the game portrays its female characters as assertive beings that desire and need sex on their own terms, instead of as sexual material doled out in-game as ""rewards"" for player performance. (In fact, the only time Zero discusses sex with her disciples is to either tell them to shut up with their innuendo or berate them for their poor performance in the sack.) I love how the only voice of human sanity is a nonhuman. I love how I can step away and think about how the concepts introduced in the alternate ending paths symbolize abstract concepts of gaming. I love Drakengard 3, warts and all. In fact, I think the warts might be part of what makes the game so appealing. It\'s a heavily flawed game, set in an ugly world and filled with despicable people. And yet, somehow it\'s beautiful.']"Kevin VanOrd,27-May-14,The Wolf Among Us Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-wolf-among-us-episode-4-in-sheep-s-clothing-re/1900-6415773/,7,PC,"[""At the opening of the fourth episode of The Wolf Among Us, titled In Sheep's Clothing, the pieces of a silver bullet remain lodged in Bigby Wolf's arm. The shards come out, and Bigby's bones slip back into their proper positions, but not without some pain--pain on the part of the snarling victim, and pain on the part of the cringing player. It's not an easy scene to watch, but watch you must as you help Bigby connect the two halves of his snapped radial bone."", 'While the third episode led to a final scene of great drama, In Sheep\'s Clothing begins with gut-wrenching tension and then relaxes. Given this strenuous opening, it\'s nice to have time to take a breath in the scene that follows, though the air is as thick with smoke as it always is when Bigby is near. In fact, Bigby\'s obsessive tobacco habit becomes a subtle story point, with several characters remarking on his cheap taste in cigarettes, and Bigby choosing whether or not to ignore a no-smoking sign. My favorite moment of the episode came when one of the four choices I was given was simply ""smoke,"" and the scene ended with the loud snap of the sheriff\'s lighter. I am not sure if the frequent smoking references foreshadow events to come, but they are certainly effective at setting the proper noir tone, and acknowledging Bigby\'s deepening frustration.', 'It\'s no wonder that Bigby\'s frustrated: Colin tells him that it takes monsters to fight monsters, while another Fable insists that he play the game by the book. Nevertheless, whether you follow the monstrous path or the diplomatic one, you make some vital discoveries that shine light on past events as well as on the Fables that surround you. Beauty and Beast in particular come into sharper focus, in part because they are clearly living beyond their means. ""You know what they say: with centuries of marriage come centuries of baggage,"" says Beast, creating a new adage on the spot. That baggage apparently involves pretending you still live in an opulent castle. Some Fables cannot let go of the past, only to discover that holding onto the past limits the future.', 'This scene goes on for a bit too long, but it at least it demonstrates the couple\'s rising desperation. Another scene focuses on a butcher\'s desperation, and it, too goes on for too long, and without much of an emotional payoff. The episode designates him as a stand-in for the ""everyfable,"" as it were, but it\'s difficult to get invested in the plight of the average fable when its representative snivels almost as much as Ichabod Crane did. I grew impatient during these scenes. An early meeting in Bigby\'s office made my heart heavy by drawing thematic ties to the original episode\'s gruesome murder; these later scenes imparted information without building tension, causing them to feel inert by comparison.', ""That inertness, in turn, made it easier to notice a number of distracting hiccups: interrupted voiceovers that halted in unnatural ways, animations that didn't flow very well into the next, and a plot point involving a monkey and a mirror that is never sufficiently explained and stands out as an obvious delay tactic. Fortunately, In Sheep's Clothing allows you to momentarily forget the minor blips and unsheathe your claws in a confrontation that might have you bonding with an unlikely ally. I adored this moment not just for its gruesome and impactful imagery, but for how I was able to form it into a finale of its own. I shared a cigarette with a fellow fable and then said goodbye. It was a moving bookend to a troubled relationship, and I was glad I had the chance to mend a few cracks, though not an entire fence."", ""I left the third episode of The Wolf Among Us with my heart in my stomach; I left the fourth with burning curiosity, which is not as striking of a feeling. But given what other fables tell me of the Crooked Man, I suspect that it will not just be my curiosity that burns in the final chapter of this episodic tale. I want closure, I crave closure, but The Wolf Among Us has taught me that conclusions aren't always neat and tidy, and that you must suffer pain before you can earn relief.""]"Kevin VanOrd,27-May-14,Watch Dogs Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/watch-dogs-review/1900-6415770/,8,Xbox One & PS4,"[""If Watch Dogs is to be believed, then a shocking number of Chicago residents are delinquents. As you roam the city looking to both right what is wrong and make wrong what is right, you hack into its citizens' smartphones and listen in on their conversations, and even tap into their computers and catch a glimpse of them as they enjoy their deviations in the supposed privacy of their own homes. Some of these Chicagoans are chronic masturbators; others are criminals and cannibals, ordinary to look at should you pass them on the street, but far from ordinary when they think they are alone."", ""Aiden Pearce is also far from ordinary, but he understands that privacy is a myth. The city has installed a computer system called ctOS that knows everything, sees everything, and controls everything. Aiden is a hacker. By manipulating ctOS's systems, Aiden can steal from your bank account, gain access to surveillance cameras, and even discover your profession and learn where you went on vacation, or whether you're faithful to your spouse. Aiden's nefarious talents are valuable, and he once had no qualms about who he killed or robbed, as long as he delivered the information and earned his reward."", ""You'd suppose, then, that information is your most powerful tool in Watch Dogs, but this open-world game's joys come not from voyeurism and information brokerage but from chaos and destruction. Combat encounters are structured like puzzles: Aiden hunkers down and you survey the area, choosing whether to dominate your enemies with firearms and grenades, press against cover and distract your enemies so that you can pass by without raising their suspicions, or settle on a compromise, silencing enemies with well-aimed headshots and taking them down from behind with a swift takedown maneuver. But whichever style best suits the occasion or your mood, you're likely to cause a few explosions and toy with your enemies' heads."", ""How do you create such chaos? By overloading circuit boards, setting off guards' grenades remotely, or forcing pipes to burst beneath your foes' feet. Such control, right at your fingertips; thanks ctOS! When I felt particularly evil, I threw a distraction lure toward a circuit board and detonated the board as a nearby guard approached. He cried out in agony, and I was grateful that I had one less obstacle between me and my destination. But this kind of evil could feel even more heinous if I happened to glance at my victim's personal information before annihilating him. Oh--he was recently married. Or perhaps he was on antipsychotic medication. Occasionally, I would hesitate to put a bullet in a guard's head if I knew his wife was expecting a child, but I rarely had reservations about murdering a prison escapee. I was deciding whose life had greater value, and I'm grateful that Watch Dogs, in its own subtle way, led me to ponder why I would prize one man over another. With one snap moral judgment, I might decide to let one man live and another die. Unless, of course, I was under fire from every direction, in which case all bets were off."", 'I don\'t wish to overstate Watch Dogs\' social musings, however. The game sometimes pauses to grapple with quandaries about the trade-off between freedom and security in modern society, but rarely reaches any conclusions or digs very deeply. This is a game that allows you to hack into highway billboards and reveal age-old memes like ""I can has cheezburger?"" This is a game in which you eavesdrop on a man who couldn\'t ejaculate during a sexual encounter because his bladder was full. Such drastic tonal shifts prevent the story\'s early attempts at gravitas from sticking, leaving Aiden looking like a chump with little self-awareness, and leaving the player to wonder what really drives this vigilante, apart from the revenge quest that has him seeking to retaliate against unknown persons for the death of his niece. When his sister, Nicky, pleads with him to stop his pursuit, explaining that he\'s risking the safety of his remaining family, Aiden makes a promise he doesn\'t ultimately keep. Why he is so willing to seek vengeance while knowing he\'s putting his sister and nephew in peril is never sufficiently explored. Perhaps Aiden is addicted to the underground life he has come to lead, which has him staring at his smartphone\'s screen in the same way that I so often do, oblivious to what\'s happening around me.', 'I came to be more invested in the story once I\'d assembled a small team of hackers and closed in on the conspiracy at the game\'s center. Watch Dogs\' tale is at its best when it sticks to its Tom Clancy-style technospeak and leaves behind the revenge-story cliches that seem to power every tale about a man dealing with his anger over a female loved one. My devotion was not to Aiden, however, but to his friends Clara and T-Bone. One character describes Clara as a ""punk-rock chick,"" but she\'s not so remarkable for her tattoos and knee-high boots as she is for her empathy toward Aiden and her patience for his stubbornness. And if Clara\'s type is punk-rock chick, then T-Bone is the Southern-fried genius, a down-home intellect who thankfully keeps the Hee Haw language to a minimum.', ""Aiden eventually matures, albeit too little and too late, and wonders aloud who should get to choose whose lives are less important than others. Shortly thereafter, that question still lingering, you decide if Aiden should be that person. By that point, it was clear to me what he must do, based on audio logs I'd found scattered across the city. I was glad I'd taken the time to learn what I did; finding those logs isn't required to finish the story, after all. And I was glad that Aiden at last was asking the same question I had many hours beforehand: Does the loss of one life justify mowing down dozens or hundreds of men, and risking my own sister's life in the process? If only he had pondered such obvious concerns hours before, I may have been more concerned about his ultimate fate."", ""Watch Dogs' narrative may win no awards, but as an open-world playground, the game rightfully deserves to be mentioned with heavyweights like Grand Theft Auto and Saints Row. This playground isn't just loaded with stuff to do, as most such games are; it's loaded with lots of terrific stuff to do. I lost myself for an hour solving chess puzzles. Other times, I shot up aliens in several of Watch Dogs' augmented reality games. And still other times, I would locate remnants of QR codes painted on walls and overpasses, and hack from one camera to the next, looking for the angle that would let me view the entire code. Even the smallest activities are fully engaging. Not only are the chess puzzles clever, but I listened to two women converse about job woes as I solved them, which gave me an additional dose of entertainment. The alien shoot-'em-ups occur on Chicago's busy streets, where I got to witness car-crash victims gesticulate in anger at each other while I fired my holographic gun at virtual aliens. And like several of Watch Dogs' core activities, lining up QR codes kept my brain cells buzzing as I experimented with cameras and moved to different positions, hoping to merge those painted patterns into a cohesive barcode."", 'Some of these Chicagoans are chronic masturbators; others are criminals and cannibals, ordinary to look at should you pass them on the street, but far from ordinary when they think they are alone.', ""Moving from one activity to the next often involves summoning a vehicle to a nearby location, or simply nabbing one from the roadside or carjacking an innocent driver as she pulls up to a traffic light. Those drivers will not be happy--in fact, they may even call 911 and summon the cops--but it's worth getting on the po-po's bad side if it means racing through the streets in Watch Dogs' sizable collection of automobiles, or zooming through the canals in a speedboat if you happen to be near the water. Vehicles are rather bouncy, but the loose physics make for ecstatic moments, particularly during chases. As you speed along, you can trigger steam pipes beneath the streets to erupt and take down your foes, or cause jams by hacking into traffic lights. My favorite method of escape, however, was to raise a drawbridge as I approached it. I would fly up the first span, soar through the air, and land with a satisfying jounce on the other side; my pursuers would be left behind, blocked from entry. I could practically imagine the coppers throwing their caps on the pavement and cursing my keen driving abilities."", ""My favorite moments behind the wheel were those I shared online with competitors. Watch Dogs' single-player missions and multiplayer activities are merged into one experience, and the game frequently and annoyingly nags you with opportunities to engage with others should you not seek those activities for yourself. It's almost always worth accepting those offers, however, particularly should you be invited to an online race, or even better, invited into a decryption match."", ""Both modes are excellent ways to wreak havoc in the windy city. Online races offer plenty of ways to mess with your competitors. If you're trailing behind the leader and you approach a lowered blockade, raise it with the press of a button: your opponent bangs into it and snarls under her breath, and you cackle and rush into the lead. If you're crossing said blockade when another player raises it, you might bounce into the air and land on top of another racer. Should you activate the blockade too soon, you might end up obstructing your own vehicle with only yourself to blame. Open gates and close them behind you to throw off a tail, or hack a traffic signal and get him stuck in a jam. There are enough shortcuts, however, that there's no reason you can't gain ground after finding yourself on the wrong end of a blockade."", ""Decryption mode, in which two teams of four are confined to a portion of the city and seek to nab and hold on to sensitive data, is anarchy in its most captivating form. There are a few details that separate this mode from its capture-the-flag cousin, the most important of which is that you only have to remain within the data carrier's proximity for a certain amount of time to steal the data. This allows data to be passed around even when you are in vehicles, or without necessarily directly engaging a carrier hiding on a rooftop above. At one point, I rammed head-on into a carrier riding a motorcycle, and I watched his body fly above my windshield before it soared out of view and landed with a thud behind me. A teammate then leapt into my vehicle's passenger seat, and we zoomed away while my comrade fired his rifle at a pursuing ambulance. The action is constant--and constantly on the move--and the shooting is as sturdy as you'd expect in any given third-person shooter. Whether you're dealing death by shotgun or by cement truck, it's difficult not to be swept up in the pandemonium, cheering or groaning with each unexpected development."", ' ', ""Online invasions are less explosive than other modes, and potentially more boring, depending on how the invasion goes. As the invader, you come close to your target, press a button to begin downloading her data, and wait. As the victim, you rush around or hack into nearby cameras, scanning the crowd for your invader. (You always see yourself as Aiden, but other players see you as a random Chicagoan.) Neither running around looking for your hacker nor avoiding her watchful eye is engaging on its own. But catching the data thief initiates a chase sequence that leads to Watch Dogs' special brand of pandemonium. Rolling over a sprinting invader with an ice cream truck is one kind of delight. My favorite experience in an invasion thus far, however, was leaping into the bed of my hacker's pickup truck as he drove off, planting an explosive, and detonating the explosive as I leapt to the ground. It wasn't a moment I planned--the stars simply aligned, giving me the chance to pull off a dramatic kill. Successfully completing an invasion earns you a currency called notoriety, but earning the skills related to notoriety is so easy that there's more reward in the chase than in the subterfuge."", ""You can simply ignore all these possibilities and remain a lone vigilante, of course, and doing so offers its own kinds of rewards. Infiltrating gang hideouts is much like performing many of the story missions: you search for a way into the danger zone and decide how best to proceed. The wonder of Watch Dogs is that any method is reasonable--and every method is enjoyable. The weak link is the shooting, not because the mechanics aren't great (they are), but because enemies are so quick to go limp--and even more so when you activate the game's unnecessary bullet time. But if, like me, you seek to express some creativity in your encounters, you'll enjoy piecing together a stealthy route and performing a hushed assassination when it proves necessary."", 'Decryption mode, in which two teams of four are confined to a portion of the city and seek to nab and hold on to sensitive data, is anarchy in its most captivating form.', 'Watch Dogs isn\'t a full-fledged stealth game in the usual sense; you can\'t hide bodies or tranquilize mafiosos. However, slinking from cover to cover is smooth and weighty, as if Aiden is Sam Fisher\'s bulkier cousin. I came to rely on a move I call ""riding the cameras,"" hacking into one camera so that I might in turn hack into another until I was able to tag all of my enemies and devise ways of thinning the herd. Riding the cameras is also the primary way you hack into ctOS centers, each of which presents an environmental puzzle to solve so that you might reveal more hot spots on your map. Many of these puzzles are quite clever, though some story missions take the camera mechanics a few steps further, particularly a prison level in which you hack into guards\' personal cameras and investigate from their perspectives.', ""One type of optional mission--the digital trip--deserves special mention. There are four digital trips in all, each one an expansive minigame explained away as an audio-induced hallucination. One of the trips is a fun bit of frippery in which you bounce from one giant flower to the next, remaining in the air as long as possible. The other three, however, could be fleshed out into full games in their own right, which is a testament to how good Watch Dogs' individual pieces are. In the best of these, you gain control of a humongous spider-bot, battering police cars and leaping up the sides of buildings from which you fire rockets at helicopters and pellet the authorities with machine-gun bullets. Games that have focused on wall-climbing have rarely made these acrobatics feel so intuitive, and I'd gladly see the spider-bot find its way into a game fully devoted to it. The other two digital trips--a stealth sequence in which robots seek you out, and a car combat game in which the highways are lousy with zombies--are almost as delightful, and all of them have their own skill progression trees. The trips are structurally simple, but their foundations are rock-solid and rich with possibilities."", 'Watch Dogs does a lovely job of keeping its many interlocking systems from becoming overwhelming, though some systems ultimately feel superfluous. You can buy different outfits, but they all hew to the same basic style; you can buy new vehicles for ordering on demand, but fast cars are perfectly easy to find. As a result, the economy is never as meaningful as it might have been; apart from a sniper rifle and silenced pistol I purchased from an ammo shop, I rarely went shopping, simply because I rarely needed to. Even hacking scores of random passersby begins to feel excessive: when you have access to everything, no one person or piece of information is special anymore. Precious little of that information is actually a gateway to a human soul.', ""Aiden's soul is still locked away, too, even though I spent dozens of hours with him. But while I can't say who Aiden truly is, I can confidently say that Watch Dogs is a lushly produced and riotous game with an uncanny ability to push you from one task to the next, each of which is just as fun as the last. This version of Chicago is crawling with a hyperbolic number of degenerates, and I didn't mind squashing pyromaniacs and slavers under my tires as I plowed through the streets chasing after a hacker, hip-hop beats blasting from the radio. After all, the struggling mothers and homeless beggars wandering Chicago deserve some peace of mind, and doling out some street justice is a good first step.""]"Tom Mc Shea,26-May-14,Monochroma Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/monochroma-review/1900-6415772/,4,PC,"['The term ""corporate overlord"" is usually used in jest. We recognize how much power these inhuman entities have over us, but we\'ve yet to reach the point where our waking hours are dictated by their whims. In Monochroma, we see a vision of a city in which this term has reached its terrifying potential. The fear of losing your freedom is palpable, communicated through the emptiness of the cityscape, the bleakness of the visual design, and the unceasing rain washing away any semblance of hope. It\'s unfortunate, then, that the plight of one boy striving to break free of this citywide prison--filled with puzzling barriers--is overshadowed by something as mundane as technical failings. Monochroma conjures frustration instead of empathy, undermining the intriguing premise set in the early going.', ""There are no words in Monochroma, no dialogue to explain what has happened to your home. Rather, the story is told through 2D imagery, so questions are left dangling in the air, and you must decide what caused such unrest. During the early hours, I scoured the backdrop looking for pieces to explain what had happened. There are robots stationed in people's homes. Though originally intended as consumer companions, they may have risen in revolt as robots so often do. But I found no such violence when I encountered one. So I could only wonder why the people had left, or if they had been killed by the corporation performing experiments in their factories. Who knows the answer? As the game progressed, my interest waned as supernatural elements were introduced. What was once a gripping allegory of our own society became a fantastical leap to something I couldn't relate to."", ""Monochroma's emotional weight should come from the relationship between the young protagonist and his helpless brother. You must carry your sibling on your back, braving the many obstacles that stand before you both as you search for freedom. Normally, such a partnership would have captured my heart, as evidenced by Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons. But there's a logical problem here that only caused me to question what was going on. In the very beginning, you see your younger brother flying a kite, running freely through wheat fields. However, he ceases to use his legs after the first few minutes, which just made me wonder why he had become such a useless lug. Having to carry him adds to the puzzle dynamic, because your movement is restricted by his weight, and you can only put him down in spotlights, but that added consideration feels forced. Why couldn't he help me?"", 'Monochroma conjures frustration instead of empathy, undermining the intriguing premise set in the early going.', 'I wasn\'t bothered by my brother\'s ineptitude at first. Nor was I hung up on the clumsy controls. Sure, climbing up boxes took longer than I expected, and I often had to retry jumps because my character wouldn\'t respond quickly enough, but I was so taken in by the enticing premise and stark visual design that such issues seemed minor. I even marveled at how clever certain situations were. Though I could only push boxes, pull switches, and perform a modest leap, the puzzles offered plenty of diversity, forcing me to take time to formulate a plan. Figuring out that I could quench the flame erupting from a barrel by pushing it into the rain gave me a satisfying ""Eureka!"" moment, as did clearing a difficult jump by catching a rope midswing. This was a world I wanted to exist in, and the action was good enough to warrant that investment.', ""Things began to change as I got deeper into the adventure. The controls became such a hindrance that I would be stuck on puzzles long after I knew what to do, only because I couldn't get my character to respond. In one section, I had to push a box before the rising water swallowed me alive. The box had to be in an exact place or my character wouldn't be able to grab it, yet the finicky controls didn't allow for such precision. While the two boys were riding atop the box as the water rose, the box would shift awkwardly, defying expected physics, often tossing them into the deep without giving me a chance to react. In a maddening boss sequence, the collision detection was so off that I would die when his strike was far from my body. And the sluggish movement meant I couldn't accurately dodge his attacks even when they were blatantly telegraphed."", ""Even when you do coax your character to perform his rightful duties, Monochroma is never satisfying. Instead, you feel relief that you were allowed to move onward, knowing how tricky it would be to replicate your success. But shoddy controls aren't Monochroma's only issue. The game struggles to properly communicate what's going on. In one puzzle, I had to move a flaming barrel through a rain storm. It appeared that I had to use pallets moving along a conveyor belt as a roof, but I could clearly see rain falling across the entire screen--even beneath that shelter--so I had no idea if my plan was at fault or if it was my execution that was lacking."", ""And then there are the small problems that ensure you're continually hounded throughout the journey. Monochroma has abrupt loading screens between sections that break the flow of the action, and has sound issues where music fails to play. Knowing how far you can safely fall is a crapshoot; I would often perish even when I plummeted only a modest distance. When you die, your character falls stiffly to the ground, in an almost comedic pratfall. Death is even sillier when it involves your brother. In one puzzle, I mistakenly dropped a barge on his head a dozen or so times, and there was no impact, no ceremony, so I never felt any sadness at what I had done. There were so many times that I groaned from annoyance or laughed from amusement that I couldn't stay invested in the boy's struggles. It's a shame how often Monochroma undermines its own strengths through technical problems."", ""Monochroma is a game that I wanted to enjoy, and I thought it would be worthwhile even halfway through the adventure. But things really go off the rails as you push onward, with most of the later puzzles demanding precision that's just not possible. Even though the artistic design is eye-catching, and the music deftly builds on the feeling of oppression, there are too many problems heaping frustration upon you. The youthful protagonist of Monochroma is incredibly brave and filled with awe-inspiring love and patience, but all of those good characteristics are overshadowed by his insane clumsiness and the problematic world he exists in.""]"Maxwell McGee,22-May-14,Tropico 5 Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tropico-5-review/1900-6415769/,8,PC,"[""Everything is just one big joke on the island of Tropico. Your research team is incompetent, your diplomat is a snob, and your radio DJ is absolutely shameless. But that's OK, because both Tropico 5 and its digital inhabitants don't take anything too seriously. This management sim wraps its irreverent wit around some easily approachable mechanics that smartly grow in complexity as you move through the ages and become more familiar with your new role as El Presidente."", ""I'm getting ahead of myself, since you're not actually El Presidente in the beginning. Instead, Tropico 5 starts you off as a lowly governor in the Victorian era under the service of the Crown. From these humble beginnings, you must guide your people through World War II, the Cold War, and beyond. Each age brings with it a new set of challenges because your tiny island nation is sandwiched between the world's rotating superpowers. But as your trusted advisors say, it is your will alone that is holding Tropico together, and that means doing anything and everything necessary to stay in office, whether it's rigging the next election or putting down civilian riots. After all, you're doing this for the good of the people, and your Swiss bank account."", ""Throughout the ages, your advisors take excellent care of making sure Tropico 5 is easy to pick up and enjoy, whether you're familiar with this series' long history or not. You start in the Victorian era, where Lord Oaksworth, emissary to the Crown, guides you through building your first resource-gathering structures. These assignments are always couched in some harebrained scheme the king has cooked up back home, such as requesting that you build a logging camp so the king can complete his underwater palace."", ""These missions to build certain structures or complete certain tasks continue throughout the game, and as you grow and define the style of your nation, they can be accepted or ignored as needed. In the beginning, you're just trying to stay in the black and keep your people happy, but as you advance through the eras, you may wish to shape your island into a high-end tourist trap or become the world's leading producer of cigars and rum. The types of missions selected for you are different each time you play and together they try to shape your island towards a certain style, but the game is also flexible enough for you to strike your own path as well."", ""However, each mission carries with it some sort of political consequence. Usually it's a trade-off between appeasing one faction on the island and angering another, such as siding with the Crown over the revolutionaries, or later the Axis supporters over the Allied supporters. You don't have to please all of the people all of the time; you just have to stay in power. Forever. Virtually every choice you make--from the buildings you build to the people you trade with--has some sort of impact on your standing with the island's various factions. Molding popular opinion to your advantage is an enjoyable and ever-changing challenge that grows in complexity as you move through the ages and more factions are introduced."", ""But while this game's simple mission design is there to reel you in, it's Tropico 5's sense of humor that baits the hook. From the wording of your island's constitution to the musings of your radio DJ, this game's irreverent streak touches every aspect of the island. And in its own way, this devil-may-care attitude is fitting for Tropico 5 since the game isn't concerned with breaking down every little bit of minutia for you. It gives you just enough information to make an informed decision without leaving you lost in a maze of submenus."", ""Consider your budget. In Tropico 5, you're not earning money at a constant rate; rather, it comes in large lump sums when your trade ships arrive at port. And when you have that huge influx of cash burning a hole in your pocket, it's hard not to blow it all right away on new structures and other island improvements. Your citizens will love you for it, but you'll also be putting yourself back in crippling debt. Now, were I an egocentric island dictator in this goofy parody of real life, then I, too, would likely spend beyond my means when the time was ripe and then sweat it out during the off-season. Tropico 5 is full of little design touches--like how your money is doled out--that help reinforce its fiction that you are, frankly, a buffoon."", ""There is a lot to enjoy on the sandy beaches of Tropico 5. Whether you're playing alone or with up to three others online, the game strikes a good balance between style and substance that is easy to digest for all types of strategy fans. The constant power struggle between the game's various factions--both internal and abroad--creates an ever-changing challenge for you to manage as El Presidente, whether through force or appeasement. And while the rest of the world tears itself apart with World War-this and Cold War-that, the simple-minded Tropicans are there to kick their feet up and take it easy for all us sinners.""]"Daniel Starkey,21-May-14,Warlock 2: The Exiled Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/warlock-2-review/1900-6415768/,7,PC,"[""It was sometime around the 13th straight hour of playing Warlock 2 that I realized I probably should have been asleep a few hundred turns ago. Despite that realization, I couldn't quit playing. Warlock 2 is a classic 4X strategy game that focuses a bit more on the combat and exploration side of things, and it works stunningly well for the most part. Warlock 2 starts with a novel premise--warfare split across multiple dimensions--and executes that vision with an inspired artistic flair, some unorthodox design choices, and a haunting, emergent narrative."", 'Before each match in Warlock, you pick your ""great mage,"" a grand and nigh omnipotent leader to help guide your forces and vie for power with others of your kind. You research world-rending spells, gather your forces, and wage war on a transdimensional stage. Play, for the most part, revolves around slowly making your way across different planes of existence. These are radically different dimensions, with some being pits of demons and hellfire and others so imbued with the energy of life that simply being there heals your soldiers over time. Strange dimensions were a big feature in the first Warlock game as well, but this time around, they\'ve moved from being an ancillary novelty to the focus of play.', ""The dimensions are linked by a haphazard network of portals. These act as choke points, much like Sins of a Solar Empire's phase lanes. Until the very late game, most of the strategy revolves around controlling as many of these portals as possible. As a given match progresses and your burgeoning empire begins to stretch across several of these planes, maintaining efficient troop movement and matching your empire's upkeep costs can become overwhelming. Around eight hours into my first match, I was struggling to maintain a decent flow of cash to support my armies. I was forced to take a hard look at each of my bases and nix the unnecessary ones. Simply destroying them can cause quite a bit of unrest in your citizenry; instead, you're encouraged to convert them to either massive forts or temples for your favored deity."", ""There are eight major gods you can follow, and each correlates with a broad class of forces: life vs. death, earth vs. wind, fire vs. water, and so on. Earning the attention of gods can be accomplished only by building temples and shrines in their honor, and doing so can give you access to some of the best spells in the game. In the main research path for spells, you only ever have two healing spells, and by the late game, those start losing their utility. I chose as my deity the god of life, and had quite a few options for keeping my troops in proper fighting condition. Toward the end of the game, my patronage had started to annoy some of the other gods, and I saw the living avatar of the god of death descend from the heavens to kill me. I didn't have the armies to repel him, and I was close enough to satisfying another victory condition that I just let him destroy some of my older bases. With that, though, I began to notice an underlying theme in Warlock 2--the idea of balance and order."", ""The first Warlock had you seeking to attain the highest power in the land. Following those events, one omnipotent being controls all of creation and has torn it apart to maintain his position as the United One, a title that's about as ironic as they come. After finishing my first campaign match, I saw a terse clip confirming my interpretation. Gods seek your favor, but should any one gain too much power over any other, they descend to correct the imbalance themselves. Everyone naturally seeks power and hopes to expand and conquer in this world, but after a point, that becomes problematic."", ""Powerful spells that can reshape vast swaths of land help buttress the central theme of the game, namely that as a great mage, you are one step removed from a god--a power that you probably shouldn't have. Each type of land has its own effects, and these move beyond the standard defense and movement bonuses. While I was invading the plane of death, I noticed that this unholy land was steadily killing my holy warriors. I steadily reworked the land and filled it with life-giving hills and flatlands. While it was nice to have that ability, it seemed fundamentally wrong. I was twisting and contorting the world to suit my own designs, but, as far as the basic setting goes, that's exactly how the world became so broken in the first place."", ""Sometimes the land-changing spells can be a bit too powerful, and it's far easier to destroy than it is to create. If an opponent simply scorches your plains to reduce farm output, your farms themselves aren't destroyed. They just become less efficient. If your farms or any other buildings are sunk entirely, however, you need a spell to fix the land and then rebuild all of your damaged structures. If another mage strikes the proper city with one of these spells, that can stall a military campaign or kill your ability to maintain units. The results are not too far removed from the role of nuclear weapons in other strategy games, but these spells can be cast very cheaply and cannot easily be blocked without constantly running counter spells. In multiplayer especially, it can often become a contest to see who forgets to block whom first, and that can get tedious quickly. Ostensibly, powerful spells are intended to be balanced by the fact that you can't cast where you can't see, but building up a small cadre of scouts to keep large chunks of the map visible at all times is hardly difficult."", 'Because the focus is on such small groups, distinctive visual design helps reinforce the idea that each piece of your army is special. Ships, lords, and even foot soldiers are remarkably well designed.', ""Even with a few scouts on hand, armies in Warlock are noticeably smaller than in most strategy games. At my strongest, I was fielding a force of maybe 20 units, and typically running about 10. With unit upgrades and the very limited movement speed of units, games focus more on managing small teams of powerful, well-trained soldiers than massive fodder armies. You also have the ability to keep up to four lords, which, depending on their level and upgrades, can easily overwhelm just about anything. That's for the best, because it avoids one of the biggest problems of games like Civilization. With the exception of the awkward pacing issues I mentioned earlier, games progress evenly and don't bog down with hundreds of soldiers in the late game. Managing their equipment and buffs is also much easier and more straightforward than it really should be given how many potential boosts you can give to any one unit."", ""Because the focus is on such small groups, distinctive visual design helps reinforce the idea that each piece of your army is special. Ships, lords, and even foot soldiers are remarkably well designed. Even with the basic troops, there's plenty of variety and flair to their visual presentation. Subtle graphical effects, such as the continually twisting rays of light that hover over holy, life-giving plains, make the overworld visually busy, but in such a way that helps the entire game feel more cohesive and solidly constructed. The user interface is similarly intricate, and all of these pieces work together to help sell this rendition of the standard fantasy setting."", 'That level of detail sometimes clashes with the lackluster execution of some of Warlock\'s better ideas. The potential for political interaction between the disparate factions is limited. With the exception of the undead\'s weakness to all things holy and life-giving, there\'s not a whole lot to make each faction feel distinct in terms of play. And when it\'s time to sit down at the negotiating table with other leaders, your choices can be summarized by ""Give me stuff"" and ""I\'ll kill you.""', ""Warlock was a creative game that tried a few interesting new things--namely the global spells and extra dimensional planes--and Warlock 2 takes them all a step further. Making the multiple dimensions a priority instead of a side bit refocuses play toward direct combat and exploration. The small army sizes prevent floods of units from taking and holding all points on the map and necessitate greater care with movement and empire expansion. Together, this creates a slow but focused style of play that's unlike anything else on the market.""]"Carolyn Petit,20-May-14,Transistor Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/transistor-review/1900-6415763/,8,PS4 & PC,"['A dead man.

You\'re still in one piece; that\'s all that matters.""', ""Transistor begins with remarkable confidence, throwing you right into the life of nightclub singer Red at what might be her lowest point. There's no immediate explanation for who she is, or what this world is, or what happened the night before, and all this mystery only makes your journey more captivating. Transistor asks you to trust in it, to come along on the journey even though you have no idea where you're going. And it rewards your trust, weaving a beautiful and unconventional sci-fi tale with a human heart, and empowering you with a wonderfully flexible combat system that fuses real-time and turn-based action to create something that feels unique."", ""As you move through Cloudbank, the world of Transistor, you encounter manifestations of the process, a force that's seemingly running rampant, annihilating Cloudbank as it goes. With the help of the transistor--the strange weapon you pull from a dead man's body when the game begins, a weapon Red drags along behind her as if it's a sword that's too heavy for her to wield properly--you fight the process. You can run around fighting your enemies in real time, but you're outnumbered, and you're just not quick enough or strong enough to overcome them this way. Thankfully, you have a trick up your sleeve called turn, which enables you to freeze time, plot out your upcoming movements and attacks, and then carry them out in rapid succession."", 'As you progress, you collect more and more techniques, called functions, each one the essence of a fallen resident of Cloudbank. There are 16 functions in all, including straightforward attacks, movement abilities, a function that spawns a doglike helper, a function that temporarily turns enemies into allies, and others. Each one can be slotted as an active ability, or to upgrade another function, or to give you a passive benefit. There are a remarkable variety of ways in which these techniques can be combined, and hitting on particularly effective combinations and putting them to use in battle is immensely satisfying.', ""Transistor's combat makes you feel powerful by giving you an edge on the process, but it also encourages you to think carefully about what you're doing, because the process is no pushover. It has tricks of its own, sometimes obscuring your vision, sometimes pulling you out of your turning phase without warning. It's a clever foe, which makes matching wits with it all the more enjoyable. And, much like the idols of Supergiant Games' earlier game Bastion, Transistor has limiters, optional modifiers that make your life more difficult but reward you with more experience, so if you want a more challenging experience, you can have it."", ""But what is the process, really? And what has happened to all the residents of Cloudbank? Red is driven to get to the bottom of it, and she's not alone. From inside the transistor speaks a man's voice, bringing life to your quest as it responds to your actions and slowly helps you piece together the story of Cloudbank. The always-present voice also puts a relationship at the heart of Transistor. Red can't speak--the events of the night before have stripped her of her voice--but her wordless actions reveal her fierce determination, and as the voice speaks from the transistor, and Red finds ways of responding to it, a connection between the two becomes clear."", ""There's a touch of magic, even of spirituality, to Transistor's story, a sense that there are things within the world of Cloudbank that transcend our understanding of what's possible."", ""Also shedding light on the world and its people are the files accompanying each function. To reveal more about these people whose essence has been trapped in the transistor, you have to use their functions in different ways, putting them in active slots, upgrade slots, and passive slots, which gives you an incentive to tweak your build and try different techniques. The files are so well written and paint such vivid pictures of Cloudbank's fallen residents that you naturally want to uncover all the details they contain."", ""What slowly emerges in Transistor is the story of a clandestine organization called the Camerata, working behind the scenes in Cloudbank for its own purposes. And while the answers to the plot's questions about who the Camerata are and what the transistor does are interesting, they're not what makes Transistor's story special. Cloudbank is a technological world, but not a cold one. It's not a place of pure ones and zeroes. There's a touch of magic, even of spirituality, to Transistor's story, a sense that there are things within the world of Cloudbank that transcend our understanding of what's possible."", ""And Transistor's artful presentation has some magic of its own. There are a few astounding moments in Transistor, like the moment when you step up to a microphone and press a button to sing, and Red's haunting voice comes in and carries you back to what had happened the night before, the visuals communicating in shorthand what words would take too much time to say. Or the moment when Red, silhouetted against the city, speeds across Cloudbank on a motorcycle, hunting the people who are responsible for everything that has happened."", ""Transistor is always a good-looking game, but in these instances, it demonstrates a rare knack for combining its visuals and music to powerfully convey both narrative information and tone, driving the story forward with Red's own unwavering resolve. So in the end, yes, Transistor is a fun action role-playing game with a neat combat system, but beautiful moments like these make it more than that. They make it a game with a soul.""]"Cameron Woolsey,20-May-14,Minecraft Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/minecraft-playstation-3-edition-review/1900-6415767/,8,PS3,"[' ', ""Minecraft is a sandbox game like no other. Over the years and across many different platforms, it has proven time and time again that with a spark of imagination and a reliable pickaxe, anything is possible.

Since its digital release last December, Minecraft: PlayStation 3 Edition has made strides to catch up to the original PC version, introducing new materials, biomes, and villager trading. While you still can't yet create stained glass or ride horses across a grassy plain, the crux of what makes Minecraft such an absorbing and satisfying experience is right here--though the tightly constrained world may leave you disappointed."", ' ', ""At a glance, Minecraft on the PlayStation 3 is nearly identical to its Xbox 360 brethren. In terms of controls, neither version one-ups the other. When 4J Studios ported the game to the Xbox 360 in 2012, it paired the version with sharp, fluid controls. The company has shown the same love toward the PlayStation 3. It takes minutes to get attuned to Minecraft on the DualShock controller, and soon you find yourself punching trees with the best of them. With time, you craft the necessary tools required to tackle twisting mines and dense jungle terrain as you collect precious resources while fighting off temperamental creepers and spider jockeys. Once you get into the swing of things (typically in the form of a sword or pickaxe), it's doubtful the thought of needing a mouse and keyboard to master Minecraft's untamed wilds will ever cross your mind."", ""Also making the transition is the simplified crafting system, which streamlines the building experience. In the crafting menu, you're free to scroll through and examine every item that you can build under the square sun. Items you can craft right away are fully colored; otherwise, they are slightly opaque. This system replaces the more trial-and-error crafting found in the PC version of Minecraft, where you must manually place resources such as iron ingots or stacks of lumber on the three-by-three grid of a crafting table to create an item. If you're coming from the computer version of the game and feel that experimenting with resource placement is an important part of the Minecraft experience, this toned-down style of crafting may not impress you. However, if you're more concerned with jumping into the game and creating the items and structure pieces you want quickly and without having to scour dozens of how-to guides, you will find the more accessible crafting system a blessing."", ' ', ""Much like a cave, the crafting in Minecraft is deep and initially daunting, but the game's passive tip system designed for new players is the torch that lights the way through.

Thankfully, Minecraft eases you into its expansive world slowly via tooltips that offer hints as you play, offering detailed glimpses into materials, tools, and other assets.

Teasing the edge of the map rewards you with an invisible wall, and attempting an escape via wooden boat causes your seafaring vessel to despawn, leaving you to humbly swim back to shore. The PC version also sports sharper, cleaner details and a greater view distance.

Once-beautiful cities like Berlin and London have been transformed into oppressive urban landscapes. Propaganda posters are plastered over miles of depressing concrete, while loudspeakers echo the doctrine of the Nazis\' totalitarian regime and the punishments that follow for breaking it. The streets are patrolled by technological terrors--Nazi mechs and robotic guard dogs, whose imposing grey forms against the drab grey concrete are broken only by the deep red of Nazi banners. This is the world of Wolfenstein: The New Order, a world where resistance seems futile. But there is one man who is up to the task: William ""BJ"" Blazkowicz--the same Blazkowicz who escaped Castle Wolfenstein, shot a lot of Nazis, and took down Mecha Hitler in 1992\'s Wolfenstein 3D.', ""But what is Wolfenstein's place today? The series spawned the first-person shooter genre, but like The New Order's alternate-history setting itself, times have changed. Can a Wolfenstein game in 2014 marry the bombastic action and narrative drive of today's shooters with the series' own simple pleasure of shooting Nazis in the face? With this fresh and interesting setting, powerful and satisfying weapons, and a new, robotics-focused take on the Nazi war machine, developer MachineGames, formed by ex-Starbreeze veterans, has figured out how to answer these questions."", ""The first few hours of The New Order take place in 1946. Despite the Fuhrer's demise, the Allies are losing. Blazkowicz spearheads a last-ditch assault on the new, heavily fortified headquarters of the Third Reich. The operation goes awry, and Blazkowicz takes a piece of shrapnel in the head. He spends the next 14 years in a vegetative state, recovering in a Polish mental institution."", 'The Blazkowicz that emerges into this strange new world is still the same Blazkowicz of Wolfenstein 3D: a blunt instrument.', 'This isn\'t just a convenient plot device to bring the majority of the game\'s action into the Nazi-controlled world of 1960. You see, the Blazkowicz that emerges into this strange new world is still the same Blazkowicz of Wolfenstein 3D: a blunt instrument. He isn\'t tormented by a dark past like BioShock Infinite\'s Booker DeWitt; he does not suffer a deep-seated sense of loss like The Last Of Us\' Joel; and he has no trouble reconciling his nature as a killing machine like Spec Ops: The Line\'s Martin Walker. He is a man who, as a side character excitedly exclaims, ""was born to kill Nazis."" Though Blazkowicz emerges from his vegetative state fully functional, he still doesn\'t know how to view the world unless it\'s down the twin barrels of assault rifles akimbo. If a switch needs a gentle press, Blazkowicz punches it. If a door needs opening, Blazkowicz kicks it down. For as much as The New Order\'s plot is about Blazkowicz rebelling against the Nazis\' iron grip on the entire planet, it\'s also about the friction created when the original first-person shooter protagonist drops into a first-person shooter designed for 2014.', '""Nazis dead. Nazi robot dead. Broke all your shit. Helicopter secured.""', 'As Blazkowicz escapes the institution and contacts the resistance, its members give him highly technical objectives--patch this module into the control tower so we can hijack this helicopter--as he stares back at them, dumbfounded. Blazkowicz\'s inner monologue upon completing such an objective offers cogent insight into his thought process: ""Nazis dead. Nazi robot dead. Broke all your shit. Helicopter secured."" Friendly side characters describe him as ""ape-like"" and ""the crazy American."" A Nazi who attempts to subdue Blazkowicz with what he describes as ""enough tranquiliser to put an elephant to sleep"" exclaims in shock, ""There must be something wrong with your cerebral cortex,"" as Blazkowicz simply walks it off.', ""But there is nothing wrong with Blazkowicz's brain. He simply says and does things a shooter protagonist from 1992 would say and do were complete motion capture and voice acting available at the time--most of which is shooting Nazis. Blazkowicz is positioned as a lens through which you see how the nature of first-person shooters has changed since his first appearance. Tonally, the result is an overarching sense that the world has left Blazkowicz, and his intentional lack of nuance, behind."", ""In combat, Blazkowicz even functions like a 1992 shooter protagonist--he needs health and armour pickups to stay alive, and he can carry all of his guns at the same time. This immediately allows for a wider range of options in any particular combat situation than a shooter with a weapon carry limit would offer. Those guns are big, loud, and satisfying to shoot. Most weapons can be dual-wielded, which works well because you don't lose any accuracy by not aiming down the sights, a tweak that lends the combat a sense of finesse despite its fast pace. Individual enemy AI isn't particularly complex, but it works in the context of this kind of shooter. Instead, larger enemies like Nazi robots add variety to combat through their increased threat and the fact that different tactics are required to take them down, such as using Tesla grenades to stun them, or shooting off specific pieces of armour. All the while the combat feedback is dialled to 11, with effects like near-comedic squelching sounds as stick grenades shatter Nazis into tiny giblets."", ""There is enough variety in the combat spaces, and the enemy combinations within, that The New Order's levels feel well paced, and combat feels tense without being unmanageable or overwhelming."", ""Levels flow back and forth between tight corridors and wide, open arenas. A lunar museum sees Blazkowicz running through backstage passageways and around large, spacious exhibits. A level set on a massive, destroyed bridge requires Blazkowicz to squeeze through train carriages precariously dangling over the edge, whilst crossing back and forth over the larger, open structure of the bridge itself. Though enemy numbers never reach those of the Doom or Serious Sam-like hordes, there is enough variety in the combat spaces, and the enemy combinations within, that The New Order's levels feel well paced, and combat feels tense without being unmanageable or overwhelming."", 'Some rudimentary yet functional stealth mechanics allow The New Order to craft entire levels where Blazkowicz is armed with nothing but a knife. These are interesting because they add variety to the game\'s pacing, providing quiet, tense moments in which you are required to pay attention to enemy patrols and lines of sight, but which don\'t end in a ""game over"" screen if you get spotted. Nazi commanders, who can call in reinforcements if they detect you, create a hierarchy of high-value targets in a single room. When those commanders are present, the interface shows your distance to them, but not their exact location. It\'s rewarding to feel like you\'re stealthily stalking them, taking them out silently, and then are free to pull out the big guns to clear an area in the most efficient manner possible. With these mechanics, along with some interesting mission locations and stellar environmental design, The New Order offers a wide variety of combat experiences.', ""In an effort to further allow for play style personalisation, a perks system lets Blazkowicz gradually unlock both stealth and combat abilities. However, the tasks required to unlock individual perks--such as stealth-killing a certain number of Nazis--are mostly actions that you perform naturally over the course of the game. Combine that with the fact that the majority of the perks themselves have only subtle effects, such as slightly extra ammo, and you'd be forgiven for forgetting the system exists at all. Outside of the perks system, weapon upgrades can be found throughout the game's levels and permanently attached to your guns. Assault rifles can be upgraded to fire underslung rockets, and shotguns can be made to fire shells that bounce off walls, effectively turning them into Unreal Tournament's flak cannon. The upgrades are useful, opening up new avenues for tactical approaches to taking down the tougher Nazi foes."", ""The New Order also requires Blazkowicz to make regular use of a laser cutter. It is both a weapon and a utility that can manipulate the environment. However, its use is mostly relegated to cutting Blazkowicz-sized holes in the only pieces of metal grating that are blocking forward progress in the first place. There are a few panels which hide secret areas containing health and ammo pickups, but although you can cut any shape you like, unless it's a square you won't fit through it."", 'The game is both a celebration of the Wolfenstein series and what feels like a fitting send-off for it.', 'Both the laser cutter and the perks system feel like missed opportunities at worst, because even aside from them, The New Order\'s combat intensity and variety have granted the Wolfenstein series a breath of fresh air, whilst still managing to hit the nostalgic highs that I expect from the series. It has injected some substance into the primal pleasure of shooting Nazis by way of an interesting tone that addresses the changing roles of first-person shooter protagonists. Through this, the game is both a celebration of the Wolfenstein series and what feels like a fitting send-off for it. The New Order could be the last hurrah of William ""BJ"" Blazkowicz, an outing which, for all its excess and bombast, is far from mindless.

Memento Mori 2: Guardians of Immortality tries to be. It tries to tell a Da Vinci Code-esque story of murder and intrigue with clues hidden in artwork and a quasi-religious journey spanning several countries. Sadly, Memento Mori 2: Guardians of Immortality is a below-average adventure plagued by bad localization from its original European release.', ""You primarily play as two recently married characters, Lara and Max, with the majority of time spent controlling the former. Lara is a detective who specializes in art-related crime, while her husband, Max, who's an artist, is mostly tagging along because they're on vacation together. What begins as a simple art theft investigation (because that's the best way for newlyweds to spend time together away from home) evolves into an increasingly convoluted tale of conspiracy, murder, and spirituality."", 'It\'s a standard point-and-click adventure in just about every way. Click on places you want to go, things you want to look at, or items you want to use. Some items can be carried in your inventory, often with no satisfying explanation of why (""Oh look, fresh asphalt! Don\'t mind if just stick some of that in my pocket for later""). Items can also be examined close up, and occasionally they can be combined, which helps you solve a variety of puzzles with often unconventional solutions. All in all, it\'s really just par for the course for the genre, which isn\'t inherently a bad thing, though it\'s certainly unoriginal.', 'Memento Mori 2: Guardians of Immortality is a below-average adventure plagued by bad localization from its original European release.', 'The real issue is that Memento Mori 2 is cobbled together from subpar pieces, a fact made worse by poor localization in terms of both translation and voice acting. Character models might look OK when standing still, but every animation looks stilted and unnatural. The dialogue and overall story range from uninteresting to bad, and many awkward phrases betray the fact that their writers are not native English speakers.', ""And that's to say nothing of various bugs and errors, including one particularly troublesome issue where certain characters sometimes say the wrong line at the wrong time. The subtitle will be correct, but the audio is completely out of place, and may accidentally give away dialogue that is supposed to be uttered later. A slightly less jarring but still awkward issue is that many lines sound as if they aren't said by their actual actors, but rather by stand-ins trying (and failing) to imitate them. One line is delivered by the actor you're used to, and then the voice is different for the very next sentence before switching back again. Even basic audio mixing is a problem; characters on the other end of phone calls are practically inaudible."", ""In concept, though, Memento Mori 2 aims high, and there are brief moments when there seems to be an unpolished gem somewhere under the dirt of bad animation and voice work. During the globe-trotting plot, you are occasionally faced with choices that feel as if they might have interesting and important repercussions--but they don't. Sure, your ending might change slightly if you decide to hand over a resignation letter, and a scene where you can (if you choose to) hide certain pieces of evidence almost succeeds in adding tension to the situation, but for the most part, these choices feel more like missed opportunities than meaningful actions."", 'That might be OK if more than a handful of puzzles in the game were interesting. Sadly, many of Memento Mori 2\'s puzzles are good only on paper. For example, a relatively early puzzle has you dusting for and then comparing fingerprints, an action that is reasonable in the context of the story\'s investigation (though the character analyzing this evidence has no reason to know this skill) and can require a certain level of thought to execute. In practice, however, holding fingerprint samples side by side is less exciting than your everyday ""spot the difference"" style of puzzle. Furthermore, the common adventure game frustration of being stuck purely because you didn\'t spot the tiny item or clue on a single screen is here in full effect, though it\'s alleviated somewhat by the ability to highlight clickable objects with a button press.', ""But even that pales in comparison to the many actions you perform that are just plain boring. At one point in the game, you need to print some photos. But oh no, that darn printer is giving an error message. It's a paper jam, so you should open it up to fix that problem. Just find the switch to open the cover. But wait! You need to remove the toner first. You can't just pull the toner cartridge out, so find the switch that releases it. There, OK, now you can remove the paper jam and print what you need to print--after you put the toner back, obviously. It's all the tedium of an office job without the exhilaration of a paycheck."", ""Toward the end, Memento Mori 2's plot almost gets interesting. After hours of the game's own protagonist complaining that none of the plot details make sense, the game promises to explain everything and tie it all together after you stop a killer and maybe save the world or something. But that explanation isn't at all satisfying, leaving you with nothing to show from a rather boring expedition around the globe. If this is what immortality is about, then you have to wonder why anyone would bother to guard it in the first place.""]"John Robertson,29-Jan-14,Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 Full Burst Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/naruto-shippuden-ultimate-ninja-storm-3-full-burst/1900-6415648/,5,PS3,"[""There's a lot to be said for fan service and its role in entertainment. Providing material that speaks directly to an audience with a specific love and appreciation of a given source provides a palpable sense of private-club-like inclusion, allowing fans to feel connected through their shared interest whether they're in the same room or on the other side of the world. Rather than feel isolated and frustrated by an undying love for a given movie, character, comic, or novel, the existence of indulgence-orientated products makes us feel part of something bigger--there are people out there who like this stuff as much as I do. The Ultimate Ninja series has always taken this idea to heart, concentrating its focus to a laser point that other franchises would never dare to attempt for fear of alienating all but the most dedicated of followers. If you're part of the club, then such single-mindedness is great. If you're not, then don't let the door hit you on the way out."", ""Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 Full Burst is perhaps the most extreme example yet of Namco Bandai's attempt to appeal to the converted and only to the converted. Here's a game not simply for any old Naruto fan, but for Naruto fans who are completely up to date with the story and characters as they currently exist in the anime/manga episodes and are seeking a new way of experiencing previously explored plotlines. If you're not up to date, then not only are you going to struggle enormously with the story as depicted in the game's early stages, but you're going to ruin what you've not yet seen of the TV series. Unfortunately, due to gameplay that is as unwieldy and bloated as its title, Full Burst is not an acceptable way to get yourself up to date with this franchise."", ""This may be a beat-'em-up, but the primary Ultimate Adventure mode features so little gameplay in comparison to cutscenes and dialogue-heavy exposition that you'd be forgiven for thinking you're sitting through a barely interactive (albeit combat-heavy) soap opera. It feels as though developer CyberConnect2's plan was to create a condensed edition of the anime in which fight scenes are playable, rather than create a game in its own right. This leads to an experience that features such haphazard and irregular pacing that your principal cause for intrigue rests in trying to work out just how long it's going to be before the game asks you to pick up the controller again--and even when you do, the core combat is a shallow, button mashing affair that requires little in the way of skill. While there's definite and worthwhile value in repackaging the events of a beloved series in a new format, there's also value in a game giving you something to do."", ""There may be a lack of interaction in story mode, but that doesn't hold true for the package as a whole. Including all of the downloadable content released for the original Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja 3 release, the volume of content on offer is gargantuan. Chief among the additions is the extra Ultimate Adventure chapter, which sees Sasuke and Itachi Uchiha take on the nefarious Sage Kabuto, a segment that is so phenomenally difficult in comparison to the rest of the game that all previously learned tactics become essentially redundant. The same Sage Kabuto is unlockable as a playable character if you have the patience to jump through the numerous hoops to unlock him, and there are also some new costumes to swoon over."", 'The biggest, but certainly not most interesting, piece of extra content comes in the form of supplementary challenge missions. One hundred of these have you beating an opponent in a fight while handicapped in some way--removing your ability to jump, for example, or setting a limit on the number of attacks at your disposal. While these missions do add some welcome variety to the combat, they primarily serve to highlight just how shallow the core mechanics are. Without these externally shoehorned twists on battle, fighting suffers from an overwhelming shallowness that sees you engage autopilot once the basics become second nature. Only during set-piece boss battles are you asked to do something out of the ordinary.', ""To compound matters, the most members of the enormous character roster plays in the same way. You swap between characters regularly during Ultimate Adventure, but this is done predominantly to facilitate the narrative rather than to spice up gameplay through variety and diversity. Granted, significant and impressive visual flair is achieved by switching often between characters with attacks that are literally out of this world, but that aesthetic quality doesn't remain interesting long enough for the combat inadequacies to be forgiven. Clearly, this is not a game with the remotest desire to cement its place in the bastion of hardcore fighting game legacy, but that doesn't excuse the fact that there's so little meat to the gameplay that you're essentially feasting on elaborately painted bones."", ""Similar problems exist with Ultimate Adventure's role-playing-game-lite elements, which allow you to roam around a number of different environments with a view to collecting and buying items to use in combat (health potions, strength buffs, and so on) and optionally talking to loitering non-player characters. At times, these moments provide a welcome break from the cutscene/fight/cutscene pattern, but more often than not, they feel designed to artificially lengthen the game and trick you into thinking you're playing something with genuine genre-blending aspirations."", ""The closest comparison to this format is Asura's Wrath, another of CyberConnect2's offerings. However, where Asura's Wrath succeeds in this style of storytelling thanks to its short length and ferocious pace, Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 suffers from attempting to cover far too much ground for the core mechanics to handle. If you do classify yourself as a Naruto aficionado, then simply having another medium through which to consume the narrative is potentially going to be enough to satisfy you. Without a doubt, everyone else should look elsewhere.""]"Nathan Meunier,28-Jan-14,Insurgency Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/insurgency-review/1900-6415649/,7,PC,"['Another military online shooter? Don\'t groan and roll your eyes just yet. Despite being a stand-alone update on a seven-year-old Half-Life 2 mod, Insurgency\'s freshness runs deeper than its familiar urban warfare settings and ""good guys vs. the terrorist infidels"" trappings might suggest. This first-person multiplayer killfest pushes cooperative team play in interesting directions, using hyperrealism and a unique team role structure to drive its frenetic team-based firefights. Granted, it\'s not the slickest-looking shooter, but the dated look of these battlefields melts away as the intense tactical encounters heat up.', ""Like being shot in real life, it takes only a bullet or two to end your life in Insurgency. This makes getting dropped as you sneak out from cover or dart across an alleyway a jarring experience. Without any sort of map or radar system beyond your current objectives, you never know when you'll be caught in the crosshairs, or whether those bullets will come from the enemy or a trigger-happy comrade who mistook you for one. That alone doesn't make Insurgency's 16-on-16 team matches particularly unique, but the way this welcome realism extends throughout and enhances other aspects of its design certainly does."", ""Minimal use of HUD elements enhances the excellent tension threaded throughout each match and makes it easier to get sucked into the flow of battle. There's no health meter. No crosshairs for aiming other than your equipped scope or iron sights. No frilly nonsense clogging up the screen. No hand-holding. Resurgence forces you to pay close attention to what's happening around you. Without scouting, proceeding cautiously, and gauging the proximity and direction of nearby gunshots, you're pretty much guaranteed to wind up as toast. The exciting sense of danger this instills is tangible as you move through each map's tangled network of choke points and open areas."", ""Direct shootouts are a thrill in their own right when you've got a large mass of opposing squad members pressure-cooking an objective zone or a pinned-down group working together to escape alive. Outside of these heavyweight encounters, it's rare that you get to see your attacker until it's too late--at least when you set off on your own. By the time you hear the pow-pow-pow of gunfire and catch a quick flash in your peripheral field of view, you're on the ground bleeding out. Racking up kills requires great skill, and thoughtful teamwork often plays a critical role in how long you stay alive."", 'This first-person multiplayer killfest pushes cooperative team play in interesting directions.', ""Insurgency's cool squad system is well designed to nudge you toward team cohesion without making it mandatory. You can go lone wolf and try to tackle objectives on your own, but working with your comrades is a far easier way to stay alive and push your squad across the victory line. It's also a lot more fun way to play that way, too. From the many numerous matches I dove into, I found that the online player community is far more engaged and communicative about combat tactics than in some other similar-themed shooters."", 'Plenty of classes offer distinct loadouts and roles to choose, ranging from assault and heavy support forces to snipers and demolitionists. The twist here is that there are a limited number of slots on a given squad for each class, and everything is on a first-come, first-served basis. You can use limited supply points to customize your class loadout with a few different guns, weapon upgrades, and secondary gear, but these upgrades stick within the wheelhouse of each class type.', ""Team makeup specifics change depending on the map you're playing and the side you're on, but everyone has a role to play. For example, you might find yourself to be one of the only two snipers in your group or a soldier who has smoke grenades or a particular type of explosive needed to complete a mission. This encourages each team member to step in line or face the wrath of your squadmates. It's not just about playing your part, though; your team can't persevere if everyone is dead."", ""Most of Insurgency's game modes use permadeath as incentive to play super strategically and minimize the run-and-gun mentality of other shooters. In tactical operations, like Firefight and Search & Destroy, dying once kicks you into a spectator slot. You're stuck on the sidelines until your squad captures an objective zone, which allows you and your dead comrades to respawn as reinforcements. It's another neat wrinkle--one that makes matches feel fresh and entertaining but can also bog down the fun when you're just itching to shoot things. Sustained combat matches, like Skirmish, Strike, and Push, loosen the reins on this mechanic a bit, giving you more ways to earn reinforcements and stay in the action. Not every game mode is readily available on a consistent basis, however, if only because there are not a lot of players gravitating toward certain matches. VIP escort missions and the cooperative humans vs. swarms of AI mode are hard to hop into as a result."", ""Insurgency's cool squad system is well designed to nudge you toward team cohesion without making it mandatory."", ""A dozen different Middle Eastern map locales let you fight it out everywhere, from abandoned cities with tight alleyways and lots of structures to open forested mountaintops and snowy villages. Each area is well designed and full of nooks and crannies to use to your tactical advantage, and a handful of nighttime maps also add some nice variety. While the scenery and characters get the job done, they're nowhere as crisp, detailed, or stylized as those in other recent shooters. It can be an initial turnoff if you're used to more visually appealing offerings on the PC, but delving beneath the surface reveals Insurgency's strong team-driven focus and realistic gameplay to be the real gems here."", ""Intense tactical encounters filled with firefights and flying bodies prove thrilling enough to make it easy to look beyond Insurgency's less impressive visual design. The team dynamic and unique squad system inject something different into the mix too, offering match after match of absorbing cooperative killing that proves good looks aren't everything.""]"Tom Mc Shea,27-Jan-14,Tomb Raider Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tomb-raider-definitive-edition-review/1900-6415647/,8,Xbox One & PS4,"[""Examining ancient relics is just one small aspect of an archeologist's job. Sure, in-depth knowledge of deceased civilizations is important, but much less so than mastery of a deadly bow or a knack for a quick recovery after a bloody fight. Excitement defines the actions of an adventurous archeologist, no matter how reluctant you might be to bear arms, and you see this chaotic lifestyle through the eyes of perpetual survivor Lara Croft. Her life is one of bloodshed and misery, strength peppered with pain, and as she overcomes every crushing setback, she learns what kind of person she truly is. Such endeavors are so fantastical that her story of emotional growth is often overshadowed by the wildly unrealistic events, but the overwhelming beauty of the island is so gripping, and the exploration so expertly designed, that you become invested in Lara Croft's incredible journey."", 'The Definitive Edition of Tomb Raider is a lot like Lara Croft\'s excellent adventure from last year, only with enhanced visuals and extra features. Just about all of the downloadable content from the 2013 release is now located right on the disc. There are a host of new multiplayer maps to gun down your friends (or enemies) in, weapons pulled straight from Hitman: Absolution, and a handful of new characters to play as. Single player hasn\'t been ignored, either. One new tomb lets you flex your puzzle-solving muscle, and a variety of outfits give you more stylistic flexibility. Have you ever wanted Lara to dress like a 1930s explorer? Now\'s your chance! None of these additions are all that interesting, so if you\'ve already played through Tomb Raider on an older console, there\'s little incentive to jump in again. Unless, that is, you love voice communication. Both the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions support commands, so just saying ""map"" or ""pistol"" immediately does what you\'d expect. It\'s not the most novel functionality, but at least it works.', ""Lara Croft is a junior member of a small crew searching for the remains of a lost kingdom that mysteriously vanished. Her companions encompass typical archetypes that are at once recognizable and forgettable. There's the scientifically minded man who wears glasses and shirts with geeky puns, the muscled fisherman who defies his impressive physique by repeatedly showing just how sensitive he is, and a stoic mercenary who's also a long-term mentor to Lara. Their names don't matter, because with such little development of their personalities, you quickly forget who they were as soon as they're offscreen. This tired cast is thrust into a story filled with equally tired tropes, so you rarely care about the overarching events."", ""It's unfortunate how poor so much of the exposition is, because Lara herself is well defined. She starts out as a strong-headed recent graduate determined to scout unexplored lands in search of this lost civilization, but quickly realizes the terrible predicament she's in when things go awry. You understand her unwillingness to believe the terrible events that have transpired, and feel as squeamish as she does when she's forced to kill an attacker. Killing eventually becomes commonplace for Lara, and though it's hard to accept how quickly she adjusts to this bloody lifestyle, her anxious cries during battle and exhausted collapses afterward make you see the scared person hiding beneath the surface. And when she finally cracks halfway through the adventure, shifting from someone fighting to defend herself to a person clearly on the offensive, you understand that, too, because everyone has a breaking point."", ""Her shift from wide-eyed adventurer to full-fledged killer makes sense, and that's precisely why it's so uncomfortable. We're forced to put ourselves in her shoes, question how we would respond to attacks on our lives, and wonder if we'd be able to fight when it would be so much easier to surrender. Smart pacing ensures that there is plenty of time to examine what transpired in that last deadly fight. With only a half dozen or so attackers, most battles are over before you get lulled into a rhythm that demands you turn off your moral leanings. So you scavenge for a while, explore the environments, and then face five minutes of chaos and screaming before you're once again left by yourself. Such deliberate and rare steps into bloodshed make every fight so much more effective and emotionally taxing. As smartly as Tomb Raider handles its rare forays into combat, it does a poor job of showing death. Lara is tortured in such sensational ways that it's downright gratuitous, as if the game is reveling in her torment."", ""The overwhelming beauty of the island is so gripping, and the exploration so expertly designed, that you become invested in Lara Croft's incredible journey."", ""Thankfully, you can avoid such glorification if you want. Just don't die! Though that's often easier said than done. The early moments of Tomb Raider, and many other sections sprinkled throughout the adventure, are composed of quick-time events in which one mistimed button press leads to an immediate end. Often, these brief sequences are a welcome change of pace. When you're ambushed on a narrow bridge, or are running away from an avalanche, your heart races, and these sequences end quickly enough so that you don't get weighed down by your lack of input. However, by cramming so many QTEs in the first 10 minutes, the game makes you wade through tedious encounters before everything opens up. It's a shame that the early sections are so dry, because the rest of Lara's trip is full of excitement, but it's a small price to pay for the graphical brilliance these sections carry with them."", ""From the opening moments, Tomb Raider showcases its gorgeous visual design. Yes, the Definitive Edition sports better textures, lighting, and a variety of other technical effects than its PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 counterparts, but it's the art style that makes you want to venture deeper into this haunted island. As Lara picks her way through a claustrophobic cave, or hunts deer in a forest bursting with life, you feel as if you're a part of this world. Summit a mountain and then look toward the horizon; the delicate light streaming through the clouds creates a sense of romantic wonder that would please any couple on their honeymoon. This is a stunning game that shows how technical expertise can enhance artistic brilliance, and vice versa, as just about every element draws you ever more into Lara's world. The odd hiccups, such as flames that defy reality, stand out amid the well-realized look that seeps into just about every other element."", 'And you have plenty of time to admire the view. Lara travels through many different sections of the expansive map, and almost every one is a small-scale open environment. Hidden goodies are sprinkled throughout; some add details to the backstory, and others let you examine ancient treasures. Though none of them have much of a tangible impact, the sheer joy of uncovering their hiding places is endlessly satisfying. Tools that you gain throughout the adventure open up more pieces of the environment, letting you pull down structures with a rope arrow, blast through doors with a shotgun, and overcome other roadblocks as well. This encourages you to revisit sections to ferret out every lost doodad, and I spent hours just trampling through the environment in search of condor nests and flags.', ""There are optional tombs to plunder as well. It's strange that a game titled Tomb Raider places so little emphasis on, well, raiding, but the bite-size side quests certainly add a nice puzzle-solving element. Tombs hide elaborate mechanical structures that need to be appropriately manipulated in order to make your way through them. You may have to balance a platform with weighted barrels or use the power of wind just right, and there's a thrilling rush when you figure out what needs to be done. Granted, many of these areas contain only one or two puzzles, so you may spend only five or so minutes in one before you find the treasure at the end. But even though they're brief, they provide a nice detour that urges you to use your cunning along with your various abilities to discover every secret."", 'Such deliberate and rare steps into bloodshed make every fight so much more effective and emotionally taxing.', ""Eventually, you have to pull your attention from burial masks to the armed men attacking you. Lara has a vulnerability that leads to a quick end if you get hit more than a couple of times, so combat is built on smart movement and steely precision in the face of danger. By standing near chest-high barriers, Lara automatically crouches safely out of harm's way, though don't expect to stand your ground as your killers swarm toward you. With Molotov cocktails and well-positioned shots, attackers make you pay for standing still, so you must be as fast on your feet as you are with your trigger finger. Roll from one pillar to the next, or climb up to higher ground to relish a brief moment of respite. Enemies pursue you, leaving themselves exposed as they try to mimic your motions, and it's satisfying to loose an arrow or pick them off with a pistol as they stumble clumsily behind you. There are some silly moments, such as when you merely wait for a dumb guy to stick his head out from cover, but combat is so fast and exciting that such missteps are easy to overlook."", ""Part of the reason the combat enthralls from beginning to end is how brief fights are. With only a few enemies present in most fights, you can eliminate threats within a few minutes, so you're back exploring the impressive locales in no time. That makes you appreciate each encounter all the more, and there is enough variety so that every fight feels different. You may approach a camp in the dead of night and have the choice to pick enemies off stealthily or take your chances with a full-out rush, or, in another scenario, you're hanging upside down in a snare while enemies rush toward you. Other times you're rolling around in a room with destructible pillars, or plunging through a burning building, and every fight requires a slightly different approach. This variety helps keep the fights exciting. Plus, even though you have a standard assortment of guns, the bow proves to be both more satisfying to use and more challenging. Taking out someone with the bow with one perfectly logged headshot feels so empowering that I deliberately fought without guns so that every fight could be as exciting as possible."", ' ', ""Unfortunately, while the single-player exploits are both inventive and exciting, when you venture into multiplayer, things lose that glow. Everything here feels fine. Sticking an arrow right through someone's head is just as satisfying here as it is against an AI opponent, and there are even traps to stop unsuspecting players in their tracks. But it's all so expected. Whereas the solo quest veered from the norms in interesting ways, such as by offering fully explorable environments and putting such a small emphasis on combat, the multiplayer just recycles much of what has become the standard in competitive arenas. Sure, there isn't anything inherently wrong with such uninspired battles, but it's a shame there aren't more interesting elements to wrestle away your attention from other games out there."", ""What's most remarkable about Tomb Raider is how its many elements so perfectly complement each other, so that no matter which activity you're currently engaged in, you're fully invested. Even the straightforward platforming, in which Lara's sticky hands ensure there's little chance of failure, is thrilling thanks to brief quick-time events that keep your mind focused on even your smallest actions. There are two things that hit me when I first played Tomb Raider last year, and then resurfaced when I played through the Definitive Edition, that cement this as one of my recent favorites. Lara herself is so well crafted that I grew attached to her exploits and was sad to say goodbye when the credits rolled. And the exquisite visual design is so breathtaking that I continually found myself staring at the scenery instead of pushing onward. Tomb Raider is a great reinvention of this enduring franchise that made me eager to see where Lara goes in her future.""]"Brett Todd,24-Jan-14,Might & Magic X: Legacy Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/might-magic-x-legacy-review/1900-6415645/,6,PC,"['You need to have the nostalgia gene to fully appreciate Might & Magic X: Legacy. I do, especially when it comes to role-playing games, so I did. But this is one of those ""genre within a genre"" retro affairs that self-consciously turns its back on modern conventions and embraces what us old folks were stuck with back in that antediluvian era known as the 1990s. Limbic Entertainment has created an old-fashioned RPG epic that might well have landed on some ""best of"" lists at the end of 1996. If you\'re the sort of person who fondly remembers a time before the Might & Magic name meant nothing but turn-based fantasy strategy, this game is for you.', ""Noting that M&MXL is not for everyone isn't necessarily an insult, either. On the contrary, it's clear from the very first moments of the game that the developers are trying to be as unfashionable as a pair of acid-washed jeans. Everything about this game can be traced back to first-person party-based RPGs from the 1990s, like the original M&M games, the Wizardry series, and even the Eye of the Beholder D&D line. The campaign setting of Ashan is all new for this franchise, however, having been ported over from Might & Magic Heroes right down to the goofy winged helmets. Oddly enough, this approach actually makes M&MXL more of a traditional fantasy game than its forebears, as the original M&M role-players blended spaceships in with their swords and sorcery. Still, the general objective seems to have been to create a new game that picks up right where this style of RPG left off about 15 years ago."", ""And that mission has been accomplished. Well, mostly. Several core components of the game are well done. There is a fair amount of choice when it comes to character creation, with four races and 12 classes (three per race) spread along the might and magic spectrums. Don't expect anything more revolutionary than the likes of dwarven defenders, human freemages, elven bladedancers, and orc barbarians in the beginning, but you have a lot of freedom to specialize once your party starts leveling up and you begin doling out points between attribute stats and skills. You can specialize in everything from maces and bows to a whopping seven schools of magic, allowing for the custom-crafting of almost any sort of heroic adventurer that you can dream up. The sheer amount of liberty even allows for some evolution during gameplay. I started off with an elven ranger who I thought would be good in ranged combat, but I eventually realized that she worked better as a second spellcaster who specialized in healing. A few levels later, and I had an impressive cleric wannabe curing poison and dishing out restoration incantations when she wasn't offing foes with her bow and arrow."", ""It's clear from the very first moments of the game that the developers are trying to be as unfashionable as a pair of acid-washed jeans."", ""Managing your party is more involved than in most RPGs, so you can't just storm off looking for adventure. First, you need to take care of business by buying food. Without it, you're not allowed to rest, which soon causes your party to grow tired and drop ability scores. You also need to rest to regain health and mana, because neither regenerates on its own over time. Not much of this is spelled out, and the tooltips offered up at the start of the game don't do much to explain the basics. All becomes clear if you're patient, though, or if you remember doing this stuff many years ago. Nevertheless, the game could use more hand-holding in the beginning."", ""Like most RPGs released when grunge was still a thing, M&MXL features a first-person camera and grid-based movement where you move one step at a time. This system works relatively smoothly. Yes, you're stuck with an odd perspective that forces you to view the world as if the party were crammed into a car and looking out through the windshield, and the entire four-person party has to trudge as one through dungeons and forests, like a tank bristling with battle-axes and magic wands. But you soon get used to navigating in such a restricted fashion."", ""Movement has even been improved from the days of yore. M&MXL features turn-based combat, so you can't gimmick the system. Back in the day, it was common to cheat through real-time battles with tricks like the Eye of the Beholder Two Step, where you would zip forward to hit a monster and then immediately retreat before it could hit you back. Here, you're locked into battle once an enemy closes and the fight begins. So instead of dipsy-doodling back and forth, you're stuck going toe-to-toe with the bad guys. This results in some grueling combat, since you have virtually no range of motion once melee combat has started and no ability at all to choose the better part of valor and run away."", ""Managing your party is more involved than in most RPGs, so you can't just storm off looking for adventure."", 'In some ways, the game goes too far. Not only does it take away the exploits common to first-person RPGs in the \'90s, but it hammers away at you relentlessly (even at the lower ""adventurer"" setting). Combat is unforgiving right from the opening tutorial quest to clean spiders out of an underground lair. Monsters flank and surround you in almost every other fight, frequently spawning in out of nowhere to your rear. Just when you\'ve got your hands full with that minotaur in your face, along come two more to hassle you from behind. Most monsters also have devastating special abilities. Almost every enemy has the ability to stun you, poison you, enfeeble you, petrify you, hit you with extra attacks, and more. Wolves and goblins can insta-kill party members if they get lucky. I don\'t recall an easy battle in the entire campaign. That sounds sort of fun and intense, but really, I could have done without titanic half-hour struggles to best the likes of two goblins, a couple of cavemen, and a pack of panthers.', ""M&MXL isn't impossibly hard, but the punishing difficulty can lead to tedium. You can (eventually) beat any monster, group of monsters, or even the game's collection of brutally tough bosses by thinking about what you're doing when it comes to strategizing and spellcasting. The extreme challenge is a natural fit for a revamped classic, but that doesn't make the occasional bitter pill of a battle easier to swallow. When actually playing the game, I was too busy cursing out the nagas or spiders gooning me from all sides to appreciate the retro character of the battle difficulty."", 'How dated M&MXL is in other areas is harder to appreciate. The story isn\'t particularly well developed. The opening preamble is about as exciting as listening to someone recite a tax return, and there isn\'t much of a tale told during the game itself. Your party consists of a bunch of heroes, oddly called ""raiders,"" who are out to do good things for the human empire in a time of unrest. There isn\'t much role-playing to be had here; the game is a dry tactical affair where combat is the first order of the day, followed up by the odd puzzle.', 'Monster stock is limited. Areas and dungeons are populated by just a few specific types of creatures or human thugs, and the pace can drag because fighting the same fight over and over again. Loot isn\'t varied or particularly imaginative, either when it\'s dropped or when you check out what\'s available in shops. It gets better as you go, but there isn\'t a lot of memorable ""gotta have it"" gear. As a result, you can go for hours with few serious upgrades of weapons and armor. How items are doled out is also strange. Monsters don\'t tend to drop much when they\'re slain, but chests loaded with goodies and gold are strewn all over the wilderness like some kind of medieval take on geocaching.', 'The throwback production values are as traditional as the adventure itself, though these elements have not aged all that tastefully. Animations can be choppy, especially in forests, and slowdown is a common occurrence in the wilderness and when there are multiple lighting effects on the screen at the same time. Sound is also sparse, with what seems like a handful of weapon and monster effects. Hero battle boasts like the orc warrior\'s ""I kill you!"" are repeated constantly. Even worse, your heroes shout their cries of sadness about being knocked out or killed a few seconds before the blow is actually delivered, so you get advance warning when somebody is about to be taken down. This makes battles a teensy bit anticlimactic.', ""Might & Magic X: Legacy is a somewhat successful trip back in time to an era when RPGs were both simpler and more complicated than they are today, and a lot more demanding of players when it came to combat. If nostalgia drives you to visit this particular kingdom, you'll not likely regret the time spend there. If your good old days weren't brimming with games of this nature, it's more difficult to appreciate the take-no-prisoners challenge and overlook the limitations.""]"Miguel Concepcion,23-Jan-14,Assassin's Creed III: Liberation Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/assassin-s-creed-iii-liberation-hd-review/1900-6415643/,6,Xbox 360 & PS3,"[""As a former exclusive on the PlayStation Vita, Assassin's Creed III: Liberation arrived in time for the 2012 holidays as a promising system seller for Sony's fledgling handheld. While it fell short of its lofty goal, Liberation was nonetheless an impressive showcase of possibilities for open-world play on the portable platform. Now that it has been released on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, Assassin's Creed fans uninterested in the Vita can now experience all of the franchise's 18th-century storylines. Assassin's Creed: Liberation HD delivers what you would expect in upgraded visuals. And if you're hoping for the exact same gameplay that Vita owners experienced, you get that as well, even though it includes Liberation's original bugs."", 'Unlike other portable Assassin\'s Creed titles, Liberation continues the main narrative thrust of the major entries in the series. Aveline de Grandpre, the franchise\'s first playable female assassin, has intriguing ties to the protagonist of Assassin\'s Creed III, Connor Kenway, though it\'s a shame that Liberation doesn\'t feature more collaborative interplay between the two assassins. Liberation\'s framing premise also works as a prelude to the modern-day story portions of Assassin\'s Creed IV: Black Flag, since these adventures are the first two ""games"" by Abstergo Industries\' entertainment division.', 'Like Assassin\'s Creed III, Liberation is set in a time of upheaval, a common occurrence in the New World in the 1700s. The Spanish have taken control of New Orleans from the French, there\'s a defection among the Assassin ranks, and the governor of New Orleans is in cahoots with the Templars. And that\'s just the first couple of chapters in a story arc that spans 12 years. The supporting cast features some of the more colorful characters you\'ll find in an Assassin\'s Creed game, including a pair of enterprising smugglers and an unlikely mentor in the Louisiana bayou. Then there\'s Gerald Blanc, who supports Aveline in various capacities and represents the behind-the-scenes administrative side of the Assassin\'s Order (someone has to keep their books balanced). Think of him as Alfred to Aveline\'s Batman, except that Gerald also has a crush on Aveline. Gerald\'s bland personality puts the ""mild"" in mild-mannered, and his inability to organize his thoughts in front of Aveline makes him more of a frustrating character than an endearing one.', ""The supporting cast features some of the more colorful characters you'll find in an Assassin's Creed game."", ""The majority of Aveline's missions are fundamentally recognizable, right down to the tailing and escort missions. As an assassin's playground, New Orleans isn't particularly noteworthy; it's easy to get around, and you don't even need to rely on hopping fences or rushing down side alleys to evade pursers. The bayou is a fitting wilderness of surprises like alligator ambushes. With spotty pockets of settlements, the bayou can feel larger than it really is, even in spite of objective markers you can still get lost very easily. Aveline's objectives in the bayou mirror Connor's missions in the woods of Assassin's Creed III. She speedily navigates large tree branches while stalking hostiles on the ground."", ""When you have a game series that places such a huge emphasis on stealth, it's surprising that it wasn't until Liberation that a disguise system was introduced. The ability to don the persona of a socialite, a slave, and an assassin is reflective of Aveline's complicated background as the daughter of a French merchant and a slave, and the game forces you to use all three personas in equal measure, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. If you dress as a slave, you don't have to worry about sneaking around in a plantation, though you won't have your best killing tools available. Unsurprisingly, Aveline is most useful in her assassin garb, but she sticks out from the crowd. She is attractive no matter the outfit, though her socialite ensemble makes her the most welcome guest at parties. Not only does she come off as charming in conversation, but she even has a charm prompt whenever she's near guards and powerful men. It's an asset that other assassins lacked, though to be fair to the equally charming Ezio Auditore, he didn't have enough targets of the opposite sex to impress in his Assassin's Creed trilogy."", ""Liberation on consoles is best appreciated during combat. It's simply more comfortable to play on a PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360 controller versus the denser button layout of the Vita. This HD version made me feel more confident about using the series' defensive moves, not that I could have protected myself from every attack. The exploitable Assassin's Creed smoke bomb returns once again , allowing you to breeze through combat by killing up to four enemies without interruption. Luckily, the combat remains compelling; Aveline is both adept and brutal in her use of weapons, like the cleaver-shaped sugarcane machete."", ""Liberation's cinematics have been overhauled to the point that you don't need to hold up the Vita version to tell the differences in textures. In fact, the changes in skin tone, eyes, and other facial features are so significant that, depending on the lighting and camera angles, some characters don't even look like their Vita counterparts. Roaming New Orleans in higher resolution is impressive, even though it doesn't achieve the level of detail of Black Flag. By going from the 5-inch screen of the Vita to a 50-inch television, I had an easier time noticing lighting effects like the orange hue of candles illuminating windows at night or torches lit in the villages of the bayou."", ""If you're the type who expects HD remasters to be an opportunity for developers to fix the original version's bugs, expect some minor disappointments with Liberation HD. Don't be surprised if characters are positioned oddly during conversations, and don't expect rope swing functionality to work consistently. There are even issues that work to your benefit, such as when the game skips an entire combat sequence altogether. And while this game retains the series' notoriety system, it's easy to avoid confrontation. Guards are so slow to react to Aveline's presence that I didn't need to waste time tearing down wanted posters to decrease her notoriety."", 'Gerald\'s bland personality puts the ""mild"" in mild-mannered.', ""This ease of play speaks not only to Liberation HD's low difficulty level, but also to the lack of incentives to deviate from the storyline. The game isn't short on side missions, which include a foot race, the theft of a ship, and the freeing of slaves. Liberation HD does a poor job of letting you know that these missions exist, especially when the game doesn't raise financial hurdles that force you to raise funds and take a break from the story. Many missions in Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag required money and resources, which was a minor problem that could be overcome by hijacking ships or taking on optional assassination assignments. Liberation rarely encourages you to pursue side tasks, even though it has an economy system where you can kill business rivals and take over their shops, thereby making goods cheaper for yourself. The problem is that you don't need to buy a lot of things, and the game's most useful items, like the poison and berserk darts, often auto-replenish as you progress through the story."", 'Attaching ""HD"" to a previously released game often means you\'re getting a high-definition remaster rather than a remake with visuals reconstructed from the ground up. Judging by the quality of the cutscenes, developer Ubisoft Sofia aspired to the latter but ended up with the former. The time and care it put into those cinematics is obvious, so it\'s disappointing that the gameplay and its bugs--issues that existed in the Vita version--didn\'t receive the same level of attention. I still recommend Assassin\'s Creed: Liberation for fans of the series, but it\'s hardly worth revisiting if you\'ve completed the Vita version.']"Britton Peele,23-Jan-14,OlliOlli Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/olliolli-review/1900-6415646/,8,PlayStation Vita,"[""Many of the best skateboarding video games have traditionally had little to do with the sport of skateboarding itself. The Tony Hawk games were popular in part because they let you do things that Tony Hawk himself could not do, whether that was effortlessly pulling off a complex trick while jumping over a helicopter or grinding on top of tall buildings. OlliOlli, a 2D skateboarding game for the Vita, continues the tradition of defying both death and gravity with over-the-top stunts. With an absorbing trick system and rapid-fire stages that are perfect on the go, OlliOlli earns a place among skateboarding's gaming greats."", ""While OlliOlli is overall a very difficult game to master, on the surface its 2D gameplay is more approachable than most of its 3D skateboarding counterparts. Seemingly simple controls allow for surprising complexity, and it can take a while to get used to performing and, more importantly, landing tricks. You begin each stage already in motion, though you can shove with a tap of the X button if you find yourself in need of more speed. The stages are set up as one long run through decidedly non-skate-park environments--there are no halfpipes or pools to spend time in. The vast majority of your tricks, everything from your basic ollie (or jump, if you're not familiar with the skateboarding term) to your complex 360 inward heelflip, are accomplished by moving the left analog stick. Simply moving it up or down ollies, moving it to the right kickflips, and fighting-game-esque circular motions perform more advanced stunts. The act of releasing the stick initiates the trick, so you do a lot of flicking and releasing as you skate through environments."", ""OlliOlli earns a place among skateboarding's gaming greats."", 'Flicking the analog stick in various directions again while in the air allows you to grind on a variety of surfaces, including handrails and futuristic billboards; this is an absolute necessity if you want to keep combos going, which is key in getting the highest point totals. Holding either of the shoulder buttons lets you spin while doing tricks, opening up even more possibilities. Don\'t worry if you can\'t remember how to do a specific trick or grind, though. A built-in ""tricktionary"" contains a handy list of them all.', ""One of the toughest things to get used to in OlliOlli is the act of landing. Like the trick controls, landing is very simple on paper: hit X before you hit the ground. But it's amazing how often you can forget such a simple step or accidentally move the analog stick to grind when you really mean to land on solid ground. To further complicate things, you are rewarded with a perfect landing bonus (which rewards you with a burst of speed) if you wait until the very last moment to stick a landing or start a grind. For the game's harder challenges, nailing perfect landings is more of a requirement than a suggestion. A good sense of timing is your most important skill."", ""Once you get past the unique way OlliOlli controls, there are a lot of comparisons to draw between it and the Tony Hawk franchise. Each stage has a set of goals for you to complete, ranging from basic high-score targets to tasks like collecting items, grinding specific objects, completing a stage without pushing a specific trick, and so on. One major difference, however, is that OlliOlli's stages are not timed. When you crash, you're done. Most levels last little more than a minute, but making it to the end intact may take many tries, even if you're not trying to accomplish anything else at the time."", 'A good sense of timing is your most important skill.', 'As frustrating as it can be when you bail on a combo you\'ve been working on for an entire level, there\'s an exhilaration that comes when you finally nail it. OlliOlli is tough, but fair, and with practice, even the craziest tricks and combos are at your fingertips. Retrying a stage is possible instantaneously by tapping the Vita\'s screen, and the short nature of the levels makes it hard to resist quickly restarting when you screw up. Likewise, the joy of success tends to be followed up by the thought of, ""I bet I could keep my combo going longer if I could get just a little more height off this jump."" This comes together in the Daily Grind mode, which presents everybody with a single stage and one day to set a high score with a single combo. You can practice as much as you want, but you get only one chance to make your mark on that day\'s challenge. Don\'t choke and fall down the first set of stairs you come to when the pressure is on, not that I\'d know from experience or anything.', ""The chase for higher scores keeps you coming back for more, so it's unfortunate that the game's leaderboards don't allow for much analysis or comparison with your friends. Your high scores on each stage are uploaded automatically, and you're told where you rank worldwide, but there is no way to directly compare your performance with that of your buddies. You still feel the rush of competition and the desire to do better next time, but this would be more effective if more bragging rights were at stake."", ""Thankfully, lackluster leaderboards turn out to be one of OlliOlli's very few flaws. It's a wonderful arcade experience that not only demands both precision and speed, but has the tight controls necessary to make both possible. There's little reason that it couldn't work on systems besides the Vita, but OlliOlli is a great fit for the portable. Its bite-size stages are great for quick play sessions when you've got only a few minutes to spare, and mastering all the game's challenges takes awhile if you want to hunker down for longer periods of time. OlliOlli is a new skateboarding triumph that demands your attention."", ' ']"Kevin VanOrd,22-Jan-14,The Cat Lady Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-cat-lady-review/1900-6415644/,8,PC,"[""Suicide is final. Unless, that is, you are Susan Ashworth, the Cat Lady. A bouquet of flowers is a symbol of love, unless you are Susan Ashworth, for whom they are a reminder of loss. If you're Susan Ashworth, life isn't fair--even after you've exorcised the most harmful demons from your soul."", ""The Cat Lady is Susan's story--a story of painful tragedy and cautious redemption, disguised as a horror adventure game. And it is at Susan's end that the story begins."", ""The surreal field you traverse in the opening minutes is at turns beautiful and horrific, just as you might term The Cat Lady's overall visual language. Susan looks as though she's been cut from a magazine and superimposed onto old Polaroid photos. She and other characters move gracelessly, and simple facial animations simulate only the vaguest of lip motions. It's a weird and striking look, and one that allows certain sequences to land with a weighty thud, leaving you feeling anxious, shocked, or melancholy. The surreality of The Cat Lady's characters is most evident in two women that provide Susan plenty of grief--one of which you meet after Susan has already decided that death is preferable to the grief of living."", ""If you're Susan Ashworth, life isn't fair--even after you've exorcised the most harmful demons from your soul."", 'But even in death, Susan cannot find comfort. The old woman Susan encounters in this odd afterlife wants to strike a bargain, and Susan finds herself powerless to resist. There are monsters lurking in the world of the living, and if she hopes to find peace, Susan must vanquish them on behalf of this hag, this obstacle between her and her final rest. Just a few drops of blood should seal the deal.', 'The drops of blood you shed, however, are more than a few. And in return for her services, Susan receives the ""gift"" of temporary immortality--a gift that, for the suicidal, is a horrific curse. That first gruesome glimpse of bloodshed is an emotional bludgeon, and The Cat Lady smartly balances moments of quiet sadness with similar scenes of rage and misery throughout the game. It\'s important to note, however, that as shocking as some of these scenes are, they are not gratuitous, though at first they may seem so. Rather, The Cat Lady draws important parallels between Susan\'s suffering and the monsters she\'s been sent to annihilate. These monsters are incredibly, terrifyingly real, but they represent the depressed individual\'s enemies. And as anyone with depression might tell you, internal demons cannot be painlessly subdued.', ""The Cat Lady draws important parallels between Susan's suffering and the monsters she's been sent to annihilate."", ""The first of seven chapters effectively simulates Susan's confusion as she awakes in the hospital to find a sweet nurse at her side. But Susan is not inclined to share much about herself, and so early events, such as her reaction to a bouquet of flowers, are subtle mysteries that later become enlightened. Progressing is a matter of wandering from left to right with the arrow keys, accumulating objects, speaking with others, and solving puzzles by using those objects in particular ways. I was never stumped, but nor was The Cat Lady a complete cakewalk, though it isn't the challenge that the puzzles present so much as the atmosphere they create that makes them so interesting. To solve one early puzzle, for example, you must allow a psychiatric nurse to inject you with God knows what. You then find yourself in a foggy mental purgatory you must explore to move the story forward."", ""I know this haze. I've survived a suicide attempt, and I spent years in and out of hospitals as I traveled the road to recovery. The Cat Lady deftly depicts events and emotions I've experienced--the defiance toward doctors, the feelings of worthlessness, the mistrust of anyone attempting to get too close. More importantly, however, it also depicts the long road to recovery, and does so without sugarcoating the painful realities of life. For Susan, true hope first arrives in the form of a young woman named Mitzi. Mitzi's life is no less troubled than Susan's, but her manner of dealing with her hardships is far different, though not necessarily any less violent."", ""The two bond over one of The Cat Lady's more interesting mysteries, and the one that leads to the game's final catharsis. The puzzles throughout the later chapters become both more macabre and more playful. My favorite among them involves frightening Susan's upstairs neighbor, a sequence that's told in flash-forward as you describe to Mitzi the urban legend that inspired your prank. You can mold the outcome of certain story events in this chapter and others, though sometimes, the dialogue choices are more about building up your own image of Susan than they are actually steering the plot."", 'The puzzles throughout the later chapters become both more macabre and more playful.', 'Perhaps you come to The Cat Lady for the creep factor rather than for the remarkably human, empathetic story. There are a good number of eccentric and disruptive scenes, including one featuring a malformed, convulsive figure that shouts ""misery!"" when you approach. These scenes are carefully constructed for maximum effect so that even if you see the consequence coming (as I did in a puzzle involving some intricate machinery), you\'re still startled (as I was when I finished the puzzle). The horror is all the more effective for the quiet scenes that precede them, such as a flashback sequence that uses superimposed text to terrific, dramatic effect--and reveals the events that led to Susan\'s bottomward spiral.', ""Both Susan and Mitzi are ably voiced, as is much of the supporting cast. As Susan grows more confident, so too does the actress's performance crescendo from passionless victim to assertive companion. There are a few weak performances, a fast-talking Scottish mother among them, but it's the audio's recording quality that most detracts from the story. The voice-over often changes volume or tone abruptly, as if that particular line were recorded on a different day, in a different room, with a different microphone. Certain events, such as a ghastly one involving a bottle of bleach, are noticeably quiet, as if the intended voice-over and sound effects were never inserted. These aren't major issues, but given how important the sound and performances are in encouraging you to invest in Susan's struggles, they still stand out."", ""For Susan Ashworth, suicide is meant to be a way out, but it instead becomes a way forward. If you seek horror, The Cat Lady may sometimes freak you out, though probably not outright scare you.

These groups form the different factions and have their own vaguely defined play styles ranging from brutal, polluting industry to hyper-religious zealotry. Unfortunately, while they are thematically distinct, none of the factions stand out. Besides how the diplomatic options are phrased, and a few starting bonuses, they are all more or less the same. In my games, playing as the super-scientific faction wasn't terribly different from playing as the environmentalists. All of the units are the same, and the victory conditions are far too limited for any of your decisions to have much of an effect. There really is only one correct play style: extreme aggression."", 'Civilization has often been lauded for allowing you to seek scientific, cultural, military, or even diplomatic victory, and each of these routes is supported by an entire system of mechanics that help support that path. These systems connect with one another and can be attached or separated, giving you an enormous amount of freedom in how you play. Those choices are meaningful because they are symbolic; they represent different and distinct ideologies. Pandora, too, has ""different"" victory conditions, but none of them are well developed. There is a scientific victory that amounts to having 75 percent of all possible research items complete. To achieve military victory, you have to take control of over 75 percent of the planet\'s populace. Unfortunately, the mechanisms by which you accomplish these conditions are nearly identical, and there\'s virtually no way to stop a player who\'s nearing victory. The element of choice and the ability to consistently have any efficacy or agency in the game is totally subverted by this design.', 'The planet of Pandora is crawling with aliens when you first touch down, and it takes only a few turns for those forces to turn aggressive; unlike the barbarians from Civilization, these creatures are absolutely everywhere and are much, much stronger than any of your starting units. For example, a unit of marines has a starting combat strength of 2, while aliens range from 1 to 18, with 2 and 8 being the most common. How well you handle these early foes determines how much land and resources you have to work with in the mid to late game.', 'While it is meant to be a respectful tribute, Pandora is laden with awful design choices and a confusing mishmash of old and new mechanics.', ""Sadly, ignoring them isn't an option. Even if you never attack the aliens or show any sign of aggression, at a certain point they begin attacking you. Expanding and fortifying your armies, and then raiding alien hives for their massive cash reserves is the only way to play. Any land you don't grab for yourself is land a future opponent will use against you, and any aliens you don't kill feed the resources and experience of your rivals. This design choice forces the game into a two-stage system. The first stage is rapid expansion and extreme brutality against the indigenous aliens, and the second stage is focused more on developing the land you've claimed and steadily pushing back against enemies. While the first stage might be frustratingly limited, the second is fundamentally broken."", ""In better-designed 4X games, much of the mid- to late-game conflict stems from resource scarcity. You need a specific plot of land that an opponent has; this causes conflict, which then buttresses the final stages of a match. In Pandora, land is certainly important, but expansion is agonizingly slow. Even on the fastest setting, with the exception of a handful of rare tiles, there's absolutely no scarcity. Aside from mountains, just about every tile can be converted into every other kind, and they don't carry the bottlenecking effect that's common in other games. Without scarcity, there's very little to fight over, and the monotony of expansion across hundreds of same-y tiles wears down to tedium very quickly."", ""In place of a varied and interesting landscape, Pandora has a fairly robust unit upgrade and operations system. As you progress technologically, you have access to a wider variety of weapons and equipment for your various units. For example, initially your legions of marines only have access to their basic machine guns, but once you develop the flamethrower, you can bring marines back to a city to refit them with the latest gadgets. This is typically done for a significant cost, though, and can become overwhelmingly expensive when upgrading masses of units. Additionally, at each new stage of technological development, you also gain access to advanced versions of every unit. The colonial marine, your bread and butter, later becomes the assault trooper. After you've unlocked the next stage, it's often more practical to simply send your old units to their death at the hands of a foe and just start production on the next batch of souped-up soldiers"", ""To cut down on some of the banality of this cycle of production-upgrade-sacrifice, you can set your cities to crank out new units with the upgraded tech. This costs extra production time, but typically that's much easier to manage than trying to purchase all of the upgrades outright. Unfortunately, there's no system or mechanic allowing for the retrofitting of old units with new gear via production capacity, nor is there any way to take an old unit and make it into one of the newer variety. This is probably intended to be balanced by the experience system, which can dramatically enhance the combat effectiveness of older troops, but that loses relevance in the mid to late game because of operations."", ""Without scarcity, there's very little to fight over."", ""Operations can range from nuclear strikes and satellite scans to field training missions. They are produced much like standard units but are immediately consumed upon use. These field training missions are ridiculously cheap, particularly in the late game, and I often had one city of mine constantly producing them. After I finished a new batch of troops, I'd march them all to my most forward base, dump 10 field training missions on them to max out their level, and then let them heal up for two or three turns before marching out my legions of tanks, airplanes, and marines to conquer whatever stood in their way. It's much faster and less risky than trying to naturally level up fresh recruits, and it always ensured that my warriors would be at the top of their game."", ""At the end of the day, unit management is bogged down by a plethora of underutilized mechanics. Instead of adding to the gameplay, they simply encourage you to abuse other systems to circumvent the poorly designed interface. That seems to be par for the course for Pandora. There are a lot of neat ideas here, but none of them pan out. The game's creators clearly adore 4X strategy games in general, and Alpha Centauri specifically, is clear here, but Pandora: First Contact is not a proper tribute. I want to love Pandora, I really do, but nostalgia can't fix a game that doesn't work even at the most basic level.""]"Leif Johnson,21-Jan-14,Blackguards Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/blackguards-review/1900-6415641/,7,PC,"[""The next time you're having a bad day, consider the plight of poor Zurbaran. The lecherous mage might thrive on forbidden trysts and have an unhealthy attraction to prisons, but late in his travels he has an almost 89 percent chance to drown his enemies in pools of fire. And yet he misses. And when his shot at glory comes again, he misses again, but so do all the ruffians on his tail. Never has such a wizard suffered so much at the hands of numbers that should work in his favor. "", 'Blackguards bills itself as a ""dark"" fantasy, but the shades of gray here match Dragon Age better than Dark Souls. Even its opening prison-break scene channels ""lighter"" games like Oblivion and Baldur\'s Gate II, and the two prisoners you bring along (Zurbaran is one of them) resemble flawed poker buddies more than villains. It\'s a rogue\'s tale, in short, and the wider narrative of clearing your name of a murder you (probably) didn\'t commit sometimes gets lost in the business of undertaking predictable side quests doled out by shopkeepers or gambling dwarves. That\'s not always such a bad thing, however, because the limited cast of voice actors does well enough with the roles despite a few shudder-worthy performances.', 'Blackguards manages to maintain some of its dark pretensions through a visual style that shows its strengths in battle maps and the screens passing for towns.', ""The story itself pleases more than it disappoints. I eventually grew to love the dwarf warrior Naurim more than most of his bearded cousins in other games, and I enjoyed the poignant moments bracketing the tedious chapter middles. Blackguards manages to maintain some of its dark pretensions through a visual style that shows its strengths in battle maps and the screens passing for towns (although they look as though some cameraman smeared a touch too much Vaseline on the lens), even if it falters on character models. The town maps themselves may be little more than lovely hand-drawn landscapes with clickable non-player characters for merchandise, healing, and the like, but they do a fair job of capturing the group's trek from familiar European-style settings to the tropical landscapes in the south of Aventuria. Developer Daedalic even squeezes some exploration into this pile of scattered images, although the constraints of Blackguards' design keep it limited to clicks on lighted dots on dungeons and the ever-extending map."", ""This narrow approach to exploration springs from the turn-based battles at Blackguards' heart. Every battle in Blackguards is a set piece, designed exclusively for key story events or side quests, and this specialized approach gives it an advantage over randomized tactical favorites such as XCOM. You see it most in the heavy focus on interaction with environmental objects scattered throughout the hexagonal grids, and in its best moments, Blackguards uses them to craft more rewarding battles than we recently saw in The Banner Saga. Crypt lice swarm from holes unless you cover their burrows with stones, mini King Kongs rampage unless trapped in special gates, and in one of Blackguard's most taxing early moments, a massive troll must be pulled through gas ignited with Zurbaran's fire. The clincher? Blackguards rarely gives hints on how to pull off these stunts."", 'Every battle in Blackguards is a set piece, designed exclusively for key story events or side quests.', ""Therein lies part of Blackguards' niche appeal. It doesn't flinch at overwhelming odds; indeed, it revels in them out of a belief that today's games suffer from anemic strategies to accommodate wide audiences. A fair point, and true, it delivers Dark Souls-style satisfaction when your little band of antiheroes overcome a swarm of better-armed foes. It's the kind of game that forces you to keep slamming your head into figurative brick walls so you'll think hard enough to find the trap doors that pass under them."", 'Pity, then, that it stumbles in the execution. Blackguards\' challenges would be a lot more palatable if they weren\'t smothered by the absurd ""miss and dodge"" galas mentioned above, particularly in the first couple of chapters. Part of the frustration perhaps originates in the game\'s reliance on the pen-and-paper RPG The Dark Eye--more popular in Daedalic\'s native Germany than on this side of the pond--in that the dice rolls involved leave Blackguards\' otherwise enjoyable tough scrapes far too grounded in luck. Worse yet are the many battles that jump from one to another with no chance to rest, or battles pitting you against multiple waves of enemies with no clue as to how long they\'ll last.', 'Blackguards\' challenges would be a lot more palatable if they weren\'t smothered by the absurd ""miss and dodge"" galas.', ""Smartly leveling your character helps, but that in itself may prove a chore on the first playthrough owing to its open leveling system. The tutorials prepare you for so little of what's to come, in fact, that Daedalic is in the process of releasing videos demonstrating how to best use the three player classes of hunter, warrior, and mage. It doesn't help that the interface reeks of unintuitive design (save for an efficient radial menu for combat), or that Blackguards gives few clues as to how annoying weight stats grow as the gameplay matures. Elsewhere, key elements are rough. Offensive melee abilities remain far preferable to magic late in the game, particularly since Zurbaran spends at least two of the five chapters with little else besides variations on fireballs."", ""Blackguards' leveling system relies on the careful allotment of ability points earned from completing battles, which you then use as currency to raise stats, buy spells, or level weapon proficiency. Used right, the leveling system allows the creation of unique classes or a method of letting Zurbaran (for instance) counterbalance his shoddy mana reserves by earning crossbow skills. Use it poorly, and you find yourself saddled with skills for weapons that never drop or mages (the only magic users in the game) who can't heal worth a toss. Blackguards' set-piece design also means random encounters never pop up to allow grinding new points to replace misallocated ones, although side quests usually appear frequently enough to relieve the damage. The upshot? Blackguards is the kind of game that's best enjoyed on a second playthrough."", ""Blackguards' set-piece design also means random encounters never pop up to allow grinding new points to replace misallocated ones."", ""And there's the big question: is it worth suffering through all this a second time? It all depends on your devotion to the demands of its gameplay. Even a tumble through the first two chapters yields enough experience to justify starting over on normal difficulty, while a full playthrough should prepare most players for the seeming impossibilities awaiting on hard. And if you like a good story? The quality of Blackguards' story is generally good enough to justify tinkering with different choices to see how they lead to different outcomes. But make no mistake: this is a game aimed at the hardcore crowd seeking a good struggle above all else, and on that front, it mostly delivers.""]"Leif Johnson,17-Jan-14,CONSORTIUM Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/consortium-review/1900-6415633/,6,PC,"['One thing\'s for sure: Consortium isn\'t afraid to hide one of its chief influences. Mere minutes in, responding to a quip from the pilot of a futuristic craft crammed with quasi-military types, I jumped on the best of three possible responses: ""So you\'re the ship\'s joker, right?"" Had it used a capital ""J,"" developer Interdimensional Games might as well have shouted out its inspiration. Indeed, Consortium is partly Mass Effect stripped of all that business of exploring worlds and drilling planets, opting instead to unfold events in an aircraft from 2042 that feels like the Normandy and looks strikingly similar to a Boeing 747. L. Ron Hubbard would be proud. But this isn\'t some soulless rip-off; look past crippling bugs and visual oddities, such as water faucets that seem to spit mercury and the Tomb Raider-circa-2003 faces, and you\'ll find a role-playing game experience that\'s at least worthy of breathing the same air as BioWare\'s space saga.', ""Consortium presents us with a distinctly European vision of the future, down to quips about how Americans no longer make the best stuff in 2042. It's populated with a motley selection of nationalities and races that work for a peacekeeping organization that may or may not have sinister intentions, and the entire concept hinges on a military hierarchy that labels people with the names of various chess pieces. You, for instance, take on the role of Bishop Six, a warrior enforcer of sorts on his first day on the job, and your presence leads you to butt heads with the knight in charge or tease unfortunately named pawns about relieving themselves in the brig toilet. As the plot reveals, it's a fun job, and you end up investigating murders, sniffing out traitors, attempting to tame mercenaries with diplomatic skills, and sometimes even fighting."", ""Taking on roles isn't a figure of speech in this case. One of Consortium's most fascinating quirks is that its meta-narrative assigns you the role of a contemporary player in a satellite-based game that lets you slip into the minds of figures from alternate futures. (Top that one, Oculus Rift.) It initially seems like little more than a tired Assassin's Creed-inspired conceit, but only minutes in, Consortium lets you blurt out the truth to your underlings if you wish. Part of what makes Consortium so appealing is that such playful sallies affect the game's more serious preoccupations with murders, subterfuge, and even cocky Bulgarian recidivists who attack you with antique fighter jets in order to stay off the sensors. Push it too far, and the talking chess pieces around you might start to doubt your ability to lead them to checkmate."", ""It's generally fun to hear them talk. While some of Bishop Six's responses exhibit an unfortunate smidge of juvenile phrasing, the surrounding crew members exude a degree of humanity barely suggested by their antiquated models. Pause too long before answering as I did while taking notes, and they cut off the conversation out of a belief that you're either rude or just don't want to answer. Conversations flow well from one to another regardless of shifts in subject matter, and Consortium tops it all off with a generally competent voice cast. This works well when you hear Knight 15's confidence waver in the face of little human errors, which makes her leadership seem more believable, or even when crewmembers of various ranks argue over whether to announce the discovery of a murdered rook's corpse."", 'Push it too far, and the talking chess pieces around you might start to doubt your ability to lead them to checkmate.', ""It's fitting, then, that the ship itself is as much of a character as the crewmembers who populate it. Not unlike Cowboy Bebop, Consortium walks a fine line between the familiar and the far-fetched, and that mixture adds a touch of creepiness as you hunt the rooms for clues and hobnob with crewmembers who balk when you question things that someone in your position should know. You spend almost all your time on the ship, and it's thus a good thing that its three decks offer plenty of exploration to make up for the absence of any ground exploration on your way from Bulgaria to London. Partly thanks to the inclusion of a sweeping musical score by composer Jeremy Soule of Elder Scrolls and Guild Wars fame, the mere act of exploring its air ducts and closed rooms is a pleasure in itself."", ""Consortium also serves as a decent if uninspired first-person shooter, even to the point of including a prompt at the beginning that adjusts the difficulty for story or action. It's a familiar enough concept, but Consortium goes further than most games by letting you avoid almost all of the gunplay by focusing on careful answers and juggling the dispositions of various enemies and friends. It's a more rewarding approach to Consortium, much like playing Dishonored with an exclusive focus on stealth. Yet shooting is so secondary to the general drive of Consortium that much of it occurs in training exercises in a holodeck of sorts, or through a brief virtual dogfighting sequence. There are no specializations or skills to tinker with--only a smattering of weapons and the ability to incapacitate downed soldiers or to heal allies around you."", ""And man, is Consortium glitchy. I spent my first few days with the game occasionally unable to get far beyond the loading screen without the computer locking up; I later learned to wait it out for about five minutes. And there's an otherwise impressive sequence late in the game that can cause all manner of problems. I struggled with it myself until the devs posted a workaround on the Steam forums last Tuesday that allowed me a peek at what passes for the end. The issues are so severe that Interdimensional now has a disclaimer on its Steam page acknowledging and apologizing for the troubles, along with the hopeful news that the problems should clear up with a bulky patch toward the end of the month."", ""It's a shame, because Consortium delivers a uniquely enjoyable RPG experience despite its rather disappointing running time of around four to five hours. That's not as bad as it initially sounds, however, since you discover remarkable differences in gameplay depending on how you make your decisions throughout the game (and on whether you decide to shoot up the place), thus lending Consortium a dose of replay value. For now, at least, it's best to wait. Consortium has a fascinating story to tell that leads you down some bizarre narrative pathways that break the fourth wall, and it's likely best experienced when you can get it to play without crashing or bugging out. Considering that it's partly a game about time travel, a couple of weeks isn't that long to hold out.""]"Britton Peele,17-Jan-14,Nidhogg Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/nidhogg-review/1900-6415634/,8,PC,"[""You throw your sword at your opponent's head and curse as it's deflected. You're now defenseless, and your opponent knows it. He runs at you, ready to strike. You have only half a second. You roll backward, grab an old sword off the ground, and get it up just in time to impale your opponent as he reaches you. This buys you a precious moment to gain a little ground before he respawns."", ""This all happens within seconds, and in a good game of Nidhogg, it's the kind of thing that happens multiple times."", ' ', ""Nidhogg is part fighting game, part tug-of-war. Two fighters enter at the center of a 2D side-scrolling arena, armed with only a sword. You can move your sword to one of three different heights (low, medium, and high), and the combat works like fencing: you don't swing; you stab. If you and the other player have your swords at the same height, the blades will clash, making the question of where and when to strike a mind game. A well-timed change in sword position can disarm your opponent, leaving him open to be pierced through the torso (or head, if you're so positioned). Tapping a direction takes a small step, while holding runs. If you want to get a little fancier, you can dive-kick, roll, cartwheel, throw your sword, or, if empty-handed, try to pummel your opponent with your fists. All with only two action buttons: jump and attack. Rarely do games with such simple controls offer so much variety in their actions."", ""The first person to kill the other gets to run toward his or her goal like a football player dashing for the end zone. That fight is not the end, however, because you continue to respawn until you have either won or lost. If you can come back and kill the other player before he reaches his goal, you gain control of the screen and can make a mad dash for your goal instead. To take the football analogy further, it's like forcing your opponent to fumble and then running away with the ball, until he wrestles the ball back from you and goes their way again until somebody finally scores. A single game could just as easily last 20 seconds as 20 minutes, depending on the skill of both fighters. The back-and-forth between two well-matched players is thrilling, and there's a pure exhilaration that comes from being on the brink of a loss, making the right move at the right time, and fighting your way back to win."", ""Nidhogg's battles can be intense in part because the playing field is perfectly even. There are no special characters to select, and every arena is symmetrical. Nobody starts with an advantage, and your victory or failure depends entirely on your own skill. Some strategies may seem to be surefire ways to succeed, but that's only true until your opponent catches on to what you're doing and learns how to defend against it."", 'You can fight on four different stages, each of which sports unique features to differentiate it from its brethren. One stage features areas with tall grass that hides the position of your sword, making close-quarters duels more of a guessing game. Another stage features long, narrow corridors that negate the usefulness of both jumps and sword throws. Everybody is likely to have a favorite stage, though the overly bright first screen of the Clouds stage might cause headaches for some.', 'Even though only two people can play at a time, Nidhogg is an excellent game for parties or other group activities. A built-in tournament mode facilitates up to eight players, and you can mix things up with gameplay variants such as low-gravity boomerang mode, where thrown swords come back to their original owner, or baby mode, which forces both fighters to crawl everywhere (good for an initial laugh but not the most enjoyable way to play). While there are tricks to pick up, there are no complex moves to learn. Nidhogg has all the intensity of a close fighting-game match without most of the complexity.', 'If you don\'t have any local friends to play with, your options are severely limited. A single-player mode lets you fight a string of AI fighters, which can be a lot of fun and perfect training for human opponents, but it can be ""beaten"" in about 30 minutes even by a beginner. It welcomes replays, but fighting the computer isn\'t nearly as satisfying as fighting a friend, and none of the multiplayer variants are available to a single player. Nidhogg is a game made for friendly competition, and you won\'t find much if you intend to play alone.', ""This wouldn't be as much of an issue if Nidhogg satisfactorily delivered on one of its promises: online multiplayer. Unfortunately, every match of the more than 20 I played was plagued by lag that ruined the experience. This isn't as noticeable if you're the player hosting the game (which could lead you to think you're a Nidhogg savant if you don't know any better), but as a guest player, you find yourself warping around the stage, landing a killing blow that doesn't actually kill your foe, and getting stuck while grabbing ledges. Even matches that aren't as loaded with these problems suffer just enough to make the experience disappointing at best and frustrating at worst."", 'There are other rough edges here and there, such as the apparent lack of D-pad support (at least on the Xbox 360 controller I played with) and the fact that not every menu can be controlled with the controller, though the game\'s Steam page claims ""Full Controller Support."" These are mostly small inconveniences that will hopefully be ironed out later in Nidhogg\'s life, as was the game\'s tutorial, which was broken at launch.', 'It would be easy to glance at Nidhogg and wonder how it could possibly be worth the price. The graphics look crude (though there is a fluidity to the animation that fits the action well), the single-player is almost nonexistent, and there are only four stages. Indeed, if you intend to play alone, Nidhogg is almost certainly not the game for you.

As Wilson, a scientist-turned-survivalist, you're plunked down into this randomly generated world and left to figure everything out on your own. Outside of some light questing and very minimal story elements, the emphasis is placed on your survival. Rather than being a detriment, the hands-off direction paves the way for the world's grim Tim Burton-esque vibe and entrancing visual design to unfurl, telling its own harrowing tales as you struggle to stave off death."", ""When it comes to figuring out how to stay alive, there's precious little handholding here. The lack of any tutorial means that every resource, creature, and curiosity you encounter poses a two-pronged question: how can I use this to my advantage, and will messing with it somehow result in getting killed? Considering that many vital resources can be perilous to acquire or have an ill effect if used improperly, each choice you make at any given moment has the potential to usher in your own doom. This trial-and-error nature is a real pressure cooker at moments, since even a simple slipup like overharvesting a scarce material can send you into a downward spiral. The constant tension that builds as important supplies dwindle ratchets up the stressfulness of each dire situation, but it makes each victory, however small, feel like a major achievement.

A steady day-night cycle weaves several more layers of complexity into the mix. You can freely explore during the daytime, but nightfall ushers in a new threat: get caught in the dark for more than a few seconds without a light source, and the darkness itself consumes you. Spending too much time out in the dark, even by torchlight, saps your mental health as well. Activities like eating flowers, resting, and tinkering away restore your sanity. Let it deplete too far, however, and the increasingly hallucinatory visual effects that warp the gameworld onscreen spawn imaginary nightmare creatures that attack. Really, you never feel truly safe.

Mundane materials like wood, flint, grass, and rope can be forged into axes, spears, torches, and more. Your collecting and tinkering thankfully don't end there.

The dual thumbsticks make quick work of juggling inventory items too, and the overall scheme is a comfortable improvement for crafting.

Aside from the lack of mod support, one notable difference is the reduced control for fine-tuning custom games in the console version. There's some wiggle room to toggle the frequency of individual creatures and elements, but it's scaled back here. That's a minor concession, since the core game is well done and is a great fit on the PS4."", ""Even so, some of the underlying problems still linger. Don't Starve's roguelike aspect is utterly grueling in the way it doles out punishment.

Stripped-down versions of base building and resource gathering round out the tactical provisions. Bases are limited to a single structure, divided into partitions for specialized renovations. Nodes that dot the map provide a steady drip of materials for units and upgrades, and a strategic objective for you skirmish over."", 'Another bit of middle school pedantry is the difference between ""simple"" and ""simplistic""--one agnostic, the other damning. Games have long struggled to land on the proper side of that dividing line; sadly, Frozen Hearth veers in the wrong direction. It begins with a low-grade simulacra of other medieval fantasy strategy games, and only removes elements from the formula. Take the paring-down of traditional base-building mechanics, for example. It certainly simplifies the RTS, but it\'s also simplistic. There are only a few rote renovations that can be made, to be slotted into the preordained spaces of the larger structure. Without any territorial expansion, there\'s little reason to divide forces, save to briefly distract enemy forces. Nothing upends the core gameplay loop of spamming units and pointing them toward the nearest contested resources.', ""Avatars, for their part, function as the hero characters of Frozen Hearth's MOBA half, imbued with greater strength than a run-of-the-mill unit and a host of spells and abilities that can turn the tide of a skirmish."", ""It's here that I'd hypothetically point to the hybridization of the RTS and the MOBA as Frozen Hearth's finest touch. As the game's closest thing to an original offering, it's burdened with the responsibility of shoring up the otherwise dull experience. And perhaps it might have, were it not undermined by Frozen Hearth's variety of technical woes. The game is unusually taxing on a fairly robust system, regularly experiencing frame rate dips, screen tears, and janky miscellanea on medium settings. Unusual, because the game isn't much of a looker even when the graphics are turned up to eleven. The rudimentary units become indistinguishable when the action heats up, and the Avatars run the gamut from garden-variety shirtless warrior to humdrum hooded priest."", ' ', ""Units move over the terrain in a preternatural, detached glide--that is, when they're not vibrating ineffectually against each other like electronic football pieces. Sic too many on one foe, and the rest mill about absentmindedly when they can't find room to attack. Unchaperoned units wander off into enemy formations, seemingly on a whim. Pathfinding is unreliable; two adjacent units with the same destination often take different routes. There's no attack-move command, so should your units come under attack in the midst of their travels, they'll plod along heedlessly until they're killed. Many a campaign match is lost because a hero or a unit gets tragically separated from the group during a few seconds that it's unattended, usually a long way into a tedious, multistage battle of attrition that needs to be repeated in full should you fail in the home stretch. The unreliable mechanics suppress your ability to play the mind games that run astride better strategy titles; any time you lift your head up to survey the field, something goes wrong."", ""Intermittently it feels as if Frozen Hearth were conceived as a challenge to see which side could better shepherd its particular herd of cats. Or click on a singular desired unit out of a shapeless mass of like bodies. Or trick the artificial intelligence into a lapse of logic while the other side is preoccupied fighting against the unergonomic user interface or the uncomfortably close camera angle. It's a challenge, to be sure, but so is crossing the Sahara. The desert might even give more back."", ' ']"Heidi Kemps,16-Jan-14,Dr. Luigi Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dr-luigi-review/1900-6415627/,5,Wii U,"['I have had an interesting relationship with Dr. Mario since its birth on the NES more than two decades ago. It was one of a very, very few games everyone in our humble Midwestern house was keen to play: my mom, my sister, me, and even my dad, who has barely picked up a controller in his life. There was something magical about the game among the Kemps family, but as years passed and new games and consoles came into the house, less and less time was spent with visits to the good doctor.', ""Dr. Mario has made reappearances on consoles since, of course, and I went back and played these incarnations, remembering the good times I had both alone and with my kin. But something had changed. I'd played games like Puyo Pop, Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo, and Magical Drop in the meantime--games designed to make you both think and move quickly in a competitive environment. When I would return to Dr. Mario, something was off. It felt slow-paced and sluggish, with more tension coming from a heavily virus-filled playfield than from trying to outwit and react to your opponents and their setups. I wondered if, perhaps, Dr. Mario had lost some of its luster due to the genre's evolution. After having played Dr. Luigi, I'm now pretty confident that this is the case."", ""Dr. Luigi is essentially an upgrade of 2008's Dr. Mario Online RX; it's made by the same developer, Arika, and reuses many of its graphical and sound assets. Mario has bequeathed his practice to his younger brother, Luigi, who seems to have his hands full with a new batch of alien-virus creatures to systematically eliminate. The basic gameplay is the same; two-colored pills fall onto a playing field littered with viruses, and you must line up four or more of the same colors vertically or horizontally to eliminate both pill pieces and viruses in the stack. Set up chains that eliminate several viruses at once to either earn a score boost or cause a headache for your opponent. Kill all the viruses, and it's on to the next stage (or match, if you're playing versus)."", ""But since a straight rerelease of Dr. Mario with some altered visuals and sound wouldn't cut it in today's market, Dr. Luigi offers some variants on the formula. Some of these have appeared before: Virus Buster, first seen in Brain Age 2 and reintroduced in Dr. Mario Online RX, gives you a smaller playfield where you use the stylus and the Wii U GamePad to place pills. It's a nice improvement from the clumsy Wii Remote controls the previous game used, and the ability to play in vertical or horizontal gamepad orientation is a plus. Another semi-new mode is a versus variant called Flash, again from Online RX. The goal in Flash isn't to eliminate all the viruses in the bottle before your opponent, but rather to off a few specific flashing viruses. Online mode is just that: the ability to play Dr. Mario against anyone on earth minus that pesky restriction of needing to be in the same room."", ""Unique to Dr. Luigi is Operation L mode. Instead of the megavitamins every Dr. Mario player is familiar with, you get two such pills frankensteined together in an L shape. It sounds mildly interesting on paper, but in practice, Operation L is a disappointment. Skilled Dr. Mario play involves your ability to carefully maneuver pills into hard-to-reach places. The big, clunky L pills are so large and unwieldy that advanced placement becomes impossible. When you're aiming to eliminate all the viruses on the field in single or versus play, which is already pretty slow going, Operation L limits your options instead of adding depth or complexity."", ""Beyond the selection of different play types--Operation L, Virus Buster, and so forth--there are a handful of settings you can adjust: starting stage, speed, and music. If you were hoping for things like precrafted puzzle challenges to test your pill-placing prowess or a story mode, features popularized by many modern puzzle games, you'll be disappointed to find that there isn't much beyond the options offered 24 years ago."", ""When you're aiming to eliminate all the viruses on the field in single or versus play, which is already pretty slow going, Operation L limits your options instead of adding depth or complexity."", ""Versus mode options are basic as well, which makes the tendency for games to turn into drawn-out, slow-speed races to kill every virus on your screen all the more aggravating. Forget the momentum-shifting opponent punishments of games like Puyo Pop and Puzzle Fighter; your reward for setting up impressive combos in Dr. Luigi is a few piddly pill bits dropping in. (In Operation L mode, you change your opponent's next piece into something else--usually a color jumble that's near impossible to place--which is infuriating to the recipient but lacks the smug satisfaction of a screen full of slop piling down on your foe.) Flash is considerably more fun, challenging you to find the fastest way possible to eliminate specific viruses before your foe does, a process that involves some clever thinking and careful movements."", ""Online play, meanwhile, is functional but extremely bare-bones. Dr. Luigi features basic two-player lobbies and a ranked mode, which rarely puts you up against equally skilled opponents. Want to change the type of game you're playing? You need to step out, re-create the room, and hope your buddy rejoins. Don't expect anything like tournament modes or even the best-three-out-of-five battles the original NES version offered, either; after one round, you're kicked back to the continue-or-quit screen."", ""In the end, Dr. Luigi feels like Dr. Mario Online RX all over again, with a few spruced-up elements and a not-well-thought-out extra mode. That alone would be enough to make you wary of dropping the full $14.99 asking price on this. But in the end, the most disappointing part of Dr. Luigi is that it doesn't give the Dr. Mario formula that shot in the arm it needs to feel magical again. Arika is the mind behind the amazing Tetris: The Grand Master series of arcade games, and I'm disappointed that it can't bring a similar thrill and exhilaration to this classic series. But it could well be that Dr. Mario's pacing and mechanics are relics of its era that would be difficult to bring up to modern standards. Dr. Luigi provides some shallow entertainment, but it's not exactly what the doctor ordered.""]"Maxwell McGee,15-Jan-14,Broken Age Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/broken-age-act-i-review/1900-6415631/,7,PC,"[""Elsewhere, Shay rises for another mundane day aboard the Bossa Nostra, a spaceship designed to keep him safe and free from harm.

An ancient and powerful monster, Mog Chothra, is coming, and Vella will be offered as a sacrifice of appeasement. This is a high honor, both for Vella and her family."", ""Vella and Shay costar in Broken Age, a coming-of-age story that finds both heroes struggling to break free of their stations in life. You can switch between these two freely, and help guide Vella and Shay as the innocent worlds of their youth collapse around them to reveal the often harsh realities of adulthood. It's a somber tale, but one that is tempered by the colorful and humorous style that has become developer Double Fine's hallmark."", 'As a point-and-click adventure game, Broken Age charges you with logic puzzles rather than dexterity challenges. Vella decides, against the warnings of her family, to fight Mog Chothra, while Shay devises a plan to outsmart the overbearing spaceship and take control of it for himself. You accomplish both objectives by talking with others and collecting items--tasks that are punctuated with some great humor that keeps you excited to see what sorts of wacky scenarios the game will throw at you next.', ""Whether you're hopping between head-shrinking teleporters or steering a spaceship by way of scarf knitting, Broken Age isn't afraid to juxtapose its more serious plot points with ridiculous activities. One puzzle finds Vella trying to extract sap from a talking tree. The tree is not forthcoming since it believes Vella is a tree-killing psychopath. Vella decides to own this title by showing the tree a hand-carved stool and describing how the wood was cut up and fashioned into furniture. Disgusted, the tree promptly expels its sappy contents."", ""Vella's and Shay's worlds may be silly, but they always maintain a consistent logic that helps you work out these problems. Solving a puzzle is never a matter of combining two wildly different things to make a random object unrelated to the task at hand. These puzzles may be silly, but they also make sense."", ""While this game has you juggling two entirely separate sets of puzzles--one for Vella and one for Shay--the puzzles themselves feel basic and their solutions are straightforward. The complexity of these puzzles does ramp up slowly as you progress further in the game, but it gets cut short when you reach Broken Age's early conclusion. Presumably, since this is only the first half of the full game, the puzzles will continue to grow more complex in the second act, but this remains to be seen."", ""Whether you're hopping between head-shrinking teleporters or steering a spaceship by way of scarf knitting, Broken Age isn't afraid to juxtapose its more serious plot points with ridiculous activities."", ""When you're not worrying about brainteasers, Broken Age's vibrant world is a delight to explore. The bright, pastel coloring and soft lighting lend the game's backdrops a storybook aesthetic that complements the game's humorous writing while also contrasting with--and emphasizing--its darker plot. At times, you feel as if you're dashing through the pages of a Dr. Seuss book. Some fantastic voice work further enhances this experience, with a couple of great performances by characters seen only once or twice in the game. Hopefully, these characters will make a return in the second act."", ""Broken Age's world may be fun to explore, but don't get too comfortable. Just as you fall into a steady groove with its story and puzzles, the game ends. Thankfully, the ending provides some resolution while also leaving you excited for the second act.

Retaining its predecessor's most appealing elements, while fixing most of its problems, 2010's Dementium II cemented the series as a cult favorite among those who wanted to be scared on the go. Recently rereleased on the PC as Dementium II HD, the sequel has stepped up its visual presentation, but otherwise represents a shuffling zombie step backward for the franchise."", 'To be fair, Dementium II HD isn\'t just another mindless undead shooting gallery. While its disturbing asylum setting is populated by its share of Resident Evil rejects, it borrows more from Silent Hill 2 than recent so-called ""survival horror"" fragfests like RE6 and Dead Space 3. As a mental hospital patient barely recovered from brain surgery, you must navigate the institution\'s appropriately creepy, creature-inhabited halls. From its bloodied walls and dilapidated medical equipment to the unsettling cackles and cries traveling down its dank corridors, the setting\'s sights and sounds are too familiar but still manage to create a milieu in which BioShock\'s Dr. Steinman would feel comfortable performing human experiments.', ""Enemy encounters are similarly tired but serviceable. While a handful of foes--mostly of the boss variety--may sow the seeds of your future nightmares, the majority possess the kind of unnatural movements, misplaced limbs, and fang-filled maws we've come to expect from the genre's hell-spawn and virally infected freaks. Behind a well-balanced, varied arsenal that includes sledgehammers and sticks of dynamite among its choices, combat is satisfying, albeit not specifically fine-tuned for a gamepad; where the first-person mechanics offered some welcome novelty when using a DS stylus, they're merely competent on the PC."", ""When not emptying ammo clips or engaging in up-close melees with the game's oozing cast of monsters, you tackle light puzzles and explore parallel worlds; the former activity is uninspired, tedious filler, while the latter sees you alternating between a twisted world of nightmarish monsters and a more realistic realm populated by baton-wielding hospital guards. The parallel-world concept is cool--even packing the occasional surprise and genuine goose-bumps-inducing scare--but without any interesting character interactions or strong narrative support to speak of, it comes off a bit like a forgettable B movie."", 'The core adventuring, comfortably freakish foes, and trite story and setting are pleasantly familiar at best, and dated and unmemorable at worst.', ""That same sentiment sums up most of the Dementium II HD experience. It's by no means a bad game; it's just a painfully subpar one. The core adventuring, comfortably freakish foes, and trite story and setting are pleasantly familiar at best, and dated and unmemorable at worst. As promised in the title, the visuals have received a makeover; slicker lighting and smoother textures, however, aren't enough to make this high-res facelift look particularly up to date."", ""The game's portable roots also reveal themselves in its brevity. Originally crafted for the handheld, its four- to six-hour campaign felt right for mobile players craving bite-size play sessions; on the PC, though, its length serves as yet another reminder that this was a game meant to be played on the subway or in the dentist's office. More specifically--at least for this longtime fan--the Dementium series was one to be relished in the wee hours, preferably under the covers on a cold night with the lights out, earbuds securely inserted."", ""Three years ago, splashed across the DS's dual screens, Dementium II--and even the game that spawned it three years prior--was a novelty, a dedicated first-person survival horror experience exclusive to a platform that didn't offer anything else like it.

These colorfully clothed warriors cut a striking silhouette against the bleak, frozen landscape. Snowflakes waft by and craggy mountains stretch across the horizon. These travelers seem so small, so insignificant, when viewed against the chilled backdrop. The caravan encounters a troop of thieves and must reach a decision: invite the thieves to join the roving party in the hopes they might bolster the defenses, or send them away out of fear, assuming they will steal precious supplies. In The Banner Saga, you face these kinds of decisions all through the game's 10-hour campaign, making choices, and then clenching your jaw and hoping your trust was properly placed. Sometimes it is, and sometimes it isn't. Sometimes, you feel in control of your destiny, and sometimes you feel like your destiny is at the whim of the elements."", ""Making decisions with unclear consequences is The Banner Saga's main thrust. You spend most of your time watching several expeditions of men and giants cross the frigid Scandinavian landscape and rest in the villages and encampments they encounter. The automated journey is interrupted frequently with events that require your input. A woman has been murdered, and her mother blames another traveler. Do you support the accuser, do you support the accused, or do you dig deeper into the conflict? An obnoxious general questions your leadership and threatens to run off into the wilderness with his own men. Do you argue for him to stay? Do you send him away, thinking that perhaps he might return and grovel for mercy later? You can't presume anything. Kindness can lead to disaster. Harshness can lead to triumph. All you can do is follow your instincts, apply some logical reasoning, and hope for the best."", ""This is an intriguing approach to strategy and storytelling, and it often works. Each day spent hiking uses up supplies; should you run out, you start losing clansmen, warriors, or giantlike varl to famine. Furthermore, the resource called renown, which you use to purchase more supplies in the towns you visit, is the same you use to promote your heroes, whom you lead into turn-based battle. At one point, I ran out of supplies, and watched in sadness as the game informed me of my losses. My best intentions led me astray, and those mistakes cost lives. It wasn't so much the loss of life that I regretted, however, but my own failures as a commander. Fewer fighters and varl meant potentially harsher battles if I couldn't order those unnamed masses to thin out the hordes of armored enemies known as the dredge before leading my heroes to victory."", ""The story takes an impressive number of turns based on your choices, weaving a twisted tapestry of unlikely alliances and disastrous betrayals. Repercussions might manifest immediately, or quite some time later, and it's a treat to watch larger plot points transform after your manipulations. But The Banner Saga never goes out of its way to point out its own intricacies; it allows events to simply occur, and as a result, the decision-making process feels organic, rather than game-ish and contrived. I'm eager to return again (and perhaps even again), to see how many stories I can help tell, and to plumb the depths of the game's complexities. I am often loath to return to choice-driven games, in part because I feel ownership of the narrative. In Mass Effect, I don't just play as Commander Shepard--I play as my Commander Shepard. I could have taken a different route through Heavy Rain, but the one I took was my story; playing again with different decisions would diminish the personal touch my original playthrough offered. On the one hand, The Banner Saga's diverse parade of characters kept me from feeling invested in any given individual's destiny. On the other hand, the lack of emotional connection inspires me to return so that I may pull the marionette strings differently. The Banner Saga cares less about building meaningful connections and more about testing the limits of your leadership."", ""That said, there are times when I wish there were a more obvious and consistent connection between my decisions and the results. And by the time it had drawn to a close, the story I had co-authored had gone off the rails. A major plot point had been almost entirely buried, and while I was moved by the ending, I was shocked when the credits rolled immediately afterward. This saga is meant to continue at a later time, but even so, the cutoff point for this chapter felt random and rather unfulfilling. A final battle brings some closure, at least, but there's no sense of narrative climax."", 'Sometimes, you feel in control of your destiny, and sometimes you feel like your destiny is at the whim of the elements.', ""Battles against the dredge occur on a grid, and if you've ever played a turn-based strategy game, you'll be immediately familiar with the basics. Before combat begins, you must consider which heroes to bring to battle. Choose wisely: different heroes have different special abilities, and if they haven't recovered from the previous battle, they're less effective in this one. In fact, choosing whether to rest in villages prior to travel is an additional consideration, given that rested heroes are more powerful on the battlefield, but resting uses up a day's worth of supplies. Once you reach the battlefield, you must pay attention to armor values as well as health values. Furthermore, you must conserve and spend a resource called willpower wisely, because it affords you extra attack power and movement opportunities. Moment to moment, The Banner Saga's skirmishes are much like those in similar battle systems, but a rock-solid interface and varied abilities that reward clever positioning keep the combat compelling, though it's rarely overtly challenging until you near the game's final hour."", ""Even more compelling is The Banner Saga's atmosphere. The colorful hand-drawn characters and cel-shaded villages would have been at home in a high-budget animated film. And the sight of your caravan stretching across the screen, with the yellow banner flying from an oxcart and the horned varl trudging wearily onward, reinforces the viciousness of the elements. An excellent soundtrack echoes the story's touchstones of personal sacrifice and stubbornness with discordant trumpets that sound out troubled fanfares, signaling heroism under duress. The Banner Saga is a beautiful game, filled with interesting ideas and enjoyable battles. It's too bad the story gets entangled within its own winding web, but this chilly journey does a fine job of reminding you that being a respectable leader is about more than just giving rousing speeches and schmoozing with the high and mighty.""]"Maxwell McGee,10-Jan-14,continue?9876543210 Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/continue-9876543210-review/1900-6415623/,7,PC,"[""Your time is over.

Even as a writer of words and a composer of music, I've long abandoned pencils, protractors, and manuscript pads in favor of word processing and electronic musicianship. In such a world, what is the value of simple paper and pen?"", ""The creators of Ballpoint Universe Infinite have found great value in those basic tools, crafting a surreal and striking world out of ballpoint ink strokes. Stepping into this universe is like waking in a Monty Python animation by way of Edwin Abbott Abbott's novella Flatland. You first interact with the game in the fashion of a 2D platformer, your own character depicted as a long-beaked creature in a smock--or, perhaps, a radish atop a tortilla chip atop two toothpicks. Or more specifically, a cutout of a doodle of a radish atop a tortilla chip atop two toothpicks. You move left and right with the kind of awkwardness you imagine such a being would move: loosely and haphazardly. The clumsiness is amplified by Ballpoint Universe's default mouse-only control scheme, which makes it all but impossible to perform precise jumps."", ""Fortunately, the game supports a controller, which makes it somewhat easier to navigate this weird and wonderful place. And Ballpoint Universe usually requires precision only as you near its close, though the scarcity of extended jumping sequences doesn't make those that exist any less untoward. You explore the campaign's overworld in this fashion, interacting with a cigar-chomping boot, a television wearing a ball cap who invites you to stare at him for a few hours, a floating cyclopic cephalopod, and a nerdy gatekeeper with a curious resemblance to comic strip character Dilbert."", ""These eccentrics live in a land that looks like the mad, marvelous ravings of a frustrated student manically scribbling the contents of his imagination during a particularly boring lecture. Columns, trees, and mechanical contraptions of unknown purpose have been scrawled on notebook paper and pasted onto the screen. Layered squares with drawings of skulls and skeletons depict the putrid soil underfoot. Thin lines snaking their way across ramps and walls recall the way ivy sprawls across brick facades. I wouldn't call this place beautiful, exactly, but it demands that you pay attention to it. I couldn't avert my eyes."", ""A universe is more than a planet, of course, and you spend most of your time playing Ballpoint Universe as a side-scrolling shooter, though Ballpoint Universe never approaches the kind of bullet hell associated with the genre. The imprecision of the platforming is evident in the shooting; it's hard to tell just how closely your asymmetrical craft can approach an enemy before colliding, or even when an object is a dangerous obstacle or a harmless bit of background. But just as the overworld rarely requires exactness, the space missions don't often test your twitch skills. Instead, they are more like raucous laboratories where you can try out different ship configurations to discover the most efficient ways of downing your foes."", ""Your ship's four customizable slots allow you to outfit all sorts of upgradable guns, shields, and swords. Indeed, your craft supports melee weapons that slice up nearby attackers automatically when they draw near. Melee weapons have different attack ranges and arcs, and much of the fun comes from discovering just how closely you can approach peril before your space-sword swipes it away. The blobs of ink that annihilated foes leave behind further prompt you to fly directly into danger: this is Ballpoint Universe's currency, and most of it evaporates away if you don't swoop in and suck it up. The variety of weapons is one of the game's best assets; there's enough diversity among the various weapons in terms of range, power, and behavior that missions rarely feel stale, even if you're facing enemies you've seen a few times before."", ""Those enemies are where Ballpoint Universe goes for broke. In one boss battle, an Elizabethan dandy with a ruffled collar and a pointy hat swings his sword and deflects your bullets, but this is no normal Elizabethan dandy with a ruffled collar and a pointy hat. No, this is a bizarre Shakespearean monster with its mirror image attached at the torso, as if someone had cut the figure of a king from a playing card and given him a massive shield and accordion arms. Your first encounters with this behemoth and others aren't that difficult, but they can become tedious; before you bedeck your ship with upper-tier weapons, Shakespeare and friends are predictable bullet sponges that take forever to give up the ghost."", 'These eccentrics live in a land that looks like the mad, marvelous ravings of a frustrated student manically scribbling the contents of his imagination.', ""The resulting multi-minute slog isn't very fun, but such tedium is limited to the early bosses, when you can afford only the dinkiest weapons. Even so, the initial stretches are still entertaining, with you weaving around enemy fire and swooping in close to intricately drawn angels of death so that your chainsword can soften their stings. Ultimately, you earn enough ink to power quite a ways through Infinite mode and its ceaseless waves of drifting deviants, and while Ballpoint Universe doesn't feature the tightly controlled battles that characterize the finest shoot-'em-ups, its imaginative visuals and satisfying customization options are compelling driving forces."", ""I'd never visited a universe quite like this one, where polygonal beings called logicians resemble geometry problems snipped from a mathematics textbook. There's a consistency to Ballpoint Universe's inconsistent style: you wouldn't suspect that walking rubbish bins and sentient isosceles triangles would occupy the same lands, yet the hand-drawn squiggles are the ties that bind, keeping the game from devolving into an unappealing mess of random images and ideas. Its action isn't as sharp as its artfulness, yet Ballpoint Universe Infinite is too exuberant to ignore.""]"Tom Mc Shea,6-Jan-14,Terraria Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/terraria-review/1900-6415621/,9,PlayStation Vita,"[""An old man awaits at the entrance of a dungeon. Stricken by a mysterious curse, he urges you to return after the sun has set, to free him of the madness that has infected his body. So you spend the day amid the grassy splendor of Terraria, surveying caves, slaying rabbits and slimes, as the hours tick by. Once night has set, you return to the old man, to free him of his curse and reap whatever rewards he wishes to give you. It turns out that the little curse transformed the old man into a demonic skeleton, a hovering monstrosity that unleashes holy hell upon your poorly equipped explorer. The battle rages for 10 seconds, maybe 20 if you run away at the onset, and then you're left staring at your corpse and wondering how you could ever defeat such a beast."", ""But there's no reason to be deterred by such a thorough beating. Terraria uses an empowering sense of discovery to grab you, and that unrestrained freedom is a double-edged sword. Free to explore the untouched lands, you may happen upon a monster much more powerful than you, or you may find a chest filled with precious treasures. You're never sure where your travels will lead you, but your curiosity is always rewarded. You may gain knowledge, such as knowing not to talk to old men at night, or happen upon a cache of gold, which can be used to forge a powerful sword. It's a world bursting with possibilities. Terraria is an incredible adventure that continually excites your imagination with the endless secrets that await."", ""Terraria debuted on the PC almost two years ago, and I was worried how such a mouse-heavy game could make the transition to a traditional control scheme. After a little practice, my worries were thankfully banished. Movement works remarkably well on the Vita, which makes sense given that Terraria feels like a 2D platformer. Performing precise jumps and grappling up walls feel even better using an analog stick instead of keyboard keys, so there's joy in traversing the world that didn't exist before. However, movement isn't nearly as important as excavation, and that's where patience matters. No longer can you dig precisely with a mouse; instead, you use a stick. The game has two options, manual and smart, which have different strengths and weaknesses. If you're clearing a deep hole, smart is blunt and effective. If you need to focus on individual blocks, manual works fine. Unfortunately, your cursor is controlled by both the right stick and the back touchpad, and there's no way to disable the second scheme, so you do have to hold the Vita carefully lest you dig haphazardly."", 'Terraria is an incredible adventure that continually excites your imagination with the endless secrets that await.', ""Discovery is the essence of Terraria, but thankfully that doesn't extend to basic play concepts. The PC version struggled to communicate exactly what you were supposed to do in this expansive world, and though the Vita version doesn't spell out every detail, it does a great job of pushing you in the right direction. Shelter is the most pressing matter for a lone explorer. Chop down trees to gain wood, and then use that wood to build a house. Once you lay out the frame, you need doors and a chair to complete the requirements, and that's where you get your first hint at what makes Terraria so appealing. You're told to make a crafting table, and by standing near it, you can make the rest of the pieces to finish your house. And there are a lot more items you can craft beyond that. With a bevy of weapons and armor, clothes and decorations, there are tons of tools you can make that help you become a better explorer."", ""The items you can craft are clearly spelled out for you, so you're never unclear about what's possible. Once you acquire any of the plentiful materials strewn about the land, you learn how you can use them to craft something that could help you on the journey. Turn cobwebs into silk and then combine that with wood to make a bed. Melt silver nuggets into bars and then pound those into a shining suit at your anvil. By seeing exactly what items you can create, you're pushed to gather those materials as quickly as you can. You want that jungle hat, right? Well, you better find an underground jungle and gather spores if you want to sport that fine protective gear. An enticing cycle of hunting for materials followed by reaping a reward crops up in the early moments. Once you have golden armor and tools, you can venture further, which allows you to access even more powerful weapons."", ""Much of your time in Terraria is spent digging elaborate tunnels beneath the surface. It's there that the most precious resources are buried, so you grab some torches and try to fend off the skeletons and bats as you dig ever deeper down. It's a slow process that stays compelling for two important reasons. First, with so many secrets hidden below, you continually stumble upon exciting new areas. Maybe you land at a place filled with bioluminescent mushrooms that can be brewed into a handy potion, or find a makeshift house hiding a treasure chest. You never know, so you keep digging. Second, there's a puzzle element to digging successfully. When you chip away at rock in the deep end of a lake, you have to figure out how to manage your dwindling supply of oxygen while going further down. Or you may have to divert water toward smoldering lava to create obsidian. You're always planning the best possible route, while fending off enemies, which keeps you engaged during those solitary hours carving out earth."", ' ', ""Once you harvest enough gold to drape yourself in it, you may wonder where you're supposed to go next. Well, thankfully, there's a guide who can point you in the right direction. Building houses attracts non-player characters, and each has his or her own way to help you. The guide tells you that it's finally time to fight a boss, and even details how to summon it, which is a godsend if you're lost. If you have an explosive in your inventory, a blast-happy dude moves in who happily sells you dynamite and bombs. There's no way to know exactly what will lure more NPCs to your commune, so just experiment with everything possible. None of them are necessary to complete your adventure, but they are a handy resource when you're stumped. Just make sure you fortify your walls. You wouldn't want a goblin army killing your only friends."", ""Combat in Terraria is often simple. Killing slimes is more about positioning than deeper tactics, so most enemies serve as a distraction rather than a serious roadblock. Of course, you could play with permadeath if you want a real challenge, or lose all of your items upon every death, but such consequences were so severe for me that I didn't want to venture forth, which defeats the point of the game. The normal option is that you lose money when you die, which is a gentle scolding more than a serious setback."", ""Be prepared to die a lot when bosses make an appearance. Every battle is against a massive beast that dwarfs your feeble adventurer, so you have to be smart and well prepared if you're going to come out on top. If you collect enough shooting stars beforehand, you can craft mana crystals that let you use magic. It's much safer to shoot magical strikes from a distance than to get up close with your warhammer. Still, there are many different tactics to take out the various bosses. And, who knows, maybe you won't have a chance to plan out a strategy at all. The Eye of Cthulhu randomly appears once you've become powerful enough, and it's crazy to fight this flying beast while in a subterranean jungle. Always be prepared for a fight; you wouldn't want to lose your hard-earned money because you forgot your bow at your home base."", ""Terraria is a perfect fit on the Vita. Playing this adventure on a handheld is a huge bonus to a game that was already incredibly well made. Now you can mine for hellstone while sitting on the throne or on a bus, so you're always making up an excuse to play for five more minutes. But watch those minutes spiral into the thousands without you even realizing it. And once you go as far as you think you can, you unlock hard mode, and there are even more items to craft and bosses to defeat. Terraria includes the updates to the PC version, so there are lots more bosses, items, and even biomes than when the game was first released. It takes a special game to make you fully care about all the little activities you're taking part in while still keeping your eye on a faraway prize, and Terraria deftly balances those ideas.""]"Kevin VanOrd,3-Jan-14,9.03m Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/9-03m-review/1900-6415619/,5,PC,"[""The most lasting monument that will be built to honor me is likely to be a simple gravestone with my name and dates of birth and death etched into it. A tombstone is an enduring memorial, but it's also an impersonal one. It's difficult to express the wonder and the turmoil of a single human life with a single slab of granite and a bouquet of flowers resting at its base."", ""9.03m seeks--but ultimately fails--to honor memories in a way a simple monument cannot. It is an interactive memorial for the precious souls lost in 2011 when a powerful tsunami devastated Japan's eastern coast. It does not depict the lives of known victims, nor does it present a solemn list of names on which to pontificate. Instead, it leads you across a tranquil beach in first-person perspective, where glowing markers lead you to dark silhouettes that represent lives cut short. As you approach, the shadowy figures dissipate, replaced with precious items that embody the joy, the youth, and the love that were washed away in the destructive deluge. The first figure: a young boy who vanishes, and is then substituted with a soccer ball, which in turn erupts in a flash of luminous particles, leaving a butterfly that flutters ahead, guiding you to the next shadow."", ""This 10-minute journey uses emotionally manipulative audiovisuals to make its impact. The sky, the sand, the ocean, and even the sun are infused with an indigo hue, initially lulling you into a serene melancholy underscored by the hushed roar of waves lapping at the shore. A maudlin piano soundtrack creates momentary dissonance with suspended chords, then gives way to relaxed thirds--a simple, proven method of inviting quiet contemplation. Each cherished object you examine (a music box, an engagement ring, and so forth) brings to mind an individual who will never dream again, yet each butterfly seems to emblematize the victim's soul, the game implying in its cliched conclusion that the spirits of the lost live on."", 'You might call 9.03m a form of interactive poetry, though its final message is more ""Hallmark card"" than ""heartfelt eulogy."" It is undoubtedly committed to its manipulation; the gentle camera movements, glittering waves, and hazy visuals want to comfort you, to embrace you. And in some sense, 9.03 works, in the way a Thomas Kinkaide painting works, or a Stephenie Meyer novel works. It has a shallow allure that allows you to use words like ""pretty"" and ""pleasant"" to describe it. But the game\'s laudable sentiment is an empty facsimile of grief and hope, rather than an honest expression of those emotions. Just as a tombstone is too dry and solemn to properly commemorate the tumult of a human life, 9.03m is too hollow to be a respectful tribute, and never uses player interaction in any meaningful way.', ""9.03m thus has no more to offer than would a pretty landscape drawing dedicated to the tragedy's victims. It's hard to fault the developer's intentions, and I appreciate the game's tranquil color palette and its pensive atmosphere. In a different context, 9.03m might have been a lovely trifle--but the lives snuffed out in 2011, and the survivors that mourn them, deserve more than just a trifle.""]"Daniel Starkey,30-Dec-13,Violett Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/violett-review/1900-6415618/,7,PC,"[""In ways both fantastical and familiar, Violett weaves a yarn that snakes around you and pulls you in. This point-and-click adventure shoves its surreality and challenge to the forefront, announcing its intention to lure you into its twisted world and twist your brain into knots from the get-go. As the story grows, the game's mechanics wane, touching on possibilities Violett never fully exploits. Yet where the lead character's magical abilities never wholly blossom, the journey casts its own kind of spells on you. Push past the frustrating initial moments and prepare for a lovely and unusual tale."", ""The basic setup is one we've all heard before. A young, rebellious teen moves away from her school and her life in the city to an old haunted house in the middle of nowhere. It's a bit hackneyed, but it works as a solid foundation for the game's real draw: a mind-bending nightmare world filled with tough puzzles and inventive visuals."", ""Channeling some unholy fusion between all of the great surrealist artists as well as a healthy dose of Lewis Carroll, Violett opens with the eponymous teen looking around her room for something--anything--to do. She spots a glint through a hole in the baseboard and reaches in to find herself quickly transported to a visually stunning alternate world. The story is pretty bare-bones and is almost exclusively without words, instead relying on pictures, symbols, and facial expressions to communicate. Unfortunately, while that approach helps the already stellar visual presentation, Violett's first few moments are marred by a dedication to that minimalism."", ""After her transportation to this alternate dimension, Violett finds herself trapped inside a cage, and you, as the player, have some small degree of control over her surroundings. At first, she can't do much besides rock her cage back and forth, by means of you clicking and dragging the mouse to and fro. Unfortunately that requires some strange timing, and it took me about 10 minutes to get the hang of it. On the flip side, that awkward motion shows up only once more at the very end of the game. Coarse first impressions aside, this first scene is fantastic as a vertical slice of everything you need to learn to progress."", ""Once you've rattled your cage sufficiently, you briefly grab the hands of a fairy, also imprisoned, which grants you some basic telekinetic powers. From there, you can manipulate objects throughout the room, either by simply clicking on them or by clicking and dragging them in a specific direction to achieve a specific effect. If you're trying to manipulate an object in the wrong way or at the wrong time, Violett shakes her head and mumbles disapprovingly."", 'Scattered around the room are a few colored orbs that you can collect by clicking on them. They are hidden, though, and very carefully disguised by the environment. These are orbs of elemental power, and they act as a constant sort of Easter-egg hunt. Often there are four or five on any given screen, but figuring out exactly where they sit is a running puzzle that helps guide you to look around the room for clues as to your next objective. With this knowledge in hand, you have all you need to move on.', ""From there, things start to get really strange. The first room you come to after the introductory area features a demonic-looking teapot that never takes its one eye off of you. It's distinctly unnerving, but works well to set the creepy, absurdist tone. This room also tests the lessons you learned in the first room to make sure that you've got the hang of them. From there, you find an M.C. Escher-inspired hub of sorts that leads off to several other places, and the game proper begins. This is also the toughest part of the game, since you have several rooms that you must tackle with relatively little to guide you. The strangeness of the world and the obtuse rules it follows highlight Violett's nature as an outsider to this world. You don't understand it, because she doesn't, at least not yet. Regardless, this first hub and its connected rooms amount to the first few hours of gameplay, and they are stunningly hard. While some of that difficulty continues, after you start to get a decent grasp on the world, it isn't quite as alien or as hostile."", ""There's an overarching theme of escapism that steadily transitions to homesickness, much in the way that Alice's trip through the rabbit hole first seems like a fun romp before becoming more and more hostile. Here, though, the first few environments are remarkably unfriendly, whereas the later ones are wistful and lonely. Because there are no words or real cutscenes to help communicate the game's message, and there's a strong implication that this is Violett's escapist fantasy, it's hard to shake the feeling that this trip through the rabbit hole is reflective of Violett's own emotional state. Helping that interpretation along is the absolutely fantastic musical score. The music changes from room to room, helping to contextualize each major location in the game. Some rooms rely on pizzicato strings to imply that Violett is in danger; others shift into G minor chords to imply sadness and loneliness."", ""While the meat and potatoes of such simple games are the environments and the puzzles, Violett does have a few odd problems. First, while the colored orbs I mentioned earlier are useful in that they help encourage you to look around and closely examine the rooms, they don't have much utility beyond that. Later, Violett gains some other powers in addition to her telekinesis. It's sort of implied that the strength of those powers is related to how many orbs you've collected, but they don't change at all over time. Even if they did, those other powers are rarely used. Violett's ability to float, make plants grow, and finally encapsulate herself in a shield all seem like they'd be fantastically useful for navigating such a strange land, but they never come up in a story-critical context until the last few seconds of the game. Instead, they're used only to help collect pages of a diary left by an unknown stranger. These pages aren't critical, nor do they provide any hints to help the game along. They are entirely optional, though you often have to go to rather extreme lengths to collect them. I was left feeling that the game is unfinished, because these skills aren't used for anything interesting or vital."", ""Despite the oddly incomplete utilization of otherworldly psychic powers, and an insane difficulty curve, the emotional context goes a long way to helping Violett along. The steep curve is representative of Violett's own confusion, and the powers are her growing determination to escape this alternate world and return home. Violett is quiet and unassuming, but it steadily weaves a tale about childhood fears and desires with which we are all too familiar. Despite its surreal setting, it has a very personal touch that grounds it.""]"Jason Venter,30-Dec-13,Max: The Curse of Brotherhood Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/max-the-curse-of-brotherhood-review/1900-6415617/,6,Xbox One,"[""Sometimes being pretty matters when you're a video game, and Max: The Curse of Brotherhood demonstrates that point perfectly. It's a typical platformer, competent but largely unremarkable. Basic running and jumping sequences are supplemented by interesting puzzles and an unsurprising slew of collectibles, but none of it ever comes together in a way that makes a truly favorable impression. Until, that is, you stop to admire the gorgeous visuals. Suddenly, everything disappointing starts to feel a little better, and the good moments are that much more uplifting."", ""The basic premise, as revealed in attractive cutscenes featuring voice work that thankfully manages to avoid ever feeling obnoxious, is as follows: you are Max, an irritable boy who comes home to his annoying younger brother, Felix. Annoyed by the lad's rambunctious behavior, you read aloud the words of a spell designed to make such nuisances disappear. As in the film Labyrinth, those words take almost immediate effect. Your sibling disappears through a void, and you jump in after him as regret over your irresponsible actions takes hold. Just like that, you've embarked on a journey across a treacherous wilderness. Your destination is the wizard Mustachio's castle, and your only weapon is a magic marker."", ""The story is no Excalibur, even if at several points you do pull items from various stones with Arthurian flair, and his inadequate means of self-defense makes the humble Max easy to root for as you help him navigate a world that seems to view him as either a snack or a pincushion. Cutscenes also prod you forward with the unspoken reminder that Felix's only real crime was being a normal boy, one who now is in grave peril thanks to you and you alone. Its a time-tested story and the expressive characters are animated every bit as beautifully in the story sequences as they are elsewhere."", ""Max can crawl, run, walk, jump, and drag things, but that's the extent of his repertoire. He'd never get far without his precious writing utensil, which you must use liberally. Pressing and holding the right trigger suspends direct control of Max and brings up an image of the tool, which interacts with colorful pieces of the architecture at your direction. For instance, a dark-green node can extend to form a ledge, which you can then use as a foothold or sever from its base to produce a movable platform. An orange node betrays the presence of a stone column. The interactive pieces of nature have variable limits, signified by steadily draining supplies of ink. You must figure out how to make the most of each resource."", 'Cutscenes also prod you forward with the unspoken reminder that Felixs only real crime was being a normal boy.', ""As the game progresses, the marker gains additional abilities, and the solutions to puzzles gradually require additional steps. In later scenes, it sometimes feels as if you're playing a scribble simulator rather than a platformer. Levels typically consist of a series of open spaces wherein you must chain together a few environmental effects (for example, you might have to draw a vine and then direct a current of water so that Max launches at the proper angle to grab the plant life and swing across a chasm), and then you hop along a few more ledges or run along an unremarkable corridor to reach the next such challenge. The difficulty lies in figuring out what you're supposed to accomplish in those more interactive areas."", ""Max doesn't encounter a lot of enemies on his adventure, which is just as well. It's a pleasure to descend along a series of ledges protruding from the face of a roaring waterfall, admiring the lush foliage and figuring out how to reach the far side of each hazard. Checkpoint placement is typically generous, so that even a fall to your doom means short-lived frustration at worst. However, you come across numerous other situations that prove frustrating because they require quicker reflexes and more precise movement than the game readily facilitates. The worst such moments are chase sequences, which usually find Max fleeing from a giant troll or sliding along a series of crumbling ruins. If Max suddenly needs you to produce a ledge lest he tumble into an abyss, the marker often materializes in a location that is less than ideal for the task at hand. Hurriedly swinging it into position and then drawing a line in the desired pattern is not always a simple task, and sometimes the precise stroke that means the difference between sweet success and disappointing failure is difficult to discern."", 'The interactive pieces of nature have variable limits, signified by steadily draining supplies of ink.', ""No matter how beautiful Max: The Curse of Brotherhood is--and typically, it's very beautiful, with detailed plant life and pleasing light and shadow effects--the moments when you're forced to play through a particular scene several times because you didn't anticipate a surprise shift in the landscape are always unwelcome. Even when you know exactly what to do, you may come across instances where you have to make several attempts before Max jumps far enough and grabs a vine that he has barely a chance of reaching. It's all very doable in the end, especially with practice and patience, but sometimes the developers make you work harder for that elusive victory than is warranted."", ""Another concern is that the puzzles eventually wear thin because most of them become predictable. There's sporadic creativity in design for the campaign's full five to seven hours, such as when you have to figure your way around some nasty lightning bugs or some bomb-tossing goblins, but mostly you perform the same few rote activities with only slight variations. Aside from the aggravating chase scenes, a scavenger hunt for collectibles is your only respite. Max yanks hideous eyeballs from walls and ceilings that lie off the beaten path, and he gathers pieces of a cracked amulet. Each new stage offers a tally to let you know how many objects lurk within, and you can revisit areas if you miss something. However, doing so requires a repeat journey through a bunch of puzzles that lose much of their appeal once you know their solution."", ""Max: The Curse of Brotherhood benefits immensely from attractive art design, and that is supplemented by a variety of puzzles that are initially quite satisfying before finally wearing out their welcome near the end. Consider taking the plunge if you're itching to dive into another pretty platformer, but otherwise you're probably better off waiting for a different curse to come along."", ' ']"Miguel Concepcion,30-Dec-13,Halo: Spartan Assault Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/halo-spartan-assault-review/1900-6415616/,6,Xbox One,"[""With Halo: Spartan Assault, Microsoft can say that the Xbox One managed to have a Halo game out during the launch window. The bad news is that it's not Halo 5 or even another HD anniversary edition. Yet it's still a Halo game, which means it has a wealth of Covenant grunts to murder with your trusty needler. Spartan Assault reimagines Halo as a twin-stick shooter, delivering on much of the genre's arcade allure. However, the transition from mobile to consoles has brought with it a bevy of microtransactions, for better or worse. Mostly worse."", ""The non-numerical Halo games have been fitting avenues to explore other facets of the UNSC beyond Master Chief's exploits. Many of us were already familiar with SPARTAN-IV commander Sarah Palmer in Spartan Ops, and Spartan Assault makes her a playable character, along with Edward Davis, who appeared in the Halo: Initiation comics. Set after the war of the original trilogy but before Halo 4, the game finds Palmer, Davis, and other members of the UNSC faced with a Covenant invasion rather than a Promethean one. The setting maintains the Halo universe's curious aversion to normal astronomical objects; if it isn't a ring-shaped world, it's a hollow one. In Spartan Assault's case, the planet of Draetheus V is standard enough, but its moon, X50, isn't a moon but rather a planet-destroying Forerunner structure. Sound familiar?"", ""In making Spartan Assault a genuine Halo game, developers 343 Industries and Vanguard Entertainment did away with one of the common comforts of many twin-stick shooters: unlimited ammo. It makes for a mild challenge in ammo conservation, until you realize how often fallen foes drop weapons for you to capitalize on. I give Spartan Assault credit for punishing complacency. The ease of the initial levels, along with their bite-size play lengths, makes it tempting to charge into the fray without taking advantage of the environment and the items in the field. Dying at the hands of the occasional wraith or grenade barrage encourages you to strategize. It's most rewarding when you have the presence of mind to know your ammo count and the cooldown time of your current armor ability, vanquishing foes using your mind as much as your might."", ""As I progressed through the game's first few missions, I was motivated to try out every familiar Halo weapon and see how they worked in this game's elevated camera view. The USMC rifles are reliable as expected, as is the target-tracking ammo of the sadistic needler. I was especially fond of dual-wielding a pair of SMGs, guns known for their inaccuracy in first-person Halo games, but their bullet-spreading tendencies worked great against the agile buggers in Spartan Assault."", ""The iconic Warthog and the free-flying Banshee are nowhere to be found, though more puzzling is the inability to wield an energy sword--not to mention, the ability to withstand three energy sword hits in quick succession. And don't even bother trying to hijack an occupied Covenant Ghost; you're better off taking it down with a plasma grenade instead of risking a fatal collision and restarting the level."", ""Halo vets will recognize the many objectives of Spartan Assault, which skew toward killing in general and focus less on activating switches. The more tense assignments are timed survival missions requiring you and your squad to last three to five minutes. Taken one at a time, these missions satisfy the need for short sessions, though in the scope of the overall game, tearing through Spartan Assault's 35 sorties makes for a playthrough that shouldn't take longer than five hours."", ""Acknowledging the double-dip of porting Spartan Assault on the Xbox One, Microsoft is offering a 66 percent discount to fans who have previously purchased the game for Windows 8 devices. An equally attractive incentive is the introduction of co-op play in five new missions featuring the much-loathed Flood. These levels, with their turnkey switches and their laser turrets that benefit from two operators, are designed with two players in mind. The Flood's penchant for overwhelming Spartans gives this mode a brief Smash TV-inspired rush that the campaign lacks. These new assignments can all be cleared in less than an hour--and they underscore by the lack of couch co-op and the campaign's total lack of co-op."", ""The entire game can be completed without spending real money or even the experience points you earn after each mission. However, even though success is possible, the game does place artificial constraints on you, encouraging you to spend some credits. I have always enjoyed the one-hit-kill prowess of a sniper rifle in any shooter, and it's disappointing that, aside from a couple of missions, the only way to access such a weapon in Spartan Assault is by spending cash or XP. Then again, I still managed to get my instant-kill fix through the classic Halo magnum."", ""Greatly disappointing is the lack of permanent ownership of Spartan Assault's purchased enhancements, since you don't get to keep these items after using them in a mission. The only reason to get into in-app purchases is to use various boosts and assists to get gold stars for scoring well. Spartan Assault should have succeeded in being a competitive arcade game by the classic definition, one where you strive to beat your friends' high scores, but victory rings hollow when you can buy your way to the top. Trial and error is needed to figure out which single-use armor abilities and boosts work best in getting the most points in a given mission, so Spartan Assault is best suited for Halo fans with high tolerances for repetition."", ""Whether you're hurriedly exiting a Scorpion tank on its last legs or backpedaling away from a gravity-hammer-wielding Brute, Spartan Assault is not short of familiar, albeit select, Halo moments. In-app purchases do not intrude on Spartan Assault's overall appeal, though the selection of optional items is only of interest if you seek to improve your scores. The limitation on cooperative play is the game's biggest disappointment, so here's hoping that Microsoft Studios has more multiplayer levels in mind for possible downloadable content.""]"Britton Peele,30-Dec-13,flOw Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/flow-review/1900-6415615/,7,PS4,"[""There's a beauty to Flow that's unique, more than half a decade after it became popular with its release on the PlayStation 3. Its simple visuals and simple music combine with even simpler gameplay to make for an experience that's trancelike in nature, requiring little from you but offering a lot in return. Flow has since been eclipsed by the developer's more recent games--Flower and Journey--which fill a similar niche while improving on its core ideas. Yet Flow is as magical now as it was then, even if the magic doesn't last very long."", ""Flow might remind you of looking at bacteria under a microscope, though the visuals are more conventionally beautiful. Organisms swim around on a 2D plane you are looking down into, with larger creatures eating the smaller ones. These fishlike beings (similar to aquatic life such as eels and jellyfish) float against a simple watery background, providing a a beautiful combination of shapes both complex and simple, while floating particles add texture to the environment. A subtle blurring effect shows you what's below the layer of ocean you're on, giving you a good impression of depth even when you can swim in only two dimensions."", ""You control various creatures, one at a time, across various stages. Each stage plays out the same way: you begin small, you eat smaller creatures to grow bigger and evolve, and you attack bigger creatures until you can eat them, too. The world is divided into two-dimensional layers, with you swimming deeper and deeper down to progress. If you're like me, you will feel a natural desire to devour each and every living thing on your way down to the bottom, but nothing forces you to. There are no meters or time limits to worry about. Your pace is entirely your own."", ""You move almost entirely by tilting the controller in the direction you want to swim, occasionally hitting a button to perform a creature-specific action. The game's single-screen instructions (Flow's only instance of direction or assistance) say a button press gives you a boost, but this is not always the case. You might do something else, such as spin, and finding each creature's unique characteristic is part of what keeps you playing. Since each creature has the same goal (eat, evolve, and dive deeper) and each layer of water is visually similar to the last, the different abilities are your only real change of pace in the short amount of time it takes you to reach the credits."", 'The aesthetic walks an impressive line between simple and complex.', ""The only time Flow has anything remotely close to a challenge is when you go up against a creature of equal or greater size than yourself. The ensuing fight could have you tilting the controller more frantically in an effort to attack the enemy's weak points as it moves, but even this doesn't carry with it a threat of death or lost progress. There is no fear of losing; if you find yourself beaten by a creature bigger than yourself, you are merely sent up to a safer layer of water where you can recover."", ""While Flow does have an end, the journey is more important than the destination. The visuals and the music have a Zen-like quality to them, and the simplicity of tilting the controller makes for an almost meditative state throughout the game. While the actions you're performing could be seen as violent (considering everything boils down to one creature eating countless others), the experience feels more like a gentle float down a lazy river than a frantic swim through shark-infested waters, even during the most frantic fights. A friend or three can jump in at any time, but nothing is added to the experience, and, in fact, it's more placid alone. Flow is more of an art piece to be quietly admired than a challenge to be overcome with company."", ""Since there's nothing especially technical about how Flow looks or plays, it benefits little from the upgrade to PlayStation 4 hardware. It does run better, avoiding the occasional frame-rate hiccups seen on the PS3, and it's still beautiful and unique, though no more beautiful than before. If you bought the PS3 version, Flow is available to you free via Sony's cross-buy program and warrants a re-play, if only through the lend of the developer's later experiments in interactive tranquility."", ""Flow has adapted well to the PS4 ecosystem and holds up remarkably well, though it is neither as serene as Flower or as touching as Journey. Nevertheless, Flow is obviously the common DNA those beauties share. If you have somehow found yourself in a situation where you can try only one Thatgamecompany experience, this probably isn't it. But if you want a cool, oddly relaxing experience, Flow is still remarkably unique years after it first came out.""]"Kevin VanOrd,20-Dec-13,X Rebirth Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/x-rebirth-review/1900-6415614/,2,PC,"[""Einstein taught us that space is both homogeneous and isotropic--that is, on a large scale, the universe is smooth and uniform in all directions. It's empty out there. Like many space games before it, X Rebirth depicts an unrealistically vibrant universe bursting with color and texture, and that's as it should be. A near-vacuum makes a dreary backdrop for a video game, at least for a human observer."", ""It isn't X Rebirth's inauthentic view of space that should anger you; it's that this sequel is a galactic collision of unparalleled scale, an interstellar parade of bad ideas badly executed. Just as the observable universe has no center, neither does space exploration game X Rebirth find a foundation from which to grow outward, and I am unsure how to begin describing its failures. I can only begin at the quantum level, pulling out each particle and analyzing its deficiencies. And so I start in the cockpit, where most galactic adventures begin."", ""The Albion Skunk is the aptly named vessel that carries you on this journey. Unless you're peering out of a space port's window or piloting one of the game's different drones, you always see space through the Skunk's front window, and overlooking the aesthetically dull control panel that tells you the ship's condition. In fact, you look at most of X Rebirth's menus in the cockpit, each list pulling up on a digital display viewable by both you the player and protagonist pilot Ren Otani."", ""This menu integration might have been a sensible way to draw you further into this universe, but no amount of immersion would have been enough to veil the system's grave deficiencies. Pulling up so much as a simple galactic map requires a ridiculous number of keystrokes, with each submenu buffered by just enough input lag and unnecessary animation to cause impatience. Furthermore, the menu doesn't always take up a sensible portion of the screen, making it hard to read intricate mission objectives--and even harder to read them when a particularly garish spacescape shines from behind the Skunk's menu screen."", 'Garish spacescapes are common in X Rebirth, though there are sights of real beauty. Ships feature a remarkable amount of detail, and space stations and capital ships catch the eye with their intricate industrial designs. Rushing between systems via the game\'s space highways can be a visual delight, particularly as you watch ships and structures approach and then race by. When the color scheme embraces tranquil blues and developer Egosoft exercises visual restraint, the hazy background nebulae and tumbling asteroids are a treat. All too often, however, the view erupts with harsh orange and turquoise hues, making you wonder if you shouldn\'t stock the Albion Skunk with sunscreen. A vibrant vision of space is typically pleasing enough, but X Rebirth\'s depiction occasionally surpasses ""meticulous"" and surges straight into ""gaudy.""', ""Buy low and sell high. It's a solid economic policy, and it forms the backbone of X Rebirth's explore-fight-collect-build gameplay loop. It's an inviting loop, and I found myself pushing onward to collect enough funds, hiring enough ships to join my squad, and building enough structures in the hope of calling the result a true empire."", ""Sometimes, doing so means shooting spacecraft piloted by members of the slave-trading Plutarch Mining Corporation. Combat is functional, but ship controls are loose, though I never felt as though I wasn't properly directing the action. Regardless, the Skunk is your only ride for the duration, so get used to the way it looks and feels, though you can improve its performance with enhanced weaponry, shields, and so forth. Fortunately, you will build up an entire squad of vessels that perform various vital actions on your behalf, assisting you in combat, erecting structures, and ferrying goods about the sector. Massive battles are visually explosive, momentarily interrupting the slow-paced trading with fiery combat."", 'This sequel is a galactic collision of unparalleled scale, an interstellar parade of bad ideas badly executed.', ""And boy is trading slow-paced. Buying and selling goods isn't an immediate process, or even an efficient one. Instead, you must wait for many minutes on end as your sluggish trading ship edges ever closer to the trade port, giving you an opportunity to poke around the sector, or more likely, to go grab a glass of wine and peruse the latest issue of Science Magazine from cover to cover. You also must maintain fuel reserves, which can come as a shock the first time a hired pilot informs you of his fuel shortage over the comm and has you scrambling to figure out how to rectify the situation, given how ordering your ship to fuel up is not an option you can find in the game's menus."", 'Building up a fleet takes time and money, and you don\'t find capable crew members free-floating in space, but rather within space stations, which you explore on foot after docking. First-person exploration could have been a grand addition, taking the X series that much closer to the everything-and-the-kitchen-sink games developer Derek Smart wanted his Battlecruiser series to be, but never was. It soon becomes obvious, however, that traversing cookie-cutter stations sucks the mystery out of space travel, leaving behind horrifying human visages that spout absolute drivel in the most excruciating tone of voice imaginable. You see the same grotesquely scarred faces over and over again, and engaging one of these unblinking ghouls results in absolute nonsense. Any given conversation is utterly devoid of logic. Characters are routinely rude when you approach them, then become delighted, and then lapse into obnoxiousness again. In the meanwhile, female characters frequently whine ""Ew! Slimy green lizard things are everywhere!"" in the shrillest possible manner, as if they are 1950s housewives from classic cartoons, crying atop the kitchen table and swatting at pesky mice.', ""That line is shrieked in regard to the reptilian Teladi race, whose existence in the X universe is well established. Perhaps Egosoft wanted to use first-person exploration to further develop the game's tone and deepen its lore. Sadly, a universe full of rude, moronic space travelers barely capable of communicating normal thoughts in a logical order is not a compelling place to be."", ""Instead, having to dock at a station and walk around looking for the right merchants becomes a chore. My first foray into a station delighted me; I could loot lockers and crates for marketable items, leading me to believe that X Rebirth might spill into role-playing territory. Alas, clicking on lockers becomes monotonous busywork, as does roaming the cut-and-paste hallways looking for vendors and crew members for hire. These places are as lifeless as a white dwarf, even in their underpopulated lounges, each living statue stiffly waiting for you to click on it. Characters speak of their own accord only when prompting you to take part in a ridiculous-beyond-measure minigame in which you engage in surreal small talk to earn a few discounts. It wasn't long before I avoided this minigame altogether, however: no matter how deep the discount, I couldn't stomach the stupid dialogue, which made me question how such imbeciles could have devised any form of space travel."", ""It isn't just in the space stations where you go hunting for discounts. Out in the black beyond, you glimpse icons that urge you to investigate the objects they identify; examine enough of them, and you unlock discounts and side missions. Little lowercase i's are splattered all over the place, but you have to be close enough to see them, and you must have line of sight. And thus your adventure turns into a vapid Easter egg hunt in which you float around satellite arrays seeking icons, and then soar close enough to them to interact with them. It isn't uncommon to briefly see an icon identifying a side mission only to have it flicker away in a flash, forcing you to maneuver carefully around the starbase hoping to catch another glimpse."", ""Don't expect those missions to work properly once you graciously accept them from your sneering contacts, however. Each X game has suffered from a certain number of rough edges at launch, and you could be forgiven for assuming that like those games, X Rebirth would be superficially glitchy but eminently playable. Yet no matter how low your expectations might be for the newest X's stability, the game still manages to sink lower. Only a few hours in, and a mission proved impossible to complete, leading me to commiserate with other players suffering from the same game-ending bug in Internet forums. After downloading a saved game file from a helpful comrade, I continued my journey, only to have a side mission task me with destroying a story-critical capital ship, leaving me to wander for hours wondering why I couldn't find my mission objective."", 'A universe full of rude, moronic space travelers barely capable of communicating normal thoughts in a logical order is not a compelling place to be.', 'Listing all of the bugs I encountered would take up inordinate amounts of space, and so I offer here a random array. Crashes too numerous to count. Poor frame rates that had me wondering why I\'d spent so much money on modern computer hardware. Suddenly unresponsive dialogue that left me stuck mid-conversation. Enemy ships flying around in the middle of space station geometry, keeping me from completing missions. Trading ships that simply wouldn\'t conduct the assigned transaction. That last one was particularly aggravating, considering how much time you must wait for functional transactions to complete. All too often, X Rebirth had me asking the age-old question: ""Is it a bug or a feature?""', ""The fact that it's too difficult to tell the difference tells you all you must know about X Rebirth. You might assume a bright future for the game, given Egosoft's solid history of supporting its games after release--and given the community's dedication to crafting fixes and modifications that further improve these starry treks. X Rebirth's failings are rooted too deeply to simply be patched away, however. No matter what your level of enthusiasm for the X series is, do your best to escape the pull of Rebirth's gravity. It's only bound to cause a fatal crash.""]"Leif Johnson,20-Dec-13,State of Decay Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/state-of-decay-breakdown-review/1900-6415611/,7,Xbox 360,"['State of Decay: Breakdown raises an important question: does downloadable content still count as content when it takes out more content than it adds? After all, this is still Trumbull Valley as we left it back in June, but here there are no squabbles with military hard-asses or heroic attempts to overcome blocked mountain passages. This, rather, is a bleak scramble for survival, and one in which the zombies are all but guaranteed to win.', ""In short, it's the sandbox so many of us wanted back in the early days of summer. Though bootable as a separate experience from the main narrative, it's meant to address the perception that there was little left to do once the trajectory of the story cut off progression, and thus the potential for replay, aside from milking the last save file. But this addition, priced at almost half the cost of the full game, adds no new enemies or locations; instead, it guts the story completely aside from side missions."", 'This, rather, is a bleak scramble for survival, and one in which the zombies are all but guaranteed to win.', 'Breakdown is an apt title. The core experience involves the usual business of fortifying communities and scrounging for supplies, but it also throws in the need to repair a busted RV and to select five survivors to take along on the most awkward road trip of all time. Alas, it\'s a road trip to nowhere, because ""escape"" leads you back to the same town, but the circumstances grow direr upon each visit. You may start in a random location at a higher level than in the previous playthrough and with the buddies you brought along, but cars become more scarce, zombies become stronger and more numerous, and resources don\'t respawn. It\'s a Sisyphean vision of hell, and one where success is rewarded with misery. Repeat it long enough, and survival seems less and less likely.', ""The goal, simply, is to survive as long as possible. I'm currently sitting at the seventh difficulty level out of 10, and already I've reached the point where I'm about ready to take up the undead on their pushy invitations to join their numbers. It has taken many hours to reach this point, and in the process, the brutal difficulty has forced a welcome adoption of different tactics that were only toyed with in the core narrative. Firecrackers, mines, and Molotov cocktails become more valuable than standard weapons, for instance, and firing a gun has such horrifying consequences that I tried to avoid firing one altogether. By the fourth difficulty tier, even cars are weak, which means no more joyrides where you mow zombies down like grass."", ""It's a Sisyphean vision of hell, and one where success is rewarded with misery."", ""Admittedly, it could have been harder. The repetition involved with each new cycle turns you into a Trumbull Valley native rather than a tourist, and as a result, you start new playthroughs knowing the locations of essential sites such as grocery stores, police stations, and pharmacies. The locations of survivors and safe houses may change with each playthrough, but the familiarity with the rest of State of Decay's elements allows some room for hope. And if you die? Breakdown at least has the decency to start you back at the same level rather than forcing you to relive the experience again."", 'So what\'s new here? Not much, aside from the hefty batch of new ""heroes"" you find scattered among the existing cast of characters, although their specialized professions, such as paramedic and soldier, make them ideal for the privileged seats in your RV. If there\'s a problem, it\'s that most of the requisites to unlock them lead to hours of mindless grinding. Take the dealer: if you want him and his godly ability to send you a car whenever you need one (at the cost of influence), you have to slaughter 400 zombies with nothing more than your car door.', ""But beyond that, this is the same State of Decay I already knew and largely love. It's a shame, then, that this means it's also susceptible to many of the same bugs and glitches. Zombies still tend to walk through walls with all the nonchalance of Casper, storage containers claim to be full even when they're empty, and companions sometimes insist on taking leisurely strolls even when the zombie hordes are charging in plain sight."", ""Breakdown is thus the kind of DLC that probably should have been in the game in the first place. Seven bucks is a steep price to pay for what amounts to a shake-up of the original adventure, although to its credit, it delivers a satisfyingly harrowing experience for players who didn't find sufficient challenges the first time around. Indeed, in its best moments, it achieves a commendable expression of what an open-world survival experience should be. Every scrap of building material becomes precious, and items such as morphine assume the veneration once accorded to religious relics. And with around 10 hours needed to pick each cycle clean, there's plenty to do.

NES Remix serves up a bunch of bite-size moments from Nintendo Entertainment System games, and if you played and loved those games when you were younger, those positive associations can make playing these nuggets a warm, fuzzy experience. But if you don't bring that nostalgic context to NES Remix yourself, playing the game will feel like looking at a stranger's cherished family photos."", ""The Legend of Zelda is an enduring classic, one of the greatest and most important games of all time. In NES Remix, you relive many iconic moments from it. Your first task is simply to walk into the cave on the screen where the game begins and collect the sword from the old man who tells you that it's dangerous to go alone. Grab the sword and the objective is done; you're then whisked off to a screen infested with octoroks that you must slay. Then you restore your health at a rejuvenating pool, buy an item from a merchant, and enter a dungeon. If your memory can fill in the gaps in the experience, it can stir up some feelings of what it was like to embark on the game's heroic quest for the first time. But on their own, these objectives aren't interesting, and the disjointed way in which they're cut out of the full game and presented without context means that anyone who hasn't already played The Legend of Zelda won't come away with any understanding of what makes this game so extraordinary."", ""The same can be said of NES Remix's handling of Super Mario Bros. For lifelong fans like me, stomping a goomba on World 1-1 is enough to fill my heart with nostalgic warmth. But it's only because I have memories of many happy childhood hours spent running and leaping through the game's eight worlds that such moments have this effect on me. Because I didn't play Clu Clu Land as a kid, I didn't feel drawn to the snippets of it that are included in NES Remix. And in the case of Ice Climbers, a game I enjoyed as a child, playing it here was frustrating; as an indiscriminating youngster, it never occurred to me how much of that game's difficulty results from your character's strange, irritating jumping arc."", 'In addition to gameplay challenges that are lifted right out of classic and not-so-classic NES games, there are ""remix"" stages that change things up in some way. A few are endless runner-style stages that have Mario running automatically through stages from Super Mario Bros, and your only focus is making sure he leaps over hazards and avoids enemies. Some are stages from Donkey Kong, but they replace Mario with Link, who cannot jump, which makes avoiding barrels and rescuing Pauline much more difficult. But most of the remix stages aren\'t all that clever. One has you playing Mario Bros. upside down. Others shroud stages from Donkey Kong or Donkey Kong Jr. in darkness, an interesting visual twist that doesn\'t actually make playing through those levels much more difficult.', ""At $15, NES Remix is a pricey piece of packaged nostalgia.

I was curious about this because when I started Strength of the Sword 3, it felt like it had expected me to come in already knowing gameplay nuances and mechanics from the previous two games...only those two games didn\'t exist.', ""The game has a simple premise, presented in a charming little animated intro scene: a monstrous horde is invading the land, and a golem warrior has been delivered to stem the advancing tide of foul creatures and restore whatever harmony was there before. But even the most heaven-sent of warriors needs divine patience to make it through combat with these hellish hordes. Strength of the Sword 3 is an incredibly challenging game, with enemy battles that require you to make use of all the resources and skills available to you in order to win. Difficulty settings? Forget 'em; the game has one setting, and that setting is murderously tough."", ""Strength of the Sword 3 doesn't have levels as much as it has collected sets of enemy encounters.

The environments are arena-like, with no exits or safe spaces to flee to: you either defeat your opponents or die trying. And die you will, many times, because damage is high and the game's forgiveness is very, very low. The AI in Strength of the Sword 3 is impressive; the creatures you fight react to your movements and attacks with surprising defensive and aggressive acumen. You certainly can't spam special attacks and expect to win, because the monsters will counter your attacks and retaliate with a vengeance. The only way to survive is to learn your skills, learn your enemies' skills, and figure out how to use your abilities to counteract theirs--a process that requires lots of trial and error. Strength of the Sword 3 isn't a long game, but it takes lots of retries to finish."", ""Fortunately for your fighter, Strength of the Sword 3 features a robust combat system.

Some of the controls are a bit odd, like having dodge and dash tied to the same button. The game has a list of moves you can look up at any time, but there\'s no place to get the hang of the controls outside of actual combat. Some of the early stages give you a list of skills to try, and tell you if you perform their inputs correctly, but they don\'t bother to show how or why the skills are useful. It\'s tough to learn when you should use skills like the running dash and the shield bash when you are interrupted or immediately punished after merely trying them. While the lack of hand-holding is nice, it\'s frustrating to be thrown into the hottest flames of battle from the get-go. Since you can\'t learn by doing, and it\'s difficult to figure out organically through play, you may feel like you want to give up early on. This is why I was surprised that no previous games in the ""series"" existed--the game seemed to assume I already knew what I was doing!', ""Another major issue with Strength of the Sword 3 is that the enemies you fight aren't that interesting. Think of some of the most memorable boss encounters in challenging games like Dark Souls, how intimidating and awesome the foes looked and how their attacks and skills filled you with dread and awe. Strength of the Sword 3's enemies are certainly tough, but they don't look or feel the part in their appearance or their attacks: you fight a cartoony goblin or an orc-type creature one fight, only to fight something that looks pretty similar in the next fight, but hey, this one flies! While there's certainly charm to the game's cartoony visual style, the fights lack the sort of spectacle and clever gimmickry you would want in such a combat-focused game."", 'There are a few more irritations: the tendency of the game to go into ""helpful"" (but really not) slow motion when you are struck, occasional camera bugs, and the wholly unpleasant experience of getting trapped in corners of the arena while enemies simply go to town on you (though getting stuck there is usually your own fault). But these are occasional occurrences that can be overlooked to some extent; the steep learning curve and the boring enemy design are much harder to forgive.

The term carries some negative connotations, since it\'s generally presumed that the quality of the game itself will be subpar compared to its non-licensed peers. But as kids who grew up with classic series reach adulthood and get jobs developing games themselves, there have been marked improvements in kyara-ge: when you have genuine affection for a licensed franchise, you feel a lot more invested in the quality of the product. It\'s still exceptionally rare to find kyara-ge on the level of something like Batman: Arkham City, but these games are often at least mildly enjoyable--a category that Saint Seiya: Brave Soldiers falls into nicely.', ""Saint Seiya: Brave Soldiers is a one-on-one 3D fighting game based on Saint Seiya, a Japanese anime and manga franchise that began in the mid-'80s. Many kids growing up around that time period, especially from France, Italy, and Latin America, have fond memories of Knights of the Zodiac, which had a following comparable to that of The Transformers or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in North America. Previous Saint Seiya games have actually been localized and released in several of these territories--including a Warriors-style PlayStation 3 action game--but this is the first time Namco Bandai games has released a Saint Seiya game in English."", ""Brave Soldiers developer Dimps is no stranger to anime-themed fighting games, having also worked on numerous Dragonball Z games. It knows well what fans expect out of this sort of game: true-to-the-source visuals, a story mode, online and offline versus, and a whole mess of unlockable characters, collectibles, and extras. Brave Soldiers delivers on all these fronts: there's a very lengthy story mode that covers multiple arcs of the anime/manga plot, a gigantic roster of characters (over 50, with up to 15 variations for each), character variants to use, beneficial items to customize your fighters with, and a massive gallery filled with art, music, and a staggering number of images and info about Japanese Saint Seiya toys and collectible cards. If you want to unlock everything the game has to offer, Brave Soldiers is going to keep you busy for quite some time. However, you're going to have to actually want to unlock everything, which entails either being a preexisting Saint Seiya fan, becoming a fan through playing the game, or enjoying the gameplay enough to want to play over and over again. This is where problems start to arise."", ""The biggest issue is that Brave Soldiers' fighting engine is noticeably shallow. Every character has strong and weak attacks that can be chained together for basic combos, a basic jump/dash maneuver, and throws. Stronger strikes, special attacks, and homing maneuvers can be performed at the cost of your cosmo meter, which builds up on landing and receiving attacks but can also be charged up manually. A hugely damaging big bang attack can be executed using three full cosmo bars, resulting in an impressively animated attack sequence that expertly showcases the fantastical, melodramatic fighting attacks of the source material. Another gauge, the seventh sense meter, builds up over time and can be triggered when full, giving the character that triggers it a power boost. Combat is pretty easy to get the hang of, but there isn't much in the way of depth: don't expect many advanced combos or strategies here. It's fun to assault foes with special skills and big bang attacks, but the luster wears off as time rolls on."", ""And time does roll on, especially if you're going through the game's story mode.

Don't expect things to make much sense unless you're already familiar with the franchise, because a good chunk of the story is skipped over to drop the heroes smack-dab in the midst of the Sanctuary arc's temple fights. I had a passing knowledge of Saint Seiya, but I required someone who was a longtime series fan to watch me play through parts of the story mode and explain elements that were omitted or glossed over before things even began to make sense."", ""The presentation doesn't do much to help, either: dialogue between characters is presented with still heads above dialogue boxes, and rather than rendering the more dramatic twists and turns of these epic fights with cinematics (or having you play them), the game simply presents them as touched-up screenshots lifted from the original anime series. The voice-over is in Japanese with English text, and the translation is lacking, with some odd text display choices (not fitting all of a character's spoken dialogue into a single box, for example) and stilted, awkward exchanges that fail to capture the excitement of a bunch of hyper-powered, extremely pretty armored anime men beating the ever-loving crap out of each other. If you don't know much about Saint Seiya, the story mode won't make you a fan, and if you do, you might still be disappointed in some of the ways it's presented."", 'The CPU fights are also a slog. On the standard difficulty, the computer is downright brain-dead, falling for simple tricks and repeated attacks, all while choreographing special attacks in such a way that makes them incredibly easy to dodge. Battles typically devolve into using the ""dodge behind foe"" skill when taking damage to interrupt foes and start your own combos, and then running away, charging up, and spamming super skills until somebody tries to get in close and the whole process repeats again There are some fun dialogue exchanges between the fighters during battle, but it\'s hard to read the subtitles in the midst of a fight. Even worse is that, for story reasons, some fights have to be repeated multiple times before chapters are cleared. Since all of the interesting fight elements occur in text outside of the fights, the CPU combat feels all the more unexciting.', ""Fights against human foes are considerably more fun, simplistic as they are. You can use characters and variants you've unlocked through story mode, as well as customize your characters with status-augmenting orbs you can purchase with currency earned in-game. Online play supports both player and ranked matches, and features fully functional lobbies for the latter. The game features a staggering number of character and costume choices, many of which are unlocked in-game, though there is plenty of downloadable content for devoted Saint Seiya fans to download and add to their collections."", ""There's no denying that Saint Seiya has had more effort put into it than a run-of-the-mill licensed anime game. It expertly captures the look and feel of the '80s anime, and gives fans the means to feel like they are in control of a hyper-powered character launching all manner of crazy attacks. And once you've got a fair number of characters unlocked, you can have simplistic fun going up against other players. But with its limited depth, Brave Soldiers can't hold its own against more technical fighters on the market, and the tedium and lackluster presentation of the story mode won't give anyone who's not already a fan of the series much of a reason to become one. But if you were one of those kids who grew up with this series--or perhaps discovered it many years later when the English editions finally began rolling out in the early aughts--then you'll find a lot of nice fan service to enjoy here.

Adewale is now ready to forge own path, though Freedom Cry is just a small window into Adewale's solo exploits; we don't bear witness to his initiation into the Brotherhood, and this downloadable content merely teases us with a Templar pursuit in its opening minutes, which quickly goes awry in a storm."", ""If this stormy start rings a bell, it's because it curiously mirrors the beginning of Black Flag, except now it's Adewale lying on a beach in the West Indies with a mystery package from the Templars. While he's eager to resume his mission, his detour in tracking the package's recipient leads him to Bastienne, a madam in Port-au-Prince. Given Adewale's firsthand experience as a slave and his inherent sense of justice, his interests in freeing the local slaves align with the madam's. Considering Bastienne's association with the Templars, their alliance is a tenuous one, which is further complicated when they don't see eye to eye on how to best initiate a rebellion."", ""Whereas Black Flag merely touched upon the plight of slaves in the New World, slavery is the main thematic thrust of Freedom Cry. The center of Port-au-Prince provides limitless opportunities to steal keys to open cages and end human auctions stealthily or brutally. Echoing a scene in Black Flag where Kenway is carrying a dying character, Adewale has opportunities to carry poor injured slaves to hideaways in the jungle. It's infinite slave spawning as designed, and given your obligations to the main story quests, the perpetual influx of slaves is a blunt allegory about how freeing such captives isn't a task for one man, let alone one assassin. Yet when you start seeing runaway slaves pop up from the same spots and chased along the same paths repeatedly, these respawns bring out the game's monotony. Moreover, there's no penalty for ignoring these rescue missions aside from missing out on bonus items. It feels mildly twisted that slaves are still treated as a commodity even after you set them free. The more you liberate, the greater the access to optional enhancements, such as more ammo pouches and a steel-forged machete. The story justifies this with exposition that shows the freed slaves are working toward your cause and giving you resources to free others. That doesn't change the discomforting fact that these humans have been itemized and given a value related to various upgrades."", ""Spread across nine missions, each with its own series of goals, Freedom Cry plays like a sampler platter of the many mission types in Black Flag. There are ships to sink, suspects to tail, and targets to kill. Just because this mini campaign is a fraction of the size of Kenway's adventure doesn't mean the missions themselves have to be smaller. Yet that's what you get with a couple of the eavesdropping settings; one confines you within a bar, rather than asking you to snoop via long walks through town. There's nothing wrong with these brief objectives, though they do give a sense that the game is more jam-packed with goals than it actually is. Like most other Assassin's Creed games, Freedom Cry is a more gratifying experience when you're accomplishing certain missions stealthily. It's all the more rewarding to liberate plantations quietly, since land owners begin to kill slaves once you're spotted."", ""The perpetual influx of slaves is a blunt allegory about how freeing such captives isn't a task for one man, let alone one assassin."", ""Between the dense town of Port-au-Prince and the adjacent jungle that provides cover for freed slaves, island life can feel rather confining. So it's to Freedom Cry's credit that it features the same mainline and optional content ratio of Black Flag. That includes a segment of the Caribbean available to explore by sea with no fewer than nine question marks worth investigating, as well as fort-invading, harpooning, and diving for treasure within sunken ships. While this gameplay loop very much resembles what you would experience on the seas of Black Flag, the added presence of slave ships to liberate provides a new, albeit minor, level of strategy in ship combat. The challenge comes in destroying escorts without damaging slave ships, a tough task depending on how close to each other ships remain in relation to your cannons' trajectories. The one drawback is that these opportunities to save large groups of slaves at sea in a single battle undermine the value of spending time freeing slaves on land one person at a time."", ""Adewale has a much cooler head than Edward Kenway, so it's easy to picture him adept at wielding swords and pistols while gracefully taking over enemy ships. Yet because of the limited resources of the resistance, he spends most of the game with brutal tools like a heavily used machete and the blunderbuss. However crude, the machete affords Adewale the same counter and break defense moves that we've seen from many other assassins. As a rare shotgun-style weapon for the series, the blunderbuss is highly effective in killing at least four colonists in a single round, and dubiously so when you have slaves and other bystanders in the line of fire. Since the main missions take less than four hours to clear, upgrading both Adewale and his ship is a much more abbreviated--and ultimately optional--endeavor than the deeper enhancement paths in Black Flag. You gain access to rope, sleep, and berserk darts early on, as well as the smoke bomb, which is a crowd-stunning weapon that, as it always has, gives too much power to the player."", 'Freedom Cry plays like a sampler platter of the many mission types in Black Flag.', ""From the infectious sea shanties to the jovial singing circles at the taverns, Black Flag was certainly the most musically vocal game in the series. Freedom Cry manages to match that, which is an achievement when you find out it doesn't feature sea shanties. This time, the in-game singing comes from the slaves tending the fields. Whether the songs were the earliest form of slave songs or merely hymns that evolved from African origins, I couldn't discern. Whatever their sources, the songs add texture to this cast of captive non-player characters, not to mention the game overall. Even Adewale participates when he uses a one-line chant as a password within the resistance movement. And while the non-vocal Pirates of the Caribbean-inspired music of Black Flag was functional at best, Freedom Cry's soundtrack gives the sea combat an epic atmosphere that the ship battles of the main game lacked. This suspiciously memorable soundtrack compelled me to check the game's credits, and where I learned that the music was composed by Remember Me's talented Olivier Deriviere."", ""With the strongest ensemble cast in the franchise, Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag wasn't short of assassins and pirates worthy of their own playable tales, DLC or otherwise. Freedom Cry is more than just another Assassin's Creed IV chapter with a reskinned protagonist, but its troubled handling of dark themes makes this a turbulent voyage.""]"Nathan Meunier,17-Dec-13,Bandfuse: Rock Legends Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/bandfuse-rock-legends-review/1900-6415607/,7,Xbox 360,"[""It has been quite a while since I've had a good excuse to pull out the old Ibanez sitting in my closet collecting dust, but BandFuse: Rock Legends' mix of rhythm game rocking and guitar training provided an excellent incentive. It blurs the line between musical rehearsal and plain-old fun, giving everyone from total guitar novices to more seasoned players the tools to rock out while improving their chops. While it might lack some of the more useful extras and visual pizzazz of the recent Rocksmith games, BandFuse is fun to pick up and play and delivers a straightforward guitar tablature-focused experience."", ""Getting the visuals and audio to sync up properly on HDTVs is one of the biggest nuisances plaguing the rhythm game genre. Spending a half-hour fiddling with finicky hardware tends to kill the mood when you just want to dive in and play. BandFuse takes a smart detour around all of that with the AudioLink adapter, a nice piece of kit that plugs into the back of your console and lets you stream the audio out to your TV or stereo through composite cables. It's lag-free, works perfectly, and sounds phenomenal. I also appreciate that the adapter includes a separate headphone jack to let you rock at high volume without blasting out your entire household."", ""Once you plug in and tune up--a thankfully intuitive and speedy process--you can dive into any selection in BandFuse's entire 55-track arsenal with a quick play session or explore them all in a more traditional campaign mode. The latter does away with any elaborate story trappings or goofy character gimmicks. You simply rock your way through a series of increasingly tough tours with names like Venomous Licks and Behemoths of Rock, earning money with each performance to go toward unlocking subsequent stages. Each tour offers a mix of multi-song gigs and one-off challenges to plow through, and the natural progression weaves in harder songs at a gradual pace."", 'Track-wise, BandFuse\'s eclectic mix of jams skews toward the rock, punk, and metal end of the spectrum. Face-melters like Children of Bodom\'s ""Are You Dead Yet"" and Testament\'s ""Souls of Black"" top a pleasantly finger-punishing stretch of the list, though plenty of catchy hits spanning the past four and a half decades make it in there too. Some tunes are recycled more than once as you go along, but rather than irritate, this structure encourages you to crank up the difficulty a little bit higher to push your skills as you progress and encounter tunes you\'ve already played.', ""BandFuse's biggest strength is the way it balances its gameplay elements with more serious guitar practice. There's a welcome focus on realism, but the fun of playing a game and boosting your score isn't lost in the mix. While it's not the most attractive setup, the no-nonsense interface makes it easy to gauge what's happening onscreen and what you're being asked to play. Instead of flying at you down a vertical runway, Guitar Hero-style, notes are charted out on a side-scrolling horizontal fret board that mirrors standard guitar tab. Anyone who has thumbed through a guitar magazine or hopped on the Internet to look up the chords to their favorite radio hit will feel right at home."", ""A forgiving scoring system leaves lots of room to improvise and fiddle around between the notes and chords you're meant to play. You're not penalized unless you miss the notes altogether, and even then it's impossible to fail a song completely. This flexibility is awesome for experimenting on the lower difficulty tiers, where newcomers really benefit from the freedom to ease into more complex playing styles. It's a freedom that evaporates entirely on the highest difficulty setting when you have to play songs note for note as the fret board fills with dizzying chaos meant for pro-level players."", ""Despite five different challenge levels to suit a broad range of playing abilities--from the total newbie to the hair-twirling shredmaster--it's hard to find the sweet spot as you outgrow your current skill range and try tunes on a higher setting. Shifting up and down across different skill levels is an uneven, jarring experience to say the least. If you have moderate guitar-playing abilities, the easiest settings get boring in a hurry, but stepping it up a notch throws a whole lot more at you all at once. It's easy to get overwhelmed and flustered. This isn't a total drag, however, because it spurs you to actually practice and improve your playing."", ""To that aim, BandFuse's learner-focused ShredU section packs lots of tutorial videos and inspirational vignettes from guitar pros like Slash, Mike Ness, Zakk Wylde, and more. While only a handful are interactive, they're very informative, assuming you're in the mood to sit and watch hours of footage rather than actually play. The Lick Lab and Practice menus are more useful if you're in a hands-on mood, because they let you tweak the speed of any song in the game to practice at a slower pace and even loop specific parts until you've mastered them. These diversions are helpful if you're looking to learn, even if they're not as entertaining as the musical minigame found in the competition."", ""Whether you plug in a guitar or a bass, the instrument sound quality is top-notch, and both offer a different challenge with a wide assortment of tracks that will keep even the most skilled musicians on their toes. A trio of virtual FX pedals include adjustable levels of autowah, overdrive, and digital delay to tinker with. Between those and a handful of amplifiers, there's enough to fine-tune your sound even if the limited selection doesn't come close to satiating the needs of more dedicated pedal enthusiasts. You can also plug in a USB microphone to sing along, though both this and local multiplayer require extra adapters and hardware."", ""BandFuse's biggest strength is the way it balances its gameplay elements with more serious guitar practice."", ""BandFuse's user-friendly approach to guitar mastery strikes some chords that Rocksmith misses. The tab-based gameplay is accessible and easy to grasp, which makes shredding through this heavy-hitting batch of tunes an entertaining and educational romp for players of all skill levels. A limited scope of extra bells and whistles, along with sharp difficulty spikes between tiers, is an occasional turnoff, but the rush that comes from improving your playing over time until you can nail these songs note for note smoothes out some of the rough edges.""]"Brett Todd,17-Dec-13,Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/baldur-s-gate-ii-enhanced-edition-review/1900-6415606/,7,PC,"[""Where Dungeons & Dragons is concerned, I've always been old-school. I got into the game as a child at the end of the 1970s, during the Gygaxian glory days when the big game was still Advanced and still loaded with more inscrutable numbers than a corporate tax return. That's how I've always liked it. The newfangled rules that supposedly make everything easier with changes like flipping around armor class just make my head hurt. If you can't understand that -10 is better than 10, I don't want to know you."", ""So Baldur's Gate II is the pinnacle of role-playing games for me. The BioWare epic got almost everything right about the original, unforgiving D&D when it was released back in 2000, and Overhaul Games hits the goblin right on the schnoz in 2013. The developer's reworking of one of the all-time greats into Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition combines the original Shadows of Amn, the Throne of Bhaal expansion, and a new gladiatorial combat side game into a bursting-at-the-seams package. Even after more than a decade, this sprawling saga remains the most authentic treatment of D&D to ever hit a computer. And it is even better than ever, thanks to numerous graphical tweaks and a pile of new content that shows how much Overhaul has gotten its act together in comparison with the problematic release of the first enhanced Baldur's Gate game last year."", 'Not that the original game could ever be said to be in need of more stuff. Completists will put in a good 100 hours with Baldur\'s Gate II: Shadows of Amn, while Throne of Bhaal adds another 40 or more. Both games are loaded with memorable (and personable, depending on how much you take to space hamsters and self-righteous druids) non-player characters and party members and challenging tactical combat--not to mention quests that play out like classic pen-and-paper modules and a rogues\' gallery of monsters and villains ranging all the way from mephits and vampires to mind flayers and a spectacularly snotty red dragon. The game hardly needed extras, although the new characters, quests, and gladiatorial games are a good impetus for players who can get a lot of the $20 ""enhanced"" presentation by loading up free user-made mods with the original game, which can be purchased online for less than $10.', 'Battles are intricate, tactical affairs where you have to blend careful use of melee fighters with the smart use of mages, clerics, and the like.', ""The original plot remains impressive, telling the continuing Bhaalspawn saga about the protagonist coming to terms with his or her identity as the offspring of the dead god of murder. Script and story are much more mature than what was presented in the first Baldur's Gate. Even the main villain, a dead-faced sadistic monster named Jon Irenicus, whom you are first introduced to during torture sessions in his dungeon, is more memorably evil than the previous game's more prototypical baddie, Sarevok."", 'Because of the above, plus a more careful design, all of your actions are more directed and more purposeful. Where the first game saw you crawling through every square inch of what seemed to be endless wilderness maps, looking for battles to earn you enough experience points to level up and take on gangs of murderous kobolds and the like, here you accept a quest, go more or less straight to its location, and get right to slaying powerhouse mages, parlaying with demons, challenging vampire clans, and so forth. The ante has been upped across the board, starting with an introductory-level adventure for first-level characters, and moving to a much more challenging foray with experienced heroes who start at level seven and above. You feel this with every monster you kill and every magical item you loot from a corpse.', ""Coming along with this epic feel is epic difficulty. Baldur's Gate might be the hardest RPG ever made. Battles are intricate, tactical affairs where you have to blend careful use of melee fighters with the smart use of mages, clerics, and the like. Battle preparation is vital. You should memorize the spellbooks of your characters to see what works best for each possible situation. If you don't maximize your chances of survival with smart spellcasting, which includes prep work like throwing out some haste and bless spells before even going into fights, you will not survive for long."", ""In many ways, this is more of a strategy game than an RPG, particularly by today's standards. Some battles are excruciatingly tough without the use of certain spells. I ran into trouble at various points in the game, and it's impressive just how many encounters require you to exercise some gray matter instead of whipping out a sword and some magic missiles. I kept beating my head against one early battle with a group of Hulk-like golems who activated as soon as I swiped the magic items that they were protecting. After 30 minutes or so of getting beaten into a fine red goo, I realized that I could use something as basic as a cleric's sanctuary spell to put up a cloaking field, then wander in, steal everything, and slink on out without being spotted by these murderous guardians."", ""All that said, sometimes the game goes too far. The difficulty is artificially ramped up, and the game's reach exceeds its grasp in some aspects of the design. Dungeon levels consist of far too many tiny corridors that present daunting challenges to your party of six adventurers. Pathfinding remains abysmal, so characters frequently perform Keystone Kops routines where they walk into one another and turn around. These guys take the long way around far too often. I can't recall how many battles I stumbled into, went to my go-to mage to soften up baddies with a little summoning or fireballing...and then realized that she was wandering through a chamber all the way on the other side of the crypt or cavern."", ""The game's reach exceeds its grasp in some aspects of the design."", ""Even worse, the game design often relies on the small size of the dungeons to make battles harder. You frequently walk into a tiny room and get gooned by foes right on the doorstep. This little trick typically results in the back-line heroes in your party formation (almost always your vital spellcasters) being unable to get through the logjam. As a result, they can't get involved in the battle, even to fire off arrows or cast those oh-so-necessary spells. Even your fighters up front don't fare well here, since they can't move. They wind up sandwiched between the enemies in front of them and their useless allies behind them. Say hello to an old-fashioned beatdown. The only way to deal with these battles, and many others that begin on more of a level playing field, is to lose first and then use that experience to figure out what spells need to be cast, before loading a save and going into that battle again."", ""New content doesn't add all that much to the original games. It is nice to have, although the fit isn't perfect. The four added adventurers (including the three introduced in last year's Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition and a fourth brand-new one) add some variety to your parties, but there are some oddities. Their dialogue often seems out of place. They come off a little too modern (sex jokes do not work well in a game this buttoned-down) and self-referential in comparison with the original characters, who played things mostly straight and serious. The most unimpressive additions, however, are the crashes to desktop, which are common enough to frustrate."", ""Hexxat, the lone all-new character, has an intriguing backstory and can be of use in battles, but she's inaccessible to good parties due to her evil alignment. (Good luck trying to justify keeping her around in a party led by a paladin.) Her romance option is same-sex-only, which makes her off-limits for any male protagonist who wants to knock some boots before venturing forth; if you're porting over a dude from the first Baldur's Gate, you're out of luck when it comes to the new romantic content. The combat-heavy new mode of play, The Black Pits II: Gladiators of Thay, is a worthy sequel to its predecessor, but it doesn't offer much more than a succession of the same sorts of tactical battles you get in the main games, only there you also get the benefit of great storytelling and more involving quests."", ""Despite all of the above, I have to admit that I am probably most fond of Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition because of nostalgia. Not that this is entirely a bad thing. As much as I've gotten used to modern, hold-your-hand RPGs like Mass Effect 3, there is something to be said for this take-no-prisoners blast from the past, especially if you love old-timey D&D as much as I do. And even if you don't have this particular predilection, you should check the game out anyhow, because an experience as legendary as Baldur's Gate II is well worth the effort.""]"Daniel Starkey,17-Dec-13,Speedball 2 HD Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/speedball-2-hd-review/1900-6415599/,6,PC,"[""Speedball is what you might get if you crossed football, hockey, kickboxing, and street gangs. It's a brutal sport pitting two teams of hulking meat men against one another. Scoring goals is just as valuable as knocking out other players, and true to the game's name, matches are quick, taking only a few minutes. Yet as breezy as Speedball 2 may seem at first, there is a welcome modicum of depth lurking just beneath the surface."", ""There are only two objectives to concern yourself with in Speedball 2: pound your opponents to a blood pulp or score incredible goals. And those two intuitive aspirations are handled by a streamlined control scheme without any fluff. Ready to mash heads? Then get to it! When you have the ball, the action button passes it in the direction you're facing, and when you don't have possession, the button triggers a slide tackle, which you can use to steadily beat down the other team. Knocking out enemy players is rewarded with just as many points as scoring goals, which is probably why you're never given the ability to choose which speedballer you control. If you could, it wouldn't be long before the game turned into a poor man's brawler. Even so, passing the ball to enemy players before slide-tackling them is not only an acceptable tactic, but one of the best around. It guarantees hits, and if you're really aggressive, you never even have to try to score. Instead, you can just force opponents to flip through their substitute players, gradually weakening their team."", ""Beyond bashing in heads and shooting for goals, the field is busy with random bits that can confuse enemy players or score you extra points. In front of each goal there's a bumper providing another obstacle for careless goalkeepers who simply try to swat the ball away. If you're defending your goal and not paying attention, it's fairly easy to shoot the ball at the bumper, only to have it come straight back into your goal. Additionally, offensive players can use the bumper to confuse the defense. Each bounce gives two points, so if you have a few moments when no one is opposing you, making a shot at the bumper before shooting for the goal quickly doubles your yield and makes an offensive run more productive."", ""On the sides of the pitch there are ramps that accelerate the ball in certain directions, but they also act as score multipliers. If you can push the ball through once, you receive a 50 percent boost to all points you score--knockouts, goals, bumper hits--and if you can manage two shots, then you receive double points. If your opponents make it through the ramp, though, then you lose that bonus. In the career mode, if you're trying to beat a team with better stats, carefully controlling the ramps can halve the total number of goals/knockouts needed to win, meaning that tactical players can make up for physical weaknesses."", 'Other doodads on the field include portals that can move the ball to the opposite side of the field and stars for each team that can be hit for extra points. Just like the bumpers and the ramps, stars and portals help weaker players balance themselves against superior opponents. As the game progresses, power-ups also appear; these can temporarily paralyze enemy players or give your team shields that protect your players from tackles.', ""Jumping into the career mode helps you learn the ropes beyond the game's tutorial, which is sadly buried in the game's menus. You can set up your own team with your name, but you need to use one of the prebuilt team logos and color schemes. After that, you can manage individual players, transfer in new ones from other teams, and send players to the gym to work out and help boost their stats. At the start of each game, there's a bar that shows your team's general strength vs. your opponents. It's meant to be a loose estimation of who is likely to win based on your team's formation and stats, but the bar is not always an accurate measure of your potential for success, especially early on."", ""Winning matches nets you cash over time, which helps you build and refine your team, but after a certain point, most of your players are much stronger than anyone else's, and games become absurdly easy. While my first few matches had scores that were pretty close, after season three, I would regularly shut out the other teams and score hundreds of points, until I progressed far enough to play in the Intergalactic Cup. It's a season-end competition that pits you against brutally powerful teams from all over the galaxy. It takes quite a while to build your team up to a point where you can reasonably compete here, but it offers the toughest challenge available without seeking out other human beings."", ""Outside of the career mode, you have options for quick matches and basic local-only multiplayer. The multiplayer option lets you quickly select a one-off match for you and your friend using preset teams. The other main mode, Custom Cup, helps you set up a large tournament with several people and some computer players. Unfortunately, both of these modes run on the same machine, meaning that without controllers or multiple keyboards (which are both supported), you and a friend have to cram your hands onto a single keyboard, which is not a comfortable experience. Regardless, multiplayer lacks the depth and sense of progression offered by the career mode. While fairly minimal, the career's team-building mechanics and the promise of tougher opponents do a pretty good job of pushing you forward. Without those elements, local multiplayer is good for quick matches when you and a buddy might be in the mood, but there's little to keep you invested beyond that."", 'My experience was sadly marred by several bugs in the menus that kept me adjusting sound levels or controls. After a dozen or so resets, everything seemed like it was working, only to have the game lock up and wipe both my saved team data and my progress. It happened only once, and I played a total of about 12 hours, but it still cost me a good chunk of time.', ""Speedball 2 is quite a bit deeper than you may initially suspect, and the enjoyable career mode's sense of progression is enough to keep you pushing onward. Without an online or even a LAN option, though, the bare-bones multiplayer limits the competitive thrills, and you can't bring in your team from the career mode and pit them against your friends' teams, which is shame. Instead, Speedball teaches you how to play and sets you loose, but leaves you with only a handful of avenues to explore the possibilities.""]"Carolyn Petit,17-Dec-13,The Walking Dead: Season Two - A Telltale Games Series Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-walking-dead-season-two-episode-1-all-that-rem/1900-6415605/,6,PC,"[""It's hard to imagine learning to trust anyone in the world of The Walking Dead. It's not just the question of whether or not people are basically decent. It's the reality that if you put too much pressure on even well-meaning people, sooner or later, most of them are going to break. And the world of The Walking Dead is a constant pressure cooker. But Clementine, the young survivor of the series' first season, can't hope to make it in this world on her own, and so she has little choice but to cast her lot in with a new group of people struggling just to live day to day in a land crawling with zombies and ruthless scavengers."", ""The first episode of the new season, All That Remains, has a few harrowing moments and a gameplay sequence that will make you squirm as you uncomfortably empathize with a suffering character, but the element that made the first season of The Walking Dead so powerful--those quiet, heavy choices in moments of human interaction--is largely absent here. The episode's focus is clearly on setting up the characters and conflicts that might pay off in later chapters; it serves a narrative purpose, but isn't especially effective on its own terms."", ""Almost immediately, All That Remains reminds us of just how fragile life is after the decline of society. It also reminds us of just how restrictively linear The Walking Dead can sometimes be, for a series that places so much focus on choice. As Clementine, you're required to make a colossal (if understandable) error in judgment in an early section that ends up having tremendous consequences. Throughout the game, this sense of tension between choice and rigid plot structure surfaces multiple times."", ""Yes, you make choices in conversations about what to tell characters, how much to reveal or to conceal about your past. But when you're locked in a garage and told by other characters to wait there until morning, you can't choose to stay put. Morning will never come unless you bust out of the garage, break into the nearby house, and go dangerously sneaking around. In moments like these, you feel the heavy hand of plot structure making many of Clementine's decisions for you. The episode also seems confused about just how capable Clementine is. At one point, a character chastises her for not working hard enough to develop some basic survival skills, which makes Clementine seem more vulnerable and imperiled. But later, she seems tremendously self-sufficient, tending to a serious wound on her own."", ""Much of All That Remains' time is spent bringing Clementine into contact with a new group of survivors and giving you an opportunity to learn a little bit about these people. Clementine's arrival sows seeds of tension in the group as some feel a responsibility to help the tough little cookie out while others don't want the group burdened with another member (who may, some argue, be a spy for another group that threatens their survival). There's the older guy Pete, who knows how to use a gun and can be gruff and guarded but quickly opens up to Clementine. A bit too quickly to be believed, I thought--the series doesn't have much time to establish its characters before all hell starts breaking loose, but Pete's candor felt like it was in the service of plot rather than serving the authentic needs and desires of the character."", 'Then there\'s Carlos, a doctor and fiercely overprotective father, who says that his daughter Sarah is different in some way, and that she can\'t handle the harsh realities of the world they live in. Sarah\'s a strange one, to be sure. She\'s clearly older than Clementine, but she acts much younger; she asks Clementine to seal their friendship with a ""pinky swear,"" which the world-weary Clementine finds mighty strange. To me, it was almost impossible to believe that the clearly intelligent Sarah would have such an immature disposition at her age, but perhaps more will be revealed in coming episodes to support this characterization.', ""And it's this dilemma that makes evaluating this episode quite difficult. It's clearly not intended to stand on its own in the long term, and the characterizations it establishes may work better when more pieces fall into place. But All That Remains tries to cover a lot of expository ground, and characterization suffers as a result. Still, subtle voice work and facial details--a glance, a quickly passing frown--give us insight into Clementine's mindset, and because we have the benefit of an entire season spent getting to know her already, her emotions are accessible to us. I've grown to care enough about her that I'm more than willing to endure this episode's shortcomings to see what Telltale has planned down the road.""]"Nick Capozzoli,16-Dec-13,DUST 514 Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dust-514-review/1900-6415604/,4,PS3,"['One AGM-114 Hellfire air-to-ground missile costs the United States military around $70,000 each time a drone operator pulls a trigger, which, the army boasts, has happened more than 11,000 times since 2001. It\'s this colossal expenditure of resources that drives the gears of the war machine: usage creates demand, and demand creates billions of dollars in revenue. All that money considered, it\'s a surprise that the games industry has been so slow on the uptake. While free-to-play mobile games have begun charting the waters of the microtransaction with purchasable boosters and depleting ""energy"" systems, billion-dollar stalwarts like Call of Duty remain moored to reliable models: compelling gameplay and annual full-price iterations. In this Skinner box factory, intended obsolescence is the name of the game. Then, in steps Icelandic developer CCP, contriving to build a better mousetrap. Dust 514 is the result.', ""What if an online shooter persisted, receiving patches and features instead of ceding the floor to its next of kin? What if it aspired to build a world beyond menu screens and battle arenas? What if every death had an associated dollar value, a sunk cost in munitions and equipment? Those are the questions Dust posed before its release last May, and they were questions worth asking. But it has become increasingly clear that the game's answers just won't do. It has taken some time to feel comfortable making that proclamation, because CCP's flagship game EVE Online is the poster child for delayed success. EVE survived its inauspicious debut by doggedly improving upon its initial offering. Dust 514 has improved too, reaching version 1.7 just this past week. It's tempting to wonder if the cure to the game's ills lies in some such string of coming patch notes, but unfortunately, Dust's problems are innate."", 'Dust 514 shares more than just a design ethos with EVE Online; the two games occupy the same server, too. The shooter is intended to complement EVE\'s space-faring massively multiplayer role-playing game, where player corporations vie for military and economic supremacy. Players in Dust assume the role of mercenary soldiers, contracted by corporations in EVE to battle over planetary resources. The battles play out as isolated skirmishes, either to control key points on the map or to diminish the other side\'s supply of tickets (here, clone reserves). Barring a bit of new phraseology about ""virus uploads"" or ""NULL cannons,"" it\'s familiar territory for veterans of other first-person shooters, sci-fi or no.', ""Really, for all the future trappings, Dust's version of war is fairly of our time. Infantry scurry about, securing objectives and shooting projectiles into one another. Tanks and stationary turrets fire. Vehicles with rear-mounted machine guns roam about, shuttling troops to the front lines. Even the game's much-ballyhooed orbital strike, in which EVE players are dialed up for a quick extraterrestrial bombardment, isn't all that different from a good old Hellfire missile in practice. It's an unimaginative waste of a fanciful premise; in Dust's futuristic universe, the war machine chugs on."", ""It's a familiar sort of dystopian cynicism--death and destruction for the sake of quarterly financial reports and shareholder portfolios--that Dust 514 carries for better and worse. It manifests in the game's fiction, with wry touches like the polite public announcements cautioning against public suicide. Or the nagging sense that a battle between armies of immortal clones is an exercise in spinning wheels. It's also visible in the beautiful future weapons that fill the storefront of the game's virtual marketplace, where the latest variants from Duvolle Laboratories and Kaalakiota Corporation occupy tiled spaces like app store entries--killing tools, the lot of them, all hawked like the year's hottest holiday item."", ""The most prominent positions are given to the weapons that can be had with aurum, a currency amassed through real money transactions and the cornerstone of Dust's monetization scheme. Dust encourages their purchase by implementing a lethargic rate of progression. Skill points accrued in battle can only be used toward boosts of 3 percent here, 0.5 there, never feeling substantive. It's not exactly that Dust 514 is a pay-to-win game (if only because most players don't seem to bother with the aurum-only items); it's that the progression system runs afoul of the parity most shooters work tirelessly to pinpoint. The incremental benefits Dust doles out may not feel immediately rewarding, but months of earned skills and cash eventually do add up to the point where veteran players have quantifiable advantages over newbies. In EVE, such discrepancies can be mitigated with sheer numbers or pluck. Not so in Dust, where teams are capped at 16 players and gameplay is suffocatingly rigid."", ""It's an unimaginative waste of a fanciful premise; in Dust's futuristic universe, the war machine chugs on."", ""The gameplay's more tangible issues are too numerous to recount in full. Battlegrounds are too large for the player count, resulting in long stretches where enemies are nowhere to be found. They're wastelands of muddy industrial sameness, with no attention to scale or flow. Paths dead-end nonsensically. Ladders and hallways lead to empty rooms devoid of relation to objectives or tactics. Weapon types are tremendously imbalanced. Audio effects sound cheap and have little relevance to the direction or proximity of their source. Dips in the frame rate result in distant enemies frequently looking like they're moving in stop-motion. The list goes on, but the problems run deeper."", ""Games like Halo and Call of Duty may be more limited in scope than Dust 514, but they can stave off any existential dread through the excitement and immediacy of their combat. Dust can make no such claims. Its poor gameplay is a taint that spreads upward from the roots, vitiating the lofty aspirations of its other features. Skill and weapon unlocks, ordinarily the cherry on top of a satisfying gaming session, morph into taunting reminders of the grind to come. The experience points, money, and items that signify forward progress become signposts that warn you're going in circles: kill to get better weapons, to kill better, to get better weapons. All the work CCP puts into crafting a larger dystopian fiction bleeds into the real experience in this fashion: you feel like a cog in a formless machine, working--not playing--in service to obscure overlords and nebulous goals."", ""Dust's link to EVE was supposed to provide the context for these endless war games. But the bond between the two games remains ill-defined. Corporations, the life blood of EVE, barely receive an introduction in Dust. Ditto for the former game's vast libraries of lore. Sitting in the cramped mercenary's quarters, just a few menu clicks away from jumping into battles all across the universe, it's impossible to get a sense of the vastness of space that makes the massively multiplayer online role-playing game at once so daunting and mysterious. We know that data transmits across the void between EVE and Dust, because a name taken in one cannot be used in the other. But personality never makes the jump."", 'A few features are cognate. The seeds of Dust\'s atrocious tutorial can be recognized in CCP\'s decade-long struggle to introduce new players to EVE. The game\'s preoccupation with byzantine menus is similarly rooted in EVE\'s history. Its player customization system is also translated from EVE\'s spaceship-building mechanic. In the shooter, dropsuit ""fittings"" are assembled from market purchases and salvage, with an eye toward available power and storage space. Yet in EVE, favored ships can often be crafted objects, built lovingly with expectations that they\'ll survive for as long as their pilots keep their wits about them. In Dust, death is an inevitability, and with each failure, your inventory softens. Fitting a dropsuit, consequently, begins to feel like assembly-line work. Once a viable setup has been found, it\'s just a matter of restocking it as necessary.', ""Dust 514 is an effective simulation of the economies whirring away within the military industrial complex--a farcical war to perpetuate EVE Online's inexorable cycles of death and demand. But Dust 514 needs to offer more than emerging markets for players in CCP's other, better game in order to justify its own existence.""]"Leif Johnson,13-Dec-13,Huntsman: The Orphanage Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/huntsman-the-orphanage-review/1900-6415603/,6,PC,"[""Huntsman: The Orphanage prompts many questions. Who is the huntsman? How did 12 orphans vanish without a trace from a rural Illinois orphanage in 1897? For that matter, where can I pick up that sweet smartphone that talks to the dead and never loses a charge? Huntsman doesn't answer all of these questions, but some of its chief pleasures lie in rummaging among old suitcases and piles of dusty prosthetics for clues to the answers. When paired with its creepy namesake, it's a premise that manages to deliver some genuine chills, but it's not long before its web of creepypasta stories ensnare you more than any sense of dread. That's both a blessing and a curse."", 'ShadowShifters, the studio behind the project, created a game that frightens more by ambience than with the jump scares, blood, and violence that define many horror games (and movies) these days. Many of its most effective chills actually spring from the expectation of scares common in horror games that came before it, and indeed, the first tentative steps of the game lead you down a wooded road, past a phone booth, and up to the wrought iron gates of a decaying institution. A casual onlooker could be fooled into thinking you were playing through the start of Outlast.', ""But there's no blood here, and if there were, it's had over 100 years to fade away. Perfect opportunities for jump scares present themselves and pass, and even 20 minutes into the game you might still believe that this really is just an abandoned complex in modern Illinois, and that the falling crosses and self-closing doors really do owe their existence to nothing besides the wind. By the time I came across the rare wonder of a chalkboard writing a helpful tutorial by itself, I found myself not so much spooked as grateful for the novelty."", 'Thank goodness you have the best smartphone in the world at your disposal. Its constant presence puts Huntsman: The Orphanage in the same class as ""weaponless"" horror games in the vein of Outlast and Amnesia, and most of the time you use it as a flashlight but, alas, with none of the dread that springs from losing battery power. The phone\'s existence comes into its own, however, when the voices and images of the 12 missing children come crackling through it, begging you to find their favorite belongings and return them to their graves so their souls can be free of the dreaded huntsman.', ""Sometimes they interrupt you with flashes of video when you get near said items. Sometimes they pop up and tell you stories with clues from their past when you hover the phone over the portraits scattered throughout the orphanage. And in most cases, the excellent voice work for the accompanying stories makes up for some of the limitations of the surrounding visuals. Tales of chopping off hands at the woodpile suggest that these orphans aren't angelic innocents, and some of them speak with just enough hints of menace that you might balk at placating them with gifts. They don't even let up on the creepy act after you've found their junk and tossed it on their hidden graves."", ""It's fitting that the voice work excels over so much of the rest of the experience. (If there's a drawback to this focus, it's that you have to stare at their photos the whole time to hear the full narration.) The orphans spill their lines, dropping hints based on their histories, and then you set out to dig in and around the inky-dark ruins of the orphanage to find the relevant items. It's tougher than it sounds. The relevant items don't glow or otherwise make their presence known, and since you can't interact with some of them unless you crouch or lie down, you may not even know you're looking at one even though you're staring right at it."", 'Some of its chief pleasures lie in rummaging among old suitcases and piles of dusty prosthetics.', ""It's here that Huntsman's overused visual assets unexpectedly come in handy. Dozens of copies of the same Dutch painting and black-and-white group photo litter the rooms of the two-story orphanage, and you grow so used to them and the sight of the same books and blue suitcases that anything else stands out in stark contrast. Good thing, too. Huntsman may be a game about exploring, thinking, and listening at heart, but on many occasions, you find the pieces just by dumb luck. It's sometimes challenging enough with the current design; it might be a nightmare in more detailed environs."", ""Speaking of nightmares, what of the huntsman? His comparative absence in the review so far may show just how weak of an impression he tends to leave. Oh, he starts out scary enough. You see him first by the light of your phone in the enveloping darkness, with hairy arachnid legs and an upper body that looks like a steampunk dandy sporting a Renaissance plague mask, and his presence is heralded by the sound of what resembles the ticking of a dozen grandfather clocks. Knowing that this fascinating thing awaits somewhere in the dark creates much of the game's early tension."", ""Regrettably, it's a sensation that doesn't last long. The cacophony of ticking makes him absurdly easy to avoid (particularly when paired with stereo headphones), and once I found him just staring off into space as if ruminating over his poor life choices over the last century. Even when he catches you and sucks you into limbo, the G-rated fade to black might make you wonder if the game's not simply bugging out if you didn't know better."", ""Once you start to put the children's items back on their graves, however, the experience changes for the better. The catch is that all their graves lie scattered in a sprawling, overgrown hedge maze, and that's when you should look forward to playing in the dark with the door closed and your headphones firmly clamped on. You can always hear the tick-tocking of the huntsman, yes, but the design thrives on the realization that any wrong turn might dump you right in front of its face. With enough repetition--there are, after all, 12 children--it's possible to learn the general layout, but in those early moments, Huntsman: The Orphanage does much to live up to its horror label."", ""Huntsman: The Orphanage does manage to convey a sense of terror in its quiet moments, but they're more benign chills than you find in bloodier horror adventures that let you fight back or at least present enemies who do more than engulf you in darkness. Its greatest frights lie in the anticipation that anything could lurk in the darkness, but once you realize that it's just you and a clockwork Spider-Man, you might find that you're no longer as afraid of the dark as you once were. And in a horror game? That's just scary.""]"John Robertson,13-Dec-13,Bravely Default Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/bravely-default-review/1900-6415602/,8,3DS,"[""Let's not kid ourselves. While Bravely Default may not officially be part of the Final Fantasy family, it's only in name that it's not. From steampunk airships, to Phoenix Down revive potions, to enemies named Cait Sith, Bravely Default has got the unmistakable stamp of Japan's most recognisable and venerable role-playing game series plastered all over it. And yet, despite the baggage of both expectation and suspicion that accompanies anything associated with said megafranchise, Bravely Default manages to carve out a place for itself amongst the impressive roster of Nintendo 3DS Japanese RPGs."", ""It says a lot that this game has come not from the hands and talents of Square Enix, but from those of 3D Dot Game Heroes developer Silicon Studio. Things don't start off well, however. Take away the beautiful art style, and the first few hours provide little we've not seen before and little incentive to continue. The story of wholesome hero Tiz Arrior seeking answers to and revenge for the apparently random destruction of his homeland is hardly a new one, and while the near fully voiced handheld RPG demonstrates impressive production values, the ear-splitting pitch of each character's dialogue is excuse enough to abandon dialogue scenes altogether (or at least mute the volume)."", ""While Bravely Default may not officially be part of the Final Fantasy family, it's only in name that it's not."", ""Get past those opening sequences, and you're gifted with a game that gets close to rejuvenating a stagnating formula, expanding and altering ideas that have been detrimentally unyielding for too many years. Silicon Studio has been wise in highlighting which areas to refresh, and given that the game so heavily relies on it, it's apt that the battle system should be Bravely Default's greatest asset."", 'A few additions to the turn-based combat keep Bravely Default from ever becoming predictable. Alongside the normal attack, magic, and item commands sit options to ""brave"" and ""default."" Select brave, and you can unleash up to four moves in a single turn, the risk being that if your enemies are still alive after your assault, you must wait for them to execute the same number of turns until you can act again. Conversely, default allows you to forfeit your current turn in exchange for banking an extra move to use later.', ""Each member of your four-person team can brave and default independently of each other, allowing some to stay aggressive with all-or-nothing flurries of four moves at a time, while others take a step back and store moves as a safety net in case of trouble down the line. It can be wise, for example, when you're faced with a formidable enemy, to make sure one character (preferably a healer) stores up moves by defaulting to allow him to restore the entire team to full health if things start getting out of hand."", ""Take away the beautiful art style, and the first few hours provide little we've not seen before and little incentive to continue."", ""It's essential that you master this core dynamic of putting yourself in credit and debt if you harbor any desire whatsoever of making headway once the hand-holding stops. Certain enemies, especially bosses, have been designed to make victory incredibly difficult to achieve without intelligent use of brave/default. In particular, many tougher enemies are in the habit of healing themselves when on the verge of death--the only way to overcome them being to attack multiple times with brave at the right moment. In short: ignore the brave/default system at your peril."", ""If you are finding things too difficult, you have the option of altering the difficulty when, and as often as, you like. Yes, this means you can tone the challenge down for a single battle, only to go back to normal once you've progressed. An adjustable random encounter rate allows further customisation of the difficulty level, letting you do away with nonessential battles altogether or increase them to the point where it feels like you can't take a step without being assaulted. How interested you are in leveling up your characters determines how you approach random battles."", ""A robust and diverse job system broadens combat by bestowing each character with a well-defined set of abilities and stats. With 24 to choose from (although unlocking them all is easier said than done), there are a wide variety of combat styles to experiment with and potentially master. Indeed, a lot of the fun comes from testing out different combinations before you settle on a formula (or two) that you feel best suits a team of four. You're free to swap a character's job as often as you want, so if a particular mix isn't working for a certain boss, there's nothing preventing you from approaching it from a completely different angle until your next attempt. It's to Bravely Default's enormous credit that both the job and brave/default systems work so well in tandem."", 'If you are finding things too difficult, you have the option of altering the difficulty when, and as often as, you like.', ""It's a good thing that the core gameplay is so enticing and engrossing, because the story never manages to rid itself of the tedium and convolution of those opening few hours. While the characters, cliched though they are, give off enough charm to make them entertaining (the pantomime-grade villains are especially amusing), the moment-to-moment plot points lack much in the way of intrigue or surprise. Much of the narrative feels like filler designed to lengthen the game rather than elaborate on the story or provide added insight to events or a character's motivations."", ""A wide variety of well-crafted side missions are available and act as decent distraction, while an equally wide-ranging number of StreetPass integrations are also worthy of your time. In particular, a minigame akin to something you might find on Facebook has you rebuilding Tiz's destroyed village of Norende. This is achieved by clicking on buildable portions of a map screen and assigning workers to start construction--the more workers a construction zone has, the faster it will be built (including when your 3DS is in sleep mode). New workers are acquired with every registered StreetPass, allowing you to build faster and farm the reward items completed structures provide. Less welcome is a sleep point system; each spent point lets you freeze time and launch a free attack. One sleep point is gained for every eight hours your 3DS is in standby mode, or you can part with extra real-world cash and purchase points via a microtransaction."", ""Despite that unwelcome intrusion and the lacklustre storytelling, Bravely Default is one of the finest RPGs Square Enix has been involved with in recent times. While it's a stretch to call its battle mechanics groundbreaking, they certainly represent a welcome level of innovation that has a palpable effect on the way you approach combat and makes Bravely Default a highly entertaining adventure.""]"Cameron Woolsey,12-Dec-13,Gomo Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/gomo-review/1900-6415601/,5,PC,"[""What would you do to save your friend? That is the question asked in Gomo, where a greedy alien kidnaps your dog and demands that you retrieve a mystical crystal artifact within two hours, or else. What this mysterious red crystal does, I never found out. All I know is that it is imbued with some sort of power. But that doesn't matter; some extraterrestrial jerk has your dog, and that makes things personal."", ""The game stars Gomo, a stubby-legged, long-armed sack boy, in a 2D point-and-click adventure that takes him from his small home in the hillside to underground caverns, grassy fields, and even beyond the world itself. You move through the world by solving puzzles as they appear. Puzzles are straightforward and are not difficult to solve. It's doubtful you will ever remain stumped in Gomo. Most puzzles require you to find an item--usually stored inside Gomo's sack-like body via a zipper on his back--and combine it with another, such as unlocking a nearby door with a key only a short distance away, or pulling a lever to activate a switch. Most items used to solve puzzles are tossed aside after their usefulness is spent."", ""The puzzles are uninspired, and several don't even make logical sense. For example, one puzzle has you shear a sheep to reveal a passcode to a door, while another has a picture which drops a can of herbicide. One puzzle is directly lifted from BioShock's hacking minigame, and two others are those slide puzzles that bitter people give children on Halloween instead of candy. You can deactivate easy mode in the menu, but all that does is remove the ethereal glow around items when you hover over objects you can interact with, which turns the game into a basic click hunt. The puzzle sequences at the end are just momentary pauses in what is otherwise a simple game. I would say a straightforward game, but Gomo is anything but."", ""The alien in the introduction sequence gives Gomo a command to find a shiny red crystal in exchange for his dog. But there isn't much of a clear path, and Gomo just meanders forward, flipping switches and using machines to open doors as he passes. He rides mine carts and uses the crystal (once found) to activate a hamster-powered device; he rides in a hot-air balloon, and, apparently, nukes the future. I'll admit I'm a little confused by that one."", ""The protagonist himself, with misshapen eyes, and who scurries along on stubby legs while using his long arms to lift himself onto steps, is adorable. His hand-drawn world is rife with little details that make each scene interesting, unless you find yourself quickly growing tired of the game's color palette, which is mostly varying shades of brown. The game is often humorous, tossing in some slapstick comedy as well as throwing in brief pop-culture references. You cannot make the game screen any larger than a small square surrounded by thick black borders, though that is perhaps a remnant of its history as a flash game. Beyond that complaint, Gomo the game isn't all that bad; it's just not very compelling."", ""The game is a short ride, and can easily be finished in a sitting. I cleared it in less than an hour and a half. You have the choice to play through it again and hunt down special pieces of paper that unlock three bonus minigames, but it wouldn't be worth your time. They are basically Whac-A-Mole games except that you wallop the dognapping alien instead of rodents. Gomo is a short, stylistic adventure that has some interesting features, but ultimately its brevity and lack of challenge keep its charms from being lasting ones.""]"Tom Mc Shea,12-Dec-13,Samurai Gunn Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/samurai-gunn-review/1900-6415600/,8,PC,"[""Do you know who fights with honor? Dead people. Life is fragile in Samurai Gunn, too fragile to worry whether your unsavory tactics might blemish your stellar reputation. An honorable person wouldn't lie among the fallen fighters, ready to surprise enemies with a flourish of sword slashes and gunshots, nor would someone who has dignity position himself near respawn points, eager to vanquish foes with little chance for retaliation. If feigning death keeps you alive one more minute, then be as still as possible, and let your defeated friends bicker about the right way to compete. You may have played dirty, but don't be ashamed; you alone are left to enjoy the spoils of victory."", ""Samurai Gunn is a two-dimensional brawler with a dark heart. Four local friends take part in frantic fights to prove their quickness with a sword, deftness with a gun, and their shrewdness in the heat of combat. One screen reins everyone into a diminutive arena, and as you leap up walls and dash through bamboo paths, you're never far from bursting into a bloody mess. Because just one strike ends your life, you learn to accept your failings. Your friend may have slain you with one perfectly timed shot as he plummeted toward the bottom of the screen, but next time, you may reflect that bullet right back at him, or rush toward him before he can pepper you from afar."", ""Tactics are thrust to the forefront once you master the basic controls. With three other players dancing around you, death comes quickly to the unprepared, so a little bit of thought goes a long way toward ringing up the kills. If trickery is your desire, just kneel down near dead bodies or deep in spike-laden pits, hoping to blend in to the environment to surprise a distracted foe. Or maybe long-range attacks are your specialty. Slide up and down walls, and use platforms to your advantage, as you keep your distance while bringing pain. Of course, such a strategy won't last long, given that you have only three shots per life, and if you should fall into a pond, your ancient gun sprays only water. Samurai Gunn swallows anyone who lacks versatility. Rely on any one plan for too long, and your friends will catch on, and your run at the top will end."", ""Victory is achieved in one of two ways, depending on which option you choose--by killing the most or being the last to use up your stock of lives. With the former goal, offense is emphasized. You must continually stalk your friends or else you're left with nary a point to your name. Samurai Gunn is fast and deadly in this mode. Blood splatters as each character dies, respawns, and then dies again, and any setback must be brushed aside as you rush once more into the fray. The kinetic excitement leads to moments of pure joy--such as when the person in last place goes on a killing spree to wrest away victory--and the ending of a match only makes you eager to jump into another round on a different map. Maybe you want to test your mettle on the icy mountains, where icicles can impale you from above, or crawl upon the sticky ceiling of the graveyard to laugh in the face of gravity."", ""Stock matches have an entirely different feel. Here, death matters, so rushing pell-mell into fights means you're going to end up sad and bruised. So you play with patience. Watch as two players square off, and then fire a shot into the back of your distracted friend. Or wait until that moment after one friend kills another, that second of celebration that invariably comes after a successful fight, and then show why you're the only real samurai of the bunch. Matches where living takes precedence over killing are so deliberate, so full of cunning, that your stress is on the same level as your excitement. The energy builds in your chest, ready to be released in a storm of slashes and blasts, but you must hold back. Taunt your friend, get him to rush at you or stupidly turn his back, and then release the wrath that has been building inside of you. When the match comes to a close, and the scores are tallied up, there may be just one point separating the victor from the losers. In such a situation, there's a showdown. One flat stage, one life, winner takes all. And you thought stock matches were stressful."", ""Are you by your lonesome? There are single-player matches as well that mirror the rhythmic conquests of multiplayer duels. You compete on the same maps with the same attacks as before, and if you forget that you're going against AI foes, you could be tricked into thinking that you're facing off against friends. But it's not the same. That triumphant yell when you best a person next to you, whom you've joked with and plotted against, can't exist when you're sitting by yourself, matching wits with a computer. It's a shame that Samurai Gunn lacks its maniacal edge when played without friends, because there's no online option to take on faraway people. Thankfully, you can take on AI enemies if you don't have three friends nearby, and trying to kill the computer samurais but not each other adds a whole new layer of strategy. And if you must slay alone, you can practice your techniques, and the volatile back and forth is so enticing that you still get lost in the bloody rhythm, but the matches can't live up to the multiplayer escapades."", ""Samurai Gunn revels in its own simplicity. The selectable characters are identical save for their outward appearance, and there are only a handful of moves in your repertoire. There are no unlockable skills, no stages to earn, or any other distractions. And all of that is to this game's benefit. The battles are all that matter, letting you focus entirely on the exciting conquests. When you play with a trio of like-minded friends, everything comes together in such an enticing way that you scream and laugh and taunt and growl until you have to pull away to do other life duties. Samurai Gunn makes excellent use of its simple nature to keep you invested in the bloody life born warrior.""]"Cameron Woolsey,11-Dec-13,Broken Sword 5: The Serpent's Curse Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/broken-sword-5-the-serpent-s-curse-review/1900-6415597/,8,PC,"[""A murdered art gallery owner, a helmeted assassin, and a missing painting.

Broken Sword 5: The Serpent's Curse ushers the return of the franchise's protagonists, along with a host of favorites."", ""It has been quite a while since George and Nico have joined up to solve a case, and in that stretch of time, the two seem to have pursued their own ventures: George has become an agent for an insurance company, and Nico is continuing her career as a globetrotting journalist. But a tragedy strikes, leaving a man murdered for a painting that was worth considerably less than others in the gallery. Since it was George's company that insured the showcase, he feels obligated to uncover the reason behind the theft and find out what makes this painting important enough to kill for. The crime-solving duo are soon reunited and thrust into a murderous conspiracy, armed only with George's astute problem-solving skills and Nico's feminine charm and sharp wit."", ""The story weaves a smart, fascinating, and often humorous tale. George and Nico's latest adventure is fraught with murder, sabotage, and a seedy love affair, with just enough room for an ex-Russian mobster and an assassin or two to be thrown into the mix. You switch between the two characters as they follow a trail that has them trekking through France and London chasing down leads. As you progress, the plot begins to revolve around an age-old conflict between Gnostic and Dominican Christians, and at its epicenter is the painting: La Malediccio. The painting hides more secrets than what can be seen on the surface, and may be the key to an impending epidemic that threatens all life."", ""Broken Sword 5 follows the series' roots as a point-and-click adventure; you use the mouse cursor to control movement as well as to manipulate objects in an area, speak with people, or use items in your inventory to solve a puzzle. Like in many games in the genre, you pick up items and bits of evidence and store them. You use evidence to drag the truth out of people or suspects, while other items, even the most miniscule, such as a paper clip, 1970s cologne, or nail clippers, can be used or combined to solve puzzles down the line."", 'The order in which you procure these items is up to you. At times, you may only have a few clues, leaving you to scour the environment for more evidence necessary to drag information out of your target. Typically, all the evidence required to move the plot along is in your vicinity, if not already on hand. Any and all items in your inventory can be used in a conversation, sometimes to humorous results.', ""The puzzles in Broken Sword 5 are not too strenuous. Most of the time you already have everything in your inventory needed to complete a puzzle; otherwise, a quick hunt around the area yields what you need. The game plays a musical note when you're making progress in a puzzle or in your interrogation, cluing you in on when you're on the right path. The plot doesn't advance until you find every item or piece of evidence in the area, press the right series of switches, or receive an answer to all questions available. But if you do find yourself stumped, there's an optional hint system. The first hint or two gently nudge you in the right direction. If you still come up empty, the final hint presents the puzzle's full solution."", ""The various settings are designed with colorful, hand-painted graphics, and the cel-shaded characters blend effortlessly into the gorgeous scenic backdrops. Though Broken Sword 5 is aesthetically pleasing, it's hard not to notice the stiff and somewhat primitive animations, which are distracting compared to the game's overall beauty. Broken Sword 5's rich and vibrant world is complemented by characters who are interesting, entertaining, and often hilarious. The subtle nuances of their personalities shine through every conversation, and a great vocal cast makes each character believable and memorable."", ""George and Nico's latest adventure is fraught with murder, sabotage, and a seedy love affair."", ""Some of the standout characters include the returning Sergeant Moue, who plays lapdog to the bumbling Inspector Navet. There is also a stereotypically snooty Frenchman who stands guard at an empty cafe while quoting philosophical advice. Also starring are a lecherous art critic and a young man who needs presentation advice for his mobile shop of trinkets and collectibles. The many varied and unique characters reinforce the depth of the game's narrative, and the two protagonists demonstrate a particular chemistry that makes their longtime history feel convincing."", 'You are provided with an in-game map, but Broken Sword 5 keeps aimless wandering down to a minimum. There was never a moment when I stared at the map screen not knowing my next destination. Even when you choose the wrong direction, the game comes up with a reason for you to turn back and try the opposite route. Some adventure game fans may be turned off by the linear focus, but I felt the design allowed the narrative to move with a strong pace and clear direction.', ""Just how deep the rabbit hole goes is the one mystery Broken Sword 5 doesn't shed light on. After about six hours, the game abruptly ends just as things start heating up for our stalwart heroes, leaving more lingering questions and theories than hard answers. The game is the first episode of a two-part adventure, meaning we won't get to the bottom of the conspiracy until sometime early next year."", ""Smart, occasionally funny, and immediately charming, Broken Sword 5: The Serpent's Curse is easy to recommend based on its strong narrative, memorable characters, and artistic merit. The game is a vibrant return to form for the series, and should easily please the series' and point-and-click adventure game fans alike. The answers to the most pivotal questions remain on the horizon, but it's still good to see George and Nico back in action--they have been missed.""]"Heidi Kemps,11-Dec-13,Ys: Memories of Celceta Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ys-memories-of-celceta-review/1900-6415598/,8,PlayStation Vita,"['Ys (pronounced ""ease,"" no apostrophe!) is a legendary, highly influential Japanese action role-playing game franchise with a long, strange history of development and releases, both overseas and abroad. One of the strangest things about the series is that its original developer, Falcom, didn\'t make an Ys IV, instead giving the story concepts to different developers and letting them run with them individually. As a result, there are multiple Ys IVs, but none have been considered a true part of the series. Until now, that is: Falcom decided to make an ""official"" Ys IV as its debut Vita game, calling it Memories of Celceta. The result is one of the best action RPGs yet released on the platform.', 'Celceta puts us back in the shoes of the fiery-haired Ys series hero, Adol. Adol has just wrapped up what seems to be another adventure, but he\'s got a serious problem: he doesn\'t remember any of it. In fact, he doesn\'t remember anything about his life. Fortunately, he runs into an old acquaintance, an ""information dealer"" named Duren, as he\'s recovering at a tavern. With Duren\'s help, he remembers that he is a traveling adventurer who had set out into the great forest of Celceta--uncharted territory that is fabled to consume the memories of those who enter. The pair is offered compensation from the local government if they can create a map of Celceta, but will Adol be able to conquer its dangers again and recover his lost memories in the process?', 'Cleverly designed bosses challenge you with unusual patterns and devastating attacks.', ""The first thing you'll most likely notice about Ys: Memories of Celceta is that it looks dated. The low-resolution character models and textures look more akin to a PSP game than a high-resolution PS Vita game, and the frame rate has an odd tendency to drop at certain points where you wouldn't think the game would be taxing the hardware. Celceta isn't ugly by any stretch--it's refreshingly colorful, has some beautiful settings and architecture, and features very cool character and enemy designs--but it could have looked significantly better. Fortunately, you get over the disappointment of the graphics pretty quickly."", 'Memories of Celceta is an action RPG through and through, and does little to stray from the established formula of that genre. You travel to a town; exit to explore the unfamiliar territory of Celceta; encounter a maze, cave, or dungeon; solve some puzzles; reach another settlement; get plot details and/or a new party recruit; and continue forth. The idea of being asked to map out all of Celceta works well in context, since exploring the various non-town areas is one of the most fun parts of Memories of Celceta. The forest is vast, filled with treasures, artifacts, hidden areas, and natural resources, and the process of finding everything, using newfound abilities to connect areas, and seeing your map gradually expand is immensely satisfying. Ys, as a series, has always used ""the spirit of exploration"" as a motivation for hero Adol, and it\'s nice to see that spirit captured so well. While the ""amnesia as plot impetus"" trope is almost comically overused in games, Celceta manages to do more with it than you might expect. Every so often, the screen grows fuzzy, indicating that a lost memory for Adol is nearby. When he touches the memory, he sees a brief glimpse of his youth or his previous travels. There are hints and stat boosts scattered throughout his fragmented memories, so seeking them all out is beneficial from a story and a gameplay standpoint.', ""Hearing a sweeping synth-rock melody punctuate a flurry of sword strikes, mace combos, and stalagmites exploding into a shower of loot is a delightful event that you'll experience countless times."", 'But the wilderness is also teeming with creatures, all of which view Adol and company as a threat. Almost every area has a pack of vicious beasts to beat down. Thankfully, combat is one of the best parts of Celceta. Long gone is the antiquated early Ys combat that had you running into enemies and hoping for the best; it has been replaced by more traditional combat that is fantastically fast, skillful, and highly rewarding.', ""A team of up to three of your party members can be onfield at any time, and they all participate in combat. You control one of these characters while the CPU handles the other two. You've got a pretty solid arsenal: basic combo strings you can use to pummel enemies, charged attacks you can store by not pressing attack buttons for a few seconds, and Tales-style special attacks that cost skill points (which you recover by using basic strikes). While there isn't a magic system, some characters' special skills make use of attacks like fiery explosions and gravity spheres. Instead of the typical RPG elemental weakness/resistance, enemies have vulnerabilities and resistances to striking, piercing, and slashing physical attacks. Since every character wields only one weapon type, you may find yourself wanting to switch whom you control when you run up against a group of foes with a weak point to exploit or a pattern that makes certain weapons more advantageous."", ""Foes aren't just going to sit back and take your punishment, though, and they can perform some pretty nasty attacks that take you down if you play carelessly. Dodging and guarding are as easy as a button press, but performing them with perfect timing yields additional rewards: dodging at the right time slows the enemy down for a precious few seconds, while a well-executed flash guard not only nullifies damage, but guarantees a few critical hits afterward. Finishing off enemies with skills and using their weaknesses against them also results in greater rewards upon their defeat. Combat in Celceta is easy to understand and fun to engage in, and it rewards you for playing well, but it's not a total cakewalk. Some enemies are made to give and withstand punishment, leaving you to decide whether it's worth the risk to engage them or not, and the cleverly designed bosses challenge you with unusual patterns and devastating attacks, and you must employ less obvious strategies to take them down."", 'The forest is vast, filled with treasures, artifacts, hidden areas, and natural resources.', ""There's a lot to love about Memories of Celceta: the thrill of exploring, the rush of combat, and the trademark Falcom synth-rockin' soundtrack. The complaints that can be levied against it are fairly minor: the visuals aren't so hot, your teammate AI can be questionable at times, and there are a few frustrating spots, such as a sequence where you must dodge instant-kill lightning bolts in a field. But perhaps the biggest complaint could be its relative lack of innovation: when it comes right down to it, there really isn't much new here. Celceta is a fairly standard action RPG that takes many of the best elements of the genre and assembles them into a single terrfic game. Those elements are assembled quite skillfully, but everything you've seen in Memories of Celceta--even nonessential features like weapon enhancement and side quests you accept at town pubs--is something you've probably encountered before. If you've only heard of Ys as an amazing, genre-defining classic series (which it most certainly was when it first hit the scene), you might find yourself disappointed at how familiar the gameplay and story progression are."", ""Taken strictly on its own merits, however, Ys: Memories of Celceta is a wonderful adventure. It's great fun to wander in the forests and dungeons, bashing foes and finding lost treasures to uncover ancient secrets. Hearing a sweeping synth-rock melody punctuate a flurry of sword strikes, mace combos, and stalagmites exploding into a shower of loot is a delightful event that you'll experience countless times in the journey through the mysterious forest. Memories of Celceta is an adventure well worth embarking on for any Vita owner."", ' ']"Brittany Vincent,11-Dec-13,Tiny Brains Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tiny-brains-review/1900-6415592/,5,PS4,"[""Given the relative dearth of absorbing cooperative journeys for modern adventurers, Tiny Brains is an appealing consideration, asking as it does for you to lean on your friends in-house or across the country to solve its various conundrums. It's unfortunate, then, that this is a game you'll complete on your own in a matter of hours, possibly even quicker when you bring friends along for the ride. Tiny Brains' colorful assortment of cartoony rodents makes the game momentarily interesting, but Tiny Brains quickly spirals into a repetitive mixture of similar puzzles."", 'Jump into the bodies acting as vessels for the titular ""tiny brains"": Minsc, a blue hamster; Stew, the rabbit; Dax, the bat; and a mouse named Pad. You don\'t need to rely on remembering their names so much as their telekinetic powers, which are put to good use as you lead the troupe of creatures away from the evil scientist who wants to continue conducting experiments on them. Minsc can summon forth blocks of ice, Dax can push items, Stew can pull items, and Pad can swap positions with other set pieces. To escape to freedom, they must work together, combining their powers to break out of the nefarious ""fortresses"" of the scientist\'s facility.', ""You can play alone, swapping between each animal as necessary, or enlist the help of friends to see you through trying quandaries. Fortunately, there are a set of reliable maneuvers to fall back on here and there in order to progress. While this cuts down on the amount of confusion you might feel when playing alone, if you enlist friends for the ride, things undoubtedly become predictable as you continually implement the same strategies over and over. An earmark of a great puzzler is the perpetual exhibition of brand-new challenges, and while fun in bursts, Tiny Brains doesn't deliver in that regard."", ""There's plenty of fun to be had, especially with a group of friends to control the various animals. It just doesn't last."", ""For instance, you might need to move a battery to the other side of a passageway or manipulate balls that float along in the air. You might need to use the hamster's ability to create a block of ice to reach a higher ledge, and then use another rodent to stand on top of it in order to travel to the other side of a prolonged gap. A battery could wait at the other side of the gap, so you might choose to teleport with the mouse to reach it or try an alternative method to complete your objective. Then, at some point in one of that level's four areas, you might be asked to repeat a similar maneuver in a different order. It's not always batteries or floating balls--you're faced with a multitude of roadblocks that the mad scientist has set up to deter the Tiny Brains crew from escaping--but you often know what's coming and how to best approach it, removing an important element of surprise that enables you to keep chugging along and recharges you to keep you ready for each subsequent puzzle."", ""There's still fun to be had, especially with a group of friends to control the various animals. It just doesn't last. You also face off against an army of chickens that cluck about, conveniently in the way of what you're doing at the moment, be it moving blocks or pulling items, so you need to smash them. It's violent, yes, but it's one of the only ways to take care of them so you can go about your business. They play a larger role in the game later on, but by then, Tiny Brains is content to all but fizzle out, having exhausted its supply of rollicking brain teasers early on before it can properly mix the chickens and other elements into the fold."", ""The slow, deliberate movements of each character while you're controlling and swapping between each member of the team can be frustrating, especially with segments that require speedier response times than others. The action also seems to be at odds with a capricious accompanying soundtrack that sounds as though it's mocking you when you fail to progress during a puzzle. It's unobtrusive for the most part, but when you're stumped, a rollicking tune isn't exactly what you want to hear."", ""A two-hour story mode isn't much to come back to over and over, but the game's life is extended by the Tiny Trolls and Jules modes. Jules mode lets you take control of a new character with one life, and you're forced to control all four powers at once. Tiny Trolls transforms each level into a tug-of-war battle that's best enjoyed with friends. This mode is highly entertaining, especially if you've got a group of friends to invite for the purposes of wreaking absolute havoc on each other. Tiny Trolls turns into a Worms-esque battle royale from there, which makes for a rowdy good time. Alternatively, you can opt for Tiny Soccer or various challenges, which can tack on an additional few hours of content if you take your time. Overall, this isn't a purchase with much longevity, which you should consider if you're looking to add Tiny Brains to your budding PS4 library."", ""Tiny Brains might look adorable, but its short length and lack of imaginative puzzles will turn your wide grin into a questioning smirk. However, if you're dying for a weekend's worth of solo or cooperative puzzle-solving, Tiny Brains is serviceable--though more tiny than brainy.""]"Cameron Woolsey,10-Dec-13,Vector Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/vector-review/1900-6415596/,7,PC,"['The desire for freedom is common in stories in which control and oppression are law. In Vector, you play as a man in an Orwellian dystopia, no longer able to bend to the will of his masters. He casts aside his mind-control device, and apparently his shirt, and leaps from his skyscraper prison, sprinting across rooftops toward the distant horizon.', 'Vector is a celebration of artistic freestyle running, where you are awarded for pulling off parkour tricks such as barrel-rolling over edges or spinning through the air over office desks. This free-running platformer relies on expert timing to vault over--or slide under--obstacles, leap into the air, and wall jump, all the while being chased by a hunter displaying similar athletic prowess. The characters are stark black silhouettes that stand out cleanly against the gorgeously rendered urban backgrounds.', ""Vector's protagonist and his pursuer are beautifully animated and demonstrate realistic grace as they nimbly vault over objects. The goal of the game is to navigate each stage to a safe zone, before your pursuer catches up. The game is brimming with exciting moments. Your pursuer creates an inherent and constant sense of danger as you move through a stage. Leaping off high-rises into the air as doves dart out of your way like in a scene from a John Woo film, all to the rhythm of a pulse-pounding soundtrack, is an adrenaline-charged thrill."", ""Hitting an action key at the wrong time yields dire consequences. Mistiming can cause a momentary disruption in pace, forcing you to stumble and slow down as you struggle to regain footing, allowing your burly pursuer the opportunity to close the gap. As the hunter draws near, the camera zooms in, and deadly electricity arcs from his gauntlets, vigorously increasing the tension. In these moments, the game demands all of your focus, because one false move means the end of your shirtless dash to freedom. You get a rush of relief and satisfaction upon reaching the goal when death is so near, and seeing the exasperation on the hunter's face as the door that seals your safety slams down makes your victory all the sweeter."", ""Your performance in a stage is rewarded in stars. Surviving until the end earns you one star, but to gather all three, you must perform every trick in the stage as well as collect all the floating bonus cubes scattered across the level. Stars and the occasional coin grant in-game currency you can exchange for tricks, which can be purchased just before the level starts. Also available for purchase in the in-game store is the force blaster, which temporarily stops the hunter, giving you some much-needed breathing room. But even with the weapon, it's still all on you to maneuver through the stage with expert precision in order to nab that three-star rating. One major slipup, and it's back to the start minus one potentially life-saving item. You can also buy clothing items such as a hat or a scarf, if you're into accessorizing. Later stages branch out into multiple paths. While all given paths eventually lead you to safety, only one includes every trick and bonus. Practice and exploration are highly encouraged, and it may take multiple replays to discover and master the best route."", ""The game is short, and can be completed in around three hours. However, there are plenty of reasons to jump back into Vector. Levels generally take only minutes to finish, making quick visits to nab stars during breaks appealing. Collecting stars unlocks difficult bonus missions that test your parkour skills to the limit. To progress through the stages, you need to collect stars to unlock two of the game's main sections. The number of stars necessary to unlock these areas is high, meaning you need to purchase many tricks and master multiple stages just to proceed. In time, earning the necessary stars to increase currency and purchase moves becomes a slow grind. Mistakes get frustrating, and the game soon has you pounding away at the restart key, sometimes even moments after starting a stage. But when everything goes right, Vector is a fast-paced joyride that earns your attention.""]"Britton Peele,10-Dec-13,Darkout Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/darkout-review/1900-6415594/,5,PC,"[""The world of Darkout is not inviting. Everything is bathed in darkness, monsters roam freely, and your initial resources are scarce. Worse, though, is the initial hump you must get over just to come to grips with confusing menus, a bad tutorial, and crafting systems that aren't explained--and all for a 2D sandbox game that feels overfamiliar."", ""It's hard not to compare Darkout to Terraria when the influences are so obvious. So many of the elements, especially early on, are the same click for click. After crash-landing on a procedurally generated world, you are instructed to chop some wood and use that wood to build a shelter (complete with blocks, background walls, and a door). Then you are told to craft a bed (where you respawn if you die) and are invited to take your axe, shovel, and pickaxe to explore the world and all the resources it has to offer. Stop me if this sounds familiar, and I won't have to go into detail about the islands floating in the sky or the fact that torches can be your best friends in caves."", 'It\'s tempting to simply write, ""Here are the ways Darkout and Terraria are the same. Here are the ways in which they\'re different."" This is because Darkout doesn\'t do quite enough to differentiate itself, making it harder to discuss Darkout as its own entity. But at least it tries. Darkout is, as you might guess, a much darker game in both tone and aesthetic.', ""Of course, this is far from the first game to clone the success that was Terraria (which you could say was itself a 2D clone of Minecraft), but it doesn't help that Darkout makes a bad first impression. For the first hour at least, I couldn't shake the feeling that Darkout's best elements were borrowed and that the game they were borrowed from did everything better. With a few wrong clicks, you can accidentally toss or squander resources that are imperative for your early survival, especially if you happen to miss the small window of tutorial text that awkwardly (and poorly) teaches you the basics. As the game teaches you how to craft items, you have to deal with inconvenient and hard-to-use menu sliders, making it difficult to choose the exact number of items you want. There isn't even any music to properly set the mood."", 'The excitement of ""What will I discover next?"" is diminished when you know the answer is something like ""More dark, rocky environments.""', ""Fortunately, there are some elements of Darkout that immediately feel well-thought-out and well-executed, chief among them being a single item on your hotbar that automatically uses the appropriate tools when you're exploring. With this selected, you never have to manually switch to your axe to chop a tree and then to your shovel to dig at the spot where it was. Tools are automatically used based on where your cursor is, which is a terrific time-saver."", ""Unlike many 2D sandbox games that leave you to your own devices (Terraria included), Darkout tries to add a sense of purpose to this formula with the introduction of a story. While exploring, you might find data logs hinting at the world's disastrous past or warning you of danger that lurks in the dark. You might also get a few hints about what to do next, starting with deploying a distress beacon. Sadly, this story is easy to ignore, even on accident. Close a text box before looking at it closely enough, and you might spend a dozen hours not realizing there is a story at all, much less anything resembling a goal or quest. So what could have been one of Darkout's bigger differentiators instead becomes something that doesn't matter at all. It's executed too poorly to make you care."", 'So you spend hours upon hours exploring, mostly mining the same materials and fighting the same enemies wherever you go. Even on a ""small"" world, different environments are far apart with few things of interest in between, and many look too similar to each other. The excitement of ""What will I discover next?"" is diminished when you know the answer is something like ""More dark, rocky environments."" And don\'t bother diving deep into the large oceans you may find, because there is nothing in them. The developers say they\'re planning more environments for a future update, but right now there is too little variety.', 'The one area where Darkout tries to innovate most is research. Beyond simply crafting materials, you can spend resources and points (earned by exploring, collecting, and crafting) on new items and technologies via a research tab. Researching new light sources is especially important, because enemies are more vulnerable to your attacks when exposed to light. Of course, advanced lights demand power, so you soon find yourself researching wires and sockets so you can power up your buildings in true high-tech fashion. Like the rest of the game, wiring can be needlessly confusing at first, but it can also be incredibly satisfying when everything comes together in a base that feels futuristic. Crafting becomes more interesting when you create objects like elevators and jetpacks.', ""The thing is, for as many flaws as it has and as mundane as many parts of it can be, I found myself hating the game less at hour 12 than I did at hour two. Once I had mastered the controls and gotten a grasp of the crafting and research systems, I started getting excited about what I might be able to build next. New suits were particularly enticing goals to work toward, because their ability to give off their own light made exploring below the surface much more efficient and enjoyable. I started to take more pride in my base, which was slowly being converted from a wooden shack to a sci-fi lab of copper walls and titanium doors. The more I invested, the more Darkout offered, and after 20 hours, I still haven't built every item and read every data log. The content is there; it's just awkwardly spaced."", 'But for as many hours as you can spend with (and enjoy) Darkout, too many elements are incomplete. There are even items with flavor text that simply reads ""Coming soon!"" It\'s great to know more content is coming, but it\'s needed now.', ""Lots of little annoyances add up to make Darkout less than than the sum of its influences, though they're not enough to ruin the entire experience. Once you're over the initial hump, there are things to like about the game, and it's clear the developers are digging toward something more ambitious than is initially available. Hopefully more light can shine on the good parts in the future, because right now too much of the experience is just too dim.""]"Shaun McInnis,10-Dec-13,Doki-Doki Universe Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/doki-doki-universe-review/1900-6415593/,7,PS4,"['At various points throughout Doki-Doki Universe, you might find yourself flying through space on a wedge of Swiss cheese, blowing kisses at a hulking sumo wrestler, or resolving a dispute between a toilet and a magical tree. But beneath that absurdist veneer lies a story of surprising warmth and emotional resonance. This is a simple game that tackles heavy themes, using its whimsical humor to extol the virtues of empathy in an earnest and entertaining way.', ' ', ""That goofy charm is immediately apparent in the game's vibrant art style. Doki-Doki Universe is a middle school textbook sprung to life, all doodles of stick figures and dragons and anthropomorphized carrots. It's a playful 2D aesthetic where adorable animals and winged beasts made of poo exist side by side, disarming you with its whimsy before revealing its broader narrative ambitions."", ' ', ""That story revolves around QT3, an oblivious little robot with problems connecting to those around him. As if being socially awkward weren't bad enough, QT3 is facing the prospect of being discontinued by the company that created him. That is, unless he can learn enough about humanity--the game's shorthand for understanding others--to prove his worth as a household companion."", ' ', ""Thus begins your journey through the bizarre world of Doki-Doki Universe. You're free to travel between any of the game's 20+ planets, getting to know the oddball residents that populate these worlds as you help them out with favors large and small. The medieval fantasy planet of Gunite is home to a princess who longs for a spaceship to leave her pampered life behind, for instance, while the undersea world of Aquariumland houses a giant sea monster who's ostracized purely because of his looks (his name is Matthew and he secretly loves to dance). Other worlds are full of equally bizarre characters: talking sushi rolls who are terrified of being eaten, a penguin couple looking to put the spark back in their relationship, and a bunny suffering from crippling self-esteem issues. There's a huge breadth of personalities for you to interact with, each encounter brought to life by sharp dialogue and a strong undercurrent of eccentric humor."", ' ', ""Indeed, simply talking to people is a big part of Doki-Doki Universe. There's a real focus on breaking down barriers, using conversation to reveal the human qualities behind those screwball caricatures. You might greet these strangers with their favorite gesture (some people like a nice wave, while others are fond of blowing kisses) before chatting with them to find out what their likes and dislikes are. Some are forthcoming with that information, while others play it so close to the vest that you'll need to find out about them through the proverbial grapevine."", ' ', ""That knowledge is important, because in order to really win people over you need to ply them with gifts. The game's inventory system adds a light puzzle element by giving QT3 the ability to summon various objects out of thin air. This system is generally flexible, letting you choose from a broad selection of objects for a given task. Does King Pink on the planet of Gunite want food for a party he's throwing in his own honor? No need for a massive spread; he'll think a bottle of ketchup is the most exotic thing in the world. You know that kangaroo in need of a shelter for his pet humans? Sure you could give him a regal castle, but a burning building surrounded by firefighters will do the trick just as well. There's a lot of room to goof around when it comes to gift-giving, and seeing everyone's wide-eyed responses is almost always a delight. It can be tedious when the game calls for something specific and you have to go hunting through the clunky inventory system, but fortunately, those issues are quite rare."", ""There's a huge breadth of personalities for you to interact with, each encounter brought to life by sharp dialogue and a strong undercurrent of eccentric humor."", ""It's a clever, self-propagating system: the more you get to know characters, the more they'll open up to you and reward you with gifts, thereby expanding your options for winning over other characters on different planets throughout the universe. On top of that, you can always return to your home planet and use those objects to decorate the place however you wish. Viking ships and mariachi bands? Sure. Killer robots and adorable penguins? You're the designer here."", ' ', ""Merely pressing the X button to begin a conversation is about as much of a challenge as you'll find in all of this, which can make Doki-Doki Universe drag on as you sink more and more time into it. But there's a touching quality to those interactions that makes you want to continue exploring each strange new planet. Beneath those quirky exteriors are universal themes like bullying, lost loves, and the dangers of marginalization. You enter worlds in turmoil and leave behind smiling, appreciative faces using little more than communication and generosity. You get the sense that QT3 is learning about humanity because, in some small way, so are you."", ' ', ""That's good, because Doki-Doki Universe doesn't offer much overarching sense of progression outside of new unlockables like costumes and flying mounts. Its freeform structure means you're free to travel wherever you like and chat with anyone you take a fancy to, but it's hard to feel like you're working toward any tangible end state."", ' ', 'A better sense of progression can be found in the game\'s abundance of quiz asteroids. These are ostensibly designed to gauge QT3\'s progress in learning about humanity, but in practice they\'re there more for you to have a laugh at yourself over the course of a few dozen humorous quizzes. A typical example presents a ludicrous image of a bulldozer fighting a giant wine glass, asking you whose side you\'d take in the fight. Choose the wine glass and the game explains how you\'ve chosen idealism over security, selecting the clear underdog because you\'re the type to ""fight for what you believe in even if it means you will probably lose."" Do enough of these quizzes and you can return to your home planet to get a broader evaluation of your personality, which more often than not tends to be an eerily accurate encapsulation of your chosen play style.', ' ', ""And yet, even as a bearded stick figure named Doctor Therapist describes your inner-psyche in thorough detail, Doki-Doki Universe never feels heavy-handed. It guides you along with a light touch, wrapping its warmhearted message in layer after layer of absurdity and humor.

Such experiences are rare in games. Then again, there's nothing commonplace about Doki-Doki Universe.""]"Daniel Starkey,10-Dec-13,Two Brothers Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/two-brothers-review/1900-6415595/,7,PC,"[""Two Brothers is one of the oddest games I've played in a while. As a game touting fairly accurate Game Boy-era monochromatic visuals, it exists as a curious pastiche of Zelda, Final Fantasy, and countless other classics. It takes for granted that you're familiar with their aesthetics and constantly plays off of those expectations to create an unnerving second look at life, death, and the magic of that which we can't fully explain."", ""Roy Guarder and his brother, Braville, are the eponymous protagonists. In the first few moments, Roy and his wife die on an expedition in the Cursed Lands. Roy crosses into the afterlife, where he experiences color for the very first time before being told that it's not his time to die yet. He's dropped back into the mortal world with a sort of tempered fatalism, and a new life goal: to discover the source and the nature of color. It's a jarring sequence specifically because Two Brothers plays itself off as just an average-looking Game Boy game in all of its sepia-tone glory."", ""Much like with the Game Boy, you have only four buttons and some movement controls to do everything. Besides select, which opens up your item bag, you have one projectile attack and one melee attack. The game also auto-saves at every screen transition, so start only pauses; it doesn't bring up any sort of menu. It's all very straightforward. That said, many puzzles push those limited mechanics as far as they can possibly go. For example, while picking things up and carrying them isn't possible until you get an item bag, you can push people to different places to trigger new events. And shooting arrows can trigger switches and in some cases cause you to switch places with a block, allowing you to cross gaps or reach new areas."", 'This is a game that ruthlessly jerks back and forth between helping you empathize with and embody Roy and utterly confusing you as to just how this world, or any gameworld, really works.', ""Unfortunately, that cleverness doesn't always work out. The combat isn't on par with the puzzles. Some ways into the game you're introduced to combos and power attacks, neither of which amounts to anything substantial. Occasionally, bombs and other objects enter the mix, allowing you to set up some devastating ambush attacks, but the AI is too terrible to do anything more than wander around aimlessly. Enemies don't rigorously pursue you, and I recall an entire boss fight that I won simply by using the power attack over and over again and waiting for the boss to impale itself on my blade. The best battles add bits of puzzle here and there, but this tendency often goes too far the other way. Some puzzle bosses are unforgiving in terms of where you need to be and when. Combat can come across as a bit of a mess at times, and it goes a decent way to reminding us all why turn-based combat was so common in the early days. It allowed for a lot of options and strategy that rudimentary controls couldn't bring to real-time play."", ""Besides the haphazard attempt at combat, mechanically Two Brothers doesn't do much to shake up the conventions of 8-bit game design. Instead, its real innovation is in its writing, world, and story. This is a game that requires some fluency with older games. Throughout, Two Brothers relies heavily on your understanding of tropes and cliches of the late '80s and early '90s. For example, in the Zelda series, cutting down enemies or grass with your sword often caused hearts to pop out. These could be picked up to restore a small amount of health. Two Brothers does the same thing, but instead of being heart-shaped video game power-ups, hearts here are actual, physical hearts--blood and all--that you eat to gain power. The game is brutally self-aware, and while complete fourth-wall breaks aren't common, it tends toward this strange approach to pseudo-realism that attempts to play all of its bizarre quirks completely straight."", 'The total package is often unnerving. One moment has Roy crossing paths with a stranger that refuses to identify himself. Several times, the unknown man causes the screen to glitch and reset. Roy\'s memory was never fully wiped, however, and his growing confusion and anger closely matched my own. Later, an ancient, sacred beast trusts Roy simply because his name is Guarder, which sounds a little like ""guardian."" This is a game that ruthlessly jerks back and forth between helping you empathize with and embody Roy and utterly confusing you as to just how this world, or any gameworld, really works. As uncomfortable as it all sounds, it really works.', ""Two Brothers never gets so bogged down in its witticisms that it becomes a game about games, but it does trigger a lot of questions about the nature of death and how we value life. There is a message here, and while the world itself is jittery and frenetic, the theme doesn't get lost in all the weirdness."", ""Where this weirdness does sometimes break down, though, is in the game's actual glitches and bugs. Because Two Brothers tries too hard to be subversive and odd, it's not always clear when the game is broken or when you're just not understanding what's happening. For instance, the second time I started up the game, I began to float above the world unable to interact with or do anything. It was weird, but it was very similar to the scene where Roy first ascends to the afterlife. I couldn't tell what was going on, and I ended up spending about an hour trying to look for clues before frustration set in and I gave up. The next time I started up the game, everything worked as normal. I didn't notice any severe bugs beyond that one, though I sometimes found myself moving through walls to other areas, but I couldn't control it or find any pattern to it."", ""Even without the bugs, Two Brothers could definitely use another round of editing. There are a number of typos and graphical oddities that can take you out of the moment from time to time. It's possible that they could all be part of the pastiche aesthetic, referring to poorly translated games of yesteryear, but that's never made clear, and given my experience with bugs, I was more ready to attribute them to carelessness than purpose."", ""When Two Brothers works, when it lines up whole scenes that bounce between funny, disturbing, and touching, it shows just how powerful the ideas it's working with are. The human experience is one that's dominated by our fear of death, our pursuit of love, and the belief that the world, more or less, makes sense. But what if death was really the secret to life? What if we didn't love what we thought we did? What if the world only makes sense because we're delusional? These are fun questions, and they are deep ones that we'll all probably wrestle with at one point or another, and mediocre combat and bugs aside, they're subjects that Ackk Studios manages to treat with a surprising amount of respect, bringing with them a clever twist on the tropes we expect to see.""]"Joseph Barron,10-Dec-13,Gran Turismo 6 Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/gran-turismo-6-review/1900-6415589/,7,PS3,"[""Gran Turismo 6 can be a wonderful thing. It's hard not to admire its intuitive handling, the obsessive attention to detail, and its steadfast dedication to simulation, even though some of the fun is sucked out in the process. It's an impressive piece of work in some respects, but for a series with such a legacy behind it, you can't help but feel it's forever doomed to a life of quiet predictability to keep the diehards happy. GT6 is all about small, incremental changes over grand reinventions. While it is--in my mind at least--the best true racing simulation available on consoles, so much of the game feels antiquated and quaint when compared to its rivals. Everything that's good about Gran Turismo is here, and so too, unfortunately, is the bad."", ""Things start off well, though. GT6 gets you straight into the action with a Trackday lap--a first for the series--by putting you at the wheel of a Renault Clio RS at the new Brands Hatch circuit. There, you're taught driving basics, such as how to use a racing line and zip around the track. The pacey Renault isn't going to smash any lap records, but it's great fun to drive, and the Trackday certainly gets you geared up for some proper racing. And then, as soon as the tutorial is over, Polyphony Digital falls back into 15 years of horribly bad habits."", ' ', 'Powerful supercars still sound like lawnmowers and hairdryers.', ""Career mode begins without even giving you a choice of your first car; you're forced into the tepid Honda Fit for around the first 90 minutes of the game. Progress is slow, with credits being handed out at a paltry rate early on, and you're rarely rewarded with new vehicles for race wins. The first vehicle you unlock without having to spend any of your hard-earned credits is only a go-kart. Gran Turismo purists will probably be expecting this kind of grind, but newcomers will quickly be alienated by GT6 when other racing games are happy to put you behind the wheel of a kickass sports car within minutes."", ""Progress through your career is gated by a new star system and by the traditional GT license tests. There are six categories of races, each requiring a certain number of stars to unlock. Once you have enough stars to unlock the next category, you then have to complete a series of license tests. It's a long, drawn-out process that feels very old-fashioned. If you've played a lot of racing games, then the license tests are completely pointless; not everyone needs to learn how to drive from scratch with each new GT game. The fact that the tests are now mandatory again after being optional in GT5 is a total kick in the teeth."", ""GT6 maintains the series' famous variety of models and events, and adds to its heritage in meaningful ways."", ""Thankfully, your progress isn't further hindered by the user interface as it was in GT5. The menus are a vast improvement over the previous game's muddled design, borrowing heavily from the tiled layout of Microsoft's Metro UI. Everything from buying and upgrading cars, to Career mode, online play, and community features is accessed from a single screen. It sounds like a simple upgrade, but compared to GT5, it's light years ahead."", ""GT6's handling is nearly flawless. The updates to the driving model seem subtle at first, but the little tweaks combine to make vast improvements. Cars spring to life, demanding precision and concentration from even the most experienced drivers. The changes to the physics are the claimed result of partnerships with several automotive parts makers, from aftermarket suspension companies to tire manufacturers. The suspension modeling is the most immediately noticeable change. You can feel the body roll and yaw as you change direction, making it natural and instinctive to correct tiny slides as you sense the car's weight shifting, rather than relying on visual feedback."", ""Stock road cars are livelier too. In the past, they had very neutral and unresponsive handling, but in GT6, you can sense much more movement through these less-high-end machines, particularly when the nose dives down toward the asphalt under heavy braking. You can anticipate the limit of grip even on standard street tires, giving the best drivers the opportunity to extract more performance than usual from slow cars. That might all sound intimidating, particularly if you're not a seasoned driver, but there's a whole suite of assists that keep GT6's realistic physics accessible to less-skilled players. Traction control and other settings have 10-point sliders that can be adjusted gradually as you improve your driving, starting you off with basic control and easing you into a more realistic experience."", ""However, while the driving is executed beautifully, there are other areas of the GT6 experience that fare less well. New circuits like Brands Hatch, Bathurst, Goodwood, and Ascari all look superb, but older tracks are sorely in need of a fresh coat of paint. Some of the environment art leaves a lot to be desired too, and is in danger of falling far behind the rest of the racing pack. Many of the grandstands are filled with cardboard-cutout fans, and some locations have some horrible-looking trees and rock textures that look like they haven't been updated since GT4 on the PlayStation 2. Rain effects are disappointing too, with water falling from the sky in jagged lines, and spray from cars looking like a decal glued to the back of each vehicle."", ""Night racing, on the other hand, is spectacular, with gorgeous lighting and detailed star-filled skies. There is, however, an unfortunate side effect to the entire simulation: the frame rate. It's stable most of the time, but it suffers on some of the more detailed courses, and load times are inconsistent too."", ""Then there are the differences between the cars. The hotly debated issue of premium versus standard cars that was a big problem with GT5 was supposed to have been solved for GT6. In practice, the situation has improved, but it's far from resolved. For the most part, cars are stunning, both inside and out, but on the track, you can definitely tell which of them are updated versions of GT5's standard models. These cars have lower-resolution textures and significantly fewer polygons in addition to their featureless black cockpits."", ""In a weird twist, GT6 no longer separates standard and premium cars on the dealership screens. This can lead to spending your hard-earned credits on a new ride, only to get onto the circuit and find that it looks jagged and blurry next to the other pristine cars. Car audio is still a problem too. This is one of the worst parts of the series' long legacy and is crying out to be updated. Powerful supercars still sound like lawnmowers and hairdryers. Changes have been promised for future patches, but at the moment, the audio has been lapped by the competition."", 'The AI needs a big upgrade as well. Despite promised improvements, Gran Turismo 6 feels much the same as past GT games. Opponents adhere to a rigid racing line, behaving more like slot cars than real racers. They show almost no awareness of either you or the other AI drivers, clumsily turning into other cars, stamping on the brakes way too early, and failing to power out of corners. In this regard, GT6 feel hugely dated in comparison to its competition and sucks the fun out of the racing. The driving itself is hugely enjoyable and rewarding, but racing with the AI is more like an elaborate obstacle course than a motorsport event.', ""If you want some competitive racing, you need to head into the online lobbies. Multiplayer racing can be a minefield at the best of times, and GT6 similarly makes getting into a race an awkward process. For some reason, the day-one patch removed the Quick Match option from the menus, meaning that the only way to race is to scour pages and pages of custom lobbies until you find one that you like. Users can flag events as racing for fun, for realism, or for drifting, but that's about as helpful as it gets. Icons show you whether a lobby restricts assists or car performance, but there's nothing to tell you which assists will be locked out, or exactly how car performance is restricted. You're left with no choice but to connect to a game and hope for the best. This is yet another area where Polyphony Digital promised big changes from GT5 but has failed to deliver."", ""Despite its many problems, GT6 still has vast appeal for gearheads and car collectors. Polyphony Digital claims that the game has more than 1,200 cars, so there are plenty of new machines to experience and customize. The possibilities for automotive customization have been dramatically expanded in GT6 with huge amounts of visual upgrades available. There are dozens of wings and other aerodynamic enhancements and hundreds of wheel designs, but sadly, no options for custom painting. On the mechanical side, the tuning shop has been significantly streamlined, making it much easier to see the effects of each new part before you spend your credits, although there's still no way to share setups with other players."", 'So much of the game feels antiquated and quaint when compared to its rivals.', ""As well as the sheer number of cars, GT6 maintains the series' famous variety of models and events, and adds to its heritage in meaningful ways. In a first for the series, the game includes a long list of European racing cars from the FIA GT3 class, so you can take to the track in the ultimate versions of the world's most desirable cars, like the Mercedes-Benz SLS-AMG GT3 and the Audi R8 GT3. There are more Le Mans prototypes than ever before in a GT game too, and rally makes a welcome return, albeit with no new dirt courses. Polyphony is promising plenty of cars and tracks to come, much of it via free downloadable content, including the Vision GT cars, which are unique concepts developed by the world's top carmakers specifically for Gran Turismo."", ""Unfortunately, if you want to build up a big car collection, you're going to need either a lot of spare time or a lot of spare cash. GT6 is designed to reward its most dedicated fans by keeping the very best cars exclusive. Classic racing cars have high credit price tags, meaning that you're going to have to grind out a lot of career events to afford them. In GT5, you could get around this by taking part in the weekly updated seasonal events, which differed little from Career races but offered massive payouts, sometimes upward of half a million credits. In GT6, the first batch of seasonal events offer a top prize of only 12,500 credits. This leaves the newly introduced microtransactions as the only option for busy players to acquire the best cars. One million credits cost 7.99, but the most expensive cars in the game are worth around 20 million credits, costing upward of 100 in real money. Spending money is entirely optional, and you have to actively go looking for the store to do so, but the choice to add microtransactions instead of addressing the grind leaves a bad taste in the mouth."", ""GT6 takes another bizarre turn in the game's Special Events. These side missions place you in specific cars and locations with unique tasks. My favorite of these is the Goodwood Hill Climb, which puts you behind the wheel of a variety of classic cars at this famous British motorsport festival, and is a neat bit of nostalgic fun. At the other end of the spectrum is the gimmicky lunar exploration task. That's right, you can drive on the moon. In this event, you drive supposedly accurate lunar rover missions from the 1970s. These are slow, tedious events that are only remarkable for the setting and the fleeting novelty of driving in low gravity."", ""Career mode also features optional coffee break events designed to add more variety to the racing format of the single-player game. These are usually drifting challenges or cone challenges in which you have to knock over a certain number of cones in a given time. They're more of a pleasant distraction than a meaningful addition, but they break up the pace nicely."", 'The rest of the presentation is pure Gran Turismo, for better and for worse. The music is the now-notorious mixture of lounge jazz and heavy metal, and none of the game is voiced, so you read a lot of text tutorials in the early going. Other areas have been given a bit more attention. Races are introduced with some cool TV-style graphics with details about weather conditions, temperatures, and starting grids, which creates a nice sense of atmosphere that has been missing from previous GT games. Damage, on the other hand, has not been changed at all since GT5. The vast majority of cars show barely any damage. Even 100mph head-on collisions cause only tiny dents and scrapes, and they have no impact on car handling or performance.', ""It's those little niggles that make Gran Turismo 6 feel so incredibly dated compared to its rivals. Yes, it's nice to have that attention to detail poured into the physics simulation itself, but when the likes of Forza are heaping on the features, it's hard not to feel shortchanged by GT6's lack of vision. Maybe we'll see the makeover the series sorely needs when it inevitably hits the PS4, but until then, Gran Turismo 6 remains a fantastic simulation; it's just not a great game.""]"Carolyn Petit,10-Dec-13,The Novelist Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-novelist-review/1900-6415591/,7,PC,"[""Things are never as simple as they should be. The Kaplans have come to a secluded house in the Pacific Northwest for a summer getaway--a chance for Dan to focus on his book, for Linda to reignite her painting career, for the two of them to work on their marriage, and for their son Tommy to make some progress in coping with his learning difficulties. That's an awful lot for a family to tackle over the course of a single summer, and as it turns out, for the Kaplans as for many real families, not everyone can have all their needs met all the time."", ""The Novelist doesn't hold together as well as you'd hope, but the challenging situations the Kaplans find themselves in, and the burden of having to decide how the Kaplans respond to those challenges, make it a gripping game that causes you to reflect on the often-competing forces that are at play in our real-world relationships, and the difficulty (if not the impossibility) of finding a successful balance that's fair to everyone involved."", 'You impact the lives of the Kaplans not as a member of the family, but as a ghostly presence who inhabits the house they\'ve rented for the summer. There are two difficulty settings in The Novelist, ""stealth"" and ""story."" If you select stealth, you can be seen by the Kaplans as they wander about the house, and spooking a family member limits your options in that chapter where he or she is concerned. But it\'s easy to avoid being seen given your ability to zip from light source to light source, a speedy and fun way to navigate the two floors and multiple rooms of the house. If you choose story, the gameplay is exactly the same, only without any need to worry about spooking the Kaplans; you can wander the house openly. The Novelist isn\'t a game about moment-to-moment gameplay but rather about the impact of decisions over time, so the choice of whether to play in stealth or story mode is ultimately the least meaningful decision you have to make in the game.', 'In The Novelist as in life, disappointment is inevitable.', ""The much more interesting decisions start confronting you immediately. In each chapter, you explore the house looking for clues to the current desires of each family member. These can be letters Linda has written to her sister, sketches Tommy has drawn, notes Dan has scrawled about the book, and the like. At one point, Dan is feeling pressure from his publisher to get some chapters submitted on his new book, while Linda really wants to get some quality time with Dan, and Tommy wants his daddy to play with him for a while. In another chapter, Linda's grandmother's funeral is happening at the same time as an opportunity for a public reading that could save Dan's career, and there's an air show that Tommy, feeling lonely at the isolated house, would love to attend."", 'Before you can make a choice about what the family should do, you need to both investigate the house for clues, and investigate the memories of the characters. When you approach them from behind, you can zip into their minds and see frozen tableaux in the house of moments that have happened recently. By clicking on the figures, you hear exchanges between them, such as Dan asking Linda, who is gazing longingly out a window, ""Is there something out there?"" and her responding, ""The entire world\'s out there."" But these remembered interactions and solitary moments rarely provide much real insight into the characters; the process of entering memories and witnessing them feels more like a hollow, predictable routine that pads out the game than like actual investigation into the hearts and minds of the characters. However, the written words of Linda and Dan change to reflect decisions you made in the previous chapter, and these are more effective at bringing the characters to life.', ""After you've completed the investigation routine in each chapter, it's time to make your decision. You can totally fulfill one character's desires and have another character find an unsatisfying compromise for his or her wants, while the third character's desires will go completely unfulfilled in that chapter. I almost always felt conflicted about my decisions, my heart aching for the character whose desires I'd decided to ignore for the moment. And the situations the characters faced made me think about situations in my own life, about how life is a balancing act, how sometimes we need to make sacrifices for the people we care about, or soldier on with work in the midst of personal crises, how not all of our needs can be met all the time. In The Novelist as in life, disappointment is inevitable."", ""The Novelist isn't immersive; the behaviors of its characters as they wander about the house aren't convincing. You never see them interact with each other in meaningful ways (aside from the frozen moments you see in characters' memories) and you might sometimes see a character walk right through a closed door. The narrative structure also fumbles in its attempts to create an engaging and believable arc. For instance, one chapter might end with Linda tossing a shoe angrily at Dan because of the decisions you made in that chapter, suggesting their relationship is in real trouble. But then the month-end recap that immediately follows and shows how the Kaplans are doing as a result of choices from the past several chapters might have the pair spending a very happy night together at a bed-and-breakfast."", ""And it's frustrating that a game about the struggle to find balance in a family is subtly skewed to put more focus on Dan. You always whisper your choice about what the family should do to Dan and Dan alone, as if he, as family patriarch, is single-handedly responsible for the directions the family takes. It's equally disappointing that, while there's a lot of focus on Linda's career throughout the game, in the final summary of how the decisions the Kaplans made that summer affected their future, the game comments on Dan's career, on Dan and Linda's marriage, and on Tommy's future, but not Linda's professional future."", ""But as a game of ideas, The Novelist works. It's not a challenging game, but the choices you have to make are. I played through the game twice, and was surprised to see how differently things were for the Kaplans in the end based on the different decisions I'd made. When a family member was left struggling or failing in the end because of the choices I'd made, I felt a kind of guilt that moral choices in games rarely make me feel. The Novelist knows that when it comes to the people we love, there are no small decisions.""]"Mark Walton,9-Dec-13,Peggle 2 Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/peggle-2-review/1900-6415588/,8,Xbox One,"['I love the rising notes that accompany the bounce of a Peggle ball as it tumbles from peg to peg, each tinkle perfectly pitched to the serene melodies underneath. I love how each selection on the menu screen is accompanied by the notes from Peer Gynt\'s ""Morning"", a subtle nod to Peggle 2\'s wonderful predecessor. And I love the rainbows, and the sparkles, and the blast of Ode to Joy that accompanies a perfectly cleared Peggle board. It\'s absolutely mesmerizing, and indicative of a game that\'s as much about lifting the weight of the world from your shoulders as it is spending hours figuring out the perfect peg-pummeling shot for a high score--and trust me, once Peggle gets its hooks into you, the hours will fly by.', 'Describe the absolute basics of Peggle to someone though, and they\'ll give you the sort of sympathetic stare they\'d give to someone who\'d suddenly confessed to Coldplay being their favourite ""rock band"". It\'s so stiflingly simplistic at first glance that it\'s hard not to wonder what all the fuss is about. All you do is shoot a small ball at different coloured pegs scattered around a level, attempting to hit each and light them up along the way. Blue pegs give you 100 points, orange pegs need to be cleared to progress, while purple pegs give you score boosts, and green ones activate power-ups. Once the ball drops out of play, the lit pegs disappear, and you fire off another shot. Your only method of control is over the direction of the ball and when you decide to launch it, with a neat physics system taking care of the rest.', ""That might make it seem like there's not a whole lot you can actually do about hitting those pegs with any skill, and for sure, there's an element of luck about the whole thing. But it's that very randomness, the way that each shot is a gamble no matter how well-practiced you are, that makes Peggle so utterly engrossing--and the natural feel of the ball physics means that you never feel hard done by because of its random nature. The ball behaves just how you'd expect, and you adapt how you play around it. For every shot that hits just a single blue peg, there's another that somehow bounces across the board for a long shot bonus, hits a purple peg on the rebound, and then skims its way across a group of orange pegs before neatly landing in the moving free ball bucket at the bottom of the screen. It's an amazing feeling when it happens."", ""There are certainly some tricks to learn that come with practice too. Knowing how to skim a ball across a row of flat pegs for maximum points, or knowing just the right angle to hit a single peg to bounce it directly into the free ball bucket for a trick shot prove invaluable in later levels. With just 10 balls at your disposal, and many more pegs than that to clear, Peggle is just as strategic as it is random. Trying to beat challenges like clearing all the pegs, performing a certain trick shot, or beating an ace high score on each level can keep you going for weeks and months; I'm still trying to 100 percent the seriously tricky Zen level on the original Peggle to this day."", ""There are a bunch of new challenges too, under the guise of trials that challenge you to do things like beat a level under a certain score (much harder than it sounds), perform impossibly long slide shots, and score over a million points on a single level. But Peggle 2 never forces the really difficult trials upon you. There's as much satisfaction to be had from just nailing all the orange pegs on the one of the ingeniously crafted levels as there is in going after all the rainbow trophies that you're awarded for completing challenges. The delicate tones that emanate from each hit peg, the drum rolls, the way the camera zooms in as you're about to hit the last orange peg, and the rapturous explosion of music and colour are all brilliantly designed to stimulate the senses, and give you a real feeling of accomplishment, even for the smallest of tasks."", ""Then there are the Peggle masters, each of them offering a different power up to help you along the way. There's a greater visual focus on them this time, with each character getting the full body treatment, rather than being relegated to a headshot at the top of the screen. The results are absolutely hilarious. Play a Bjorn level and the colourful unicorn pulls the silliest of cringing faces as soon as you're down to your last three balls; perform a particularly great shot and his horn transforms into a rock 'n' roll set of devil horns; and sometimes, for seemingly no reason at all, he farts sparkles."", ""Bjorn is the only returning master this time, bringing his super guide power with him. The rest are all new and feature a bunch of inventive powers that do just enough to change the way a level plays out without undermining the core mechanics. Play a level featuring Berg the yeti and he freezes the screen, making the pegs slide around the screen when you hit them. Clever level design means there's plenty of opportunity to rack up some really high scores by chaining a bunch of pegs together. And if you get a particularly high score, you're treated to the awe-struck bleats of Berg's goat friends and a dance from the yeti himself, complete with a pixelated picture of his rear end."", ""In the first Peggle, Splork and his explosion power tended to be the go-to choice for nailing the really high scores. His counterpart here is Gnorman, a little tin robot that gives you the ability to hit three pegs at once for some outrageous high scores. His power proves particularly useful on levels that feature new armored pegs, which need to be hit twice, and levels that feature bumpers, which let you bounce the ball back into active pegs for more points. In a small but welcome tweak, you don't have to complete the entire game before being able go back and use a different master to tackle the level. Now, you unlock a master simply by making it to their level, which means you can take on the most tricky challenges much sooner this time around."", ""There are other little tweaks too, such as the colourful and imaginative backdrops, which are far more detailed than before, and the background music which gives a more sedate take on the different celebration themes of each character. Yes, this time you're treated to more than just Ode To Joy, and while it'd be a shame to give all the new tunes away here, rest assured they're just as well chosen, and just as shamelessly jubilant."", ""Indeed, it's that shameless pursuit of making Peggle 2 as fun and as accessible as humanly possible--no matter how cheesy the cost--that I absolutely adore. It's the very epitome of a pure gaming experience, one that can be as deep or as simple as you want it to be, and one that never loses sight of what makes it so appealing to so many people. Sure, the window dressing here plays its part in the fun as much as the core mechanics of the game do, but that's no bad thing; that all important feeling of accomplishment comes from the slick visual payoffs and charming audio cues as much as is does from skilful shots. Peggle 2's randomness simply isn't an issue once you're locked into the Peggle groove. It's heaps of fun, totally absorbing, and such a wonderful place to be.""]"Carolyn Petit,6-Dec-13,Adventure Time: Explore the Dungeon Because I DON'T KNOW! Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/adventure-time-explore-the-dungeon-because-i-don-t/1900-6415587/,2,Wii U,"[""Adventure. The word suggests danger, daring, and excitement, perhaps a journey into the perilous unknown. In Adventure Time: Explore the Dungeon Because I DON'T KNOW, you do indeed venture into dangerous realms, but all you find there is unadulterated drudgery. The game possesses none of the whimsy and imagination of the cartoon that inspired it. This is dungeon-crawling at its dullest and most rudimentary."", ""Princess Bubblegum has summoned the heroes of the realm, charging them with exploring the Secret Royal Dungeon beneath her castle and dealing with the rambunctious monsters who are not so securely imprisoned there. Unfortunately, she doesn't warn Finn, Jake, and the rest of the gang that it's more likely that the boredom will kill them than the monsters. You trudge through floors of the dungeon, hacking away at enemies and picking up piles of treasure here and there. That's pretty much it."", ""Of course, there are some great games that rely on this basic premise. Some offer you a diverse range of attacks that feel powerful and are satisfying to use. Some pit you against memorable foes who use attacks that require you to play smartly if you hope to emerge victorious. Some include deep character customization options. Some have terrific gear you can find and equip to make your hero increasingly more powerful. Adventure Time has none of this. The game takes a few cues from the landmark multiplayer arcade dungeon crawler Gauntlet, but despite having the benefit of nearly 30 years' worth of genre advances and innovations to draw upon, Adventure Time fails to even be as exciting a game as that old quarter-muncher."", ""Yes, there are a number of playable characters with different abilities. Marceline can float right over pits and traps, for instance, while the Ice King can freeze enemies. But no matter which character you choose, the exploration remains slow and tedious; the dungeons remain bereft of interesting places, enemies to fight, or items to discover; and the combat remains excruciatingly shallow and simplistic. No subweapon you might find and pick up in the dungeon, be it a kitten gun or a fire hose (that is, a hose that shoots fire) does anything to liven up the process of pushing buttons mindlessly until monsters fall before you. You can play with up to three friends, but then you're all just sharing a miserable experience."", ""After suffering your way through a number of levels, you're given the opportunity to return to the surface with the treasure you've collected, but there's little of interest to spend that treasure on. You can sink it into a few absurdly expensive upgrades to attributes like health and damage, each of which can be upgraded only two or three times. The problem with them being so costly is that you can't stash your gold anywhere. When you reenter the dungeon, you must give up any unspent treasure. This is an idea that works well in games like Rogue Legacy, in which there's a satisfying loop of earning more treasure in the dungeon, which lets you strengthen your character, which lets you earn yet more treasure on your subsequent dungeon runs. But in Adventure Time, spending time slogging through several levels of the dungeon, only to realize that you don't have enough treasure yet to purchase any upgrades and must try to slog through several more levels and collect still more treasure, just feels like punishment on top of punishment."", 'There\'s the rare moment of humor, like when the vampire Marceline remarks, right after you upgrade her health, ""I can\'t die anyway!"" But cutscenes and dialogue exchanges are few and far between, so even the most devout fans of Adventure Time won\'t find enough entertaining quips or goofy moments to reward them for struggling through the dungeon. The game\'s title may not provide justification for exploring the dungeon, but the much bigger I DON\'T KNOW here is why anyone would play this game.']"Tyler Hicks,6-Dec-13,Dead Sky Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dead-sky-review/1900-6415586/,2,PC,"[""You're down to your last clip of ammo. The plan was to make it to the train station just ahead and hold out until help came. But your comrades have already fallen. Poor Billy. Poor Sarah. The despair of the zombie apocalypse had been the catalyst they needed to confess their feelings for one another. If you can hit that next shambler in the head, you may just be able to make the sprint to safety, for now."", 'Sadly, Dead Sky cannot properly capture the inherent dread of such a scenario. When you think of survival shooters, and zombie games in general, you expect a little suspense and tension, and actual fear of death. Unfortunately, Dead Sky is just masquerading as a survival shooter. Instead, it is a fledgling tower defense game that never grows out of its daydreams of being anything more.', ""The game's menu greets you with ill-suited blaring rock music that doesn't fit the tone of the game that follows. (When you're trying to survive the zombie apocalypse, your first step is probably not to turn on a soaring guitar solo to draw attention to yourself and your roving gang of gunmen.) The single-player campaign is a quick six-mission distraction to introduce you to the core multiplayer action, with only two missions actually reflecting that core experience. The game opens up with you defending your buddy's escape plan (his car) from a meager offering of slow-moving, mostly nonthreatening undead."", ""Once the car starts, you must drive away on a long street littered with zombies just waiting for you to plow them over. The mission is failable, but only if you come to a complete stop. And though the road is winding, you can drive straight until the very end for one final turn in order to beat the stage. Once you come to the end of the street, the game introduces you to a caricature hillbilly who tinkers in scrap metal (the game's resource) in order to turn it into more usable forms, like a gun turret or a strange bug zapper that stuns the encroaching zombie horde. Wyatt, the aforementioned redneck, isn't a humorous portrayal at all; he's simply an overacted representation of Southern stereotypes. This character is grating, and he's present throughout the multiplayer game."", ""The campaign attempts to get to survival shooter roots with a trip through the zombie-infested sewers, but because the zombies are uniformly spaced apart, there's almost no tension in the journey. The sewers play more like an attempt at capturing the gameplay of an action role-playing game like Diablo or Torchlight (minus any exciting character skills) than a shooter, and the randomized weapon drops further push the game in that direction. You don't find weapons in preset locations; they drop randomly from the zombies. Their temporary boost in power is great, except that the amazing power of the rocket launcher and railgun is wasted in a sewer with no more than two to three zombies approaching you at a time. There's no epic carnage or cathartic mega-corpse explosion extravaganza."", 'Once you\'ve completed the introductory campaign, the game pats you on the back and instructs you to try out multiplayer. ""OK, let\'s go!"" you think to yourself, as you click Join Game. But, alas, you see naught but ""Finding lobbies..."" on your screen. ""No problem, I\'ll check again in a minute."" You keep telling yourself someone will host a game soon. And finally, a game appears. You click to join. But a fate far scarier than the game\'s tepid zombies slaps you in the face: ""Failed to connect.""', 'The random monster selection can make your otherwise fine defense arrangement useless, because you cannot prepare ahead of time.', 'Should you be lucky enough to find a game, you either must defend a building, or simply stay alive. You start with a bit of scrap metal you can use to upgrade your trusty pistol or purchase a few stationary defenses, which come in handy when you end up settling for a solo attempt on one of the maps intended for multiple players.', ""The multiplayer maps don't have a final objective, but instead require you to survive or to defend the objective for as many waves as you can. Zombies randomly drop machine guns or shotguns for you to wield, but since you have limited ammo and no ability to stockpile weapons for later, they don't change combat for long. Once you pick up a new weapon, you can't switch back to your pistol or to a separate weapon, which greatly drags down the shooter aspects of the game."", ""The shallow shooting might have been more serviceable if the tower defense elements had been fleshed out, but unfortunately, you have only three tower options: a gun turret, a flame turret, and the bug zapper. Other static defenses include a very fragile wall, a bear trap to snare a single zombie, and a mine to clear out a few zombies at once, but to purchase any of these ineffective tools is to throw your scrap metal away. You also have the option to upgrade your character with better offense, defense, or support capabilities, but these upgrade costs quickly outscale the amount of scrap metal you're getting once you consider the upkeep and replacements necessary for your turrets."", 'The ""stronger"" monsters that assault you starting in the second round are randomly generated. In some games you may encounter just a few zombie dogs and zombies with burning attacks, but other attempts at the game may unleash a legion of explosive gas zombies or zombies that pull you out of your comfort zone and into a group to maul you. The random monster selection can make your otherwise fine defense arrangement useless, because you cannot prepare ahead of time.', ""Dead Sky's only saving grace is its inclusion of a leaderboard that lets you see how your attempts fare when stacked against the others defending Wyatt's backwoods cabin or the abandoned wastelands village. Otherwise, everything that Dead Sky does or tries to do, other games do far better. There's little room to experiment from game to game, and there's only so long that fighting to have your name ranked among the few hundred other zombie slayers can keep you grinding in this poor excuse for a tower defense game.""]"Nathan Meunier,3-Dec-13,World of Warplanes Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/world-of-warplanes-review/1900-6415585/,7,PC,"[""With a fuselage chewed up by bullet holes, an injured pilot who's bleeding out, and smoke trailing out of your engine, few things are more gratifying than ramming your doomed fighter headlong into the jerk who put you in such dire straights to begin with. World of Warplanes makes as much room for tactical sneakery as it does fancy flying, which gives your likelihood of surviving an exciting air of uncertainty. When the skies are swarming with fighters, dogfights spill into one another as you rocket through waves of antiaircraft fire and near misses. Layer on top of this an exhaustive list of unlockable planes and part upgrades to tinker with, and you have a game that is far more enjoyable than its repetitive nature might suggest."", ""World of Warplanes is a streamlined arcade-style experience built for easy accessibility. It takes only a minute or two to come to grips with the simple controls, and after a quick piloting tutorial, you're booted right to the battlefield with minimal handholding. It's a whirlwind introduction to be sure, but the flow of battle quickly becomes a familiar groove once you get a few missions under your belt. The fact that there's only one competitive player-versus-player mode to dive into helps you get acclimated quickly, though that limitation is ultimately to the game's detriment."", ""Matches pit opposing squadrons in 15-on-15 battles for air supremacy over massive square maps. Victory is achieved by dealing enough damage to your opponents' base or by blowing every enemy bird out of the sky. The latter tends to be the deciding factor in nearly every battle simply because aggressive players are always on the hunt for the next potential kill. This doesn't make bombing and air-to-ground strafing runs any less useful, since you still gain experience for them, but it does keep matches short. Most games rarely bump up against the 15-minute time limit because there's no one else left in the air at that point."", ""Given the flight speed of the zippier fighter craft, it isn't long before squads clash in explosions of gunfire and chaos. Whether they unfold high in the clouds or closer to the ground, the inevitable dogfights that erupt are a thrilling highlight. Jockeying for position as you dive and climb or circle around to flank a foe--contending with antiaircraft flak and dangerous mountain terrain all the while--makes for some exhilarating moments. Taking damage to key areas of your plane and getting your pilot injured can severely impact handling too. That usually draws enemy fighters to you like hungry buzzards eager for scraps, but it's pretty awesome to land those last few kills when you're limping along."", ""World of Warplanes' maps are packed with beautiful scenery both at ground level and in the skies."", ""Speaking of explosions, your time on the battlefield is often short-lived, at least until you sharpen your piloting skills and unlock better gear for your planes. The experience and cash rewards for making it through a match intact give you a big boost, although death is only a minor bummer thanks to the way missions are handled. Get blown up, and you can still stick around as a spectator to see how things play out, though hopping instantly back to your hangar lets you grab a different ride and start a new game. At first, it's a nuisance that planes are tied to each match you initiate, forcing you to wait until a match is completed before you can free up the plane again. But the upside is that this encourages you to try lots of different craft and gradually improve your whole fleet rather than rely too heavily on one favorite."", ""The depth that World of Warplanes lacks in its sparsity of modes and short-lived air battles pops up in the huge number of craft you can unlock. With hundreds of planes arranged in class tiers across five different countries--USA, USSR, Germany, Japan, and the UK--there's a lot of sweet military hardware to dig through. You'll find everything from old biplanes and burly bombers to more modern jets, and each craft looks outstanding. Gaining access to them is a slow but satisfying process that makes each match you play, no matter how short or long, feel like it's contributing to your overall progress."", ""Your first few aircraft are flimsy and get torn apart quickly in direct fire. Spending accumulated experience earned with each craft lets you access new planes and upgraded parts for each one, ranging from engines and guns to armor and special bullets. That's when they become a lot more formidable and fun to fly. It's a two-stage process, however. Once you spend experience to gain access to each additional ride and extra parts, you have to shell out accumulated in-game cash to actually buy and equip them. It's a grindy system, albeit one that lets you get a lot of cool stuff without having to pay actual cash. "", ""Spending real money on gold currency is needed if you want to expand your hangar to hold a larger number of planes at once, or to speed the whole process up, but you have a good amount of starting space to work with. A small handful of souped-up planes can only be obtained with gold. Aside from being a bit more powerful than their non-premium counterparts within the same class, these craft are not necessarily the absolute best you can fly, but they don't require research and they give you a boost in earned credits and experience. Elsewhere in the shop, you can purchase gold, credits, and temporary packages that boost your experience gain. These purchases range from reasonable to extreme in price, but they give you a solid advantage by providing quicker access to upper-tier crafts and powerful ammo."", ""World of Warplanes' maps are packed with beautiful scenery both at ground level and in the skies. Diving close for bombing runs gives you a closer look at ships, buildings, and infrastructure, while the sun and cloud lighting effects are beautifully captivating. Flying high gives you a strategic advantage to divebomb planes below you, and cloud cover can obscure the view, allowing you to spring a sneaky surprise. The map topography and ground-level designs make a much bigger impact on combat when you drop down to hug mountain peaks, buzz past AA guns, and rocket through deep canyons to try to shake someone on your tail. Despite the game's good looks, it stinks that the map rotation is so limited. Each setting is impressively rednered, but you can't pick which map you play on in a given match. This leads to lots of matches where you fly over the same few vistas, adding to the repetitiousness of the experience."", ""Taking to the skies in a seemingly endless string of short and intense matches proves to be a lot of fun in World of Warplanes, even when you feel caught in a time loop playing the same maps ad nauseam. Every encounter is pleasantly unpredictable, and the crazy kills and near misses keep the steady grind for cash and experience interesting. Ultimately, it's the variety of planes and unlockable goodies available for each aircraft that keep you pushing through the more limited, recycled stretches of this airborne assault freebie. There's room to grow here, but World of Warplanes leaves the runway with a sound foundation intact.""]"Nathan Meunier,3-Dec-13,Blacklight: Retribution Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/blacklight-retribution-review/1900-6415584/,5,PS4,"[""Beneath the neon-bathed futuristic sheen and jagged dubstep warble of Blacklight: Retribution's cyberpunk vibe lies a shooter that plays it too safe for its own good. Minor excitements such as a mech-like robo suit, a flamethrower, and hacking minigames don't tip the scale far enough into innovative territory to round out the standard trigger-happy action on tap here. Every so often, the fast-paced running and gunning hits a high point, when the sprawling industrial maps are filled with warm bodies to blast. This free-to-play online shooter initially proves to be an enticing option on the PlayStation 4 if you're looking for multiplayer mayhem on the cheap, but getting permanent access to Retribution's coolest high-tech killing gadgets can take a punishing toll on your wallet."", ""When it comes to delivering basic bullet-flinging fun, Retribution gets the job done decently. Matches move along at a speedy pace, with only a few seconds passing between kills and respawns. The Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch modes are rounded out by familiar Capture the Flag, Kill Confirmed, and Domination offerings. Perhaps the most unique of the bunch, the latter puts a fun techie spin on point capturing by having you hack nodes with a timed numbers matching game--a frantic and amusing exercise in concentrating under pressure when there's a firefight erupting all around you. When everything clicks in a given match, the momentum of battle can be intensely absorbing, even if there's not a lot of wow factor."", ' ', ""With a few unpleasant quirks, some missing features, and a borderline draconian pricing model, it's hardly a must-have shooter for kicking off the new wave of current-gen gaming."", ""The gritty urban battlefields you shoot it out across have lots of sneaky nooks and crannies to use to your advantage, and the grim atmospheric scenery is beautifully detailed in spots. That said, Blacklight: Retribution is not a shining showcase for the capabilities of Sony's hardware. Texture pop-in on characters and weaponry is noticeable, though it doesn't pose a major problem when you're barreling down hallways and spraying lead in all directions. Death animations, in particular, are janky and inconsistent at best. You tend to either wind up hovering in the air with limbs splayed all akimbo or not reacting at all to the fact that you've just been shot in the face. Other rough spots, such as glitchy walls you can walk through and the omission of the co-op Onslaught mode found in the PC version, make Retribution on the PS4 a clear work in progress."", ""Diving into the action is usually quick and painless, except when it isn't. Playing Retribution on the PS4 means occasionally suffering through agonizing waits to find a game in progress. At times, the player base is anemic. I've regularly been stuck fiddling around for several minutes at a clip waiting for a quick match search to drop me into an active game, only to have to back out and try again. That's aggravating when you just want to get to the good stuff. Once you're in, however, you can stick with the group you're playing with for faster access to repeated matches. But even then, there is no guarantee you'll be fighting against more than a small handful of opponents. Retribution's straightforward combat is at its best when you've got a map full of players locked and loaded to face off against. It's a shame that's such a rarity at the moment."", ""The coolest combat elements arise from Retribution's futuristic trappings. Most notable is a sweet visor that lets you scan through walls to spot enemies. It takes a few moment to disengage, however, and that delayed timing gets you killed if you suddenly find yourself face-to-face with an opponent while using the visor. Points you earn in battle can be spent on the sluggish but brutal hard suit--a mech-like contraption you can hop into that's heavily armed and a thrill to thunder across maps with. It's not an instant win button, though. This beast is weak against flamethrowers and rocket launchers, which are among the other fun CP purchases at your disposal. This in-match spending system is separate from the accumulated virtual currency and the real-world cash you're required to spend to access tons of gun parts, killer bots, cool traps, and other goodies needed to get the most out of this experience."", ""A ridiculously broad array of guns, getups, and doodads to swap out across your arsenal drive the ever-constant push toward leveling up and amassing spendable points. Customization is the key here, but it's also the downfall of Retribution's deceptive free-to-play model. Many of the guns and items available can be temporarily rented using currency you earn from completing matches. This is a great way to get a feel for different kits before shelling out actual money, but it takes an absurd amount of grinding to get enough to rent a single gun for one day, much less a week. Considering there are dozens of attachments available, ranging from scopes and muzzles to stocks and decorations, you have to churn through a ridiculous number of matches just to get a little taste of the goods. Real cash can be used to rent items too, but you'll want to save your money for the real kicker: permanent unlocks."", ""Permanent unlocks require real money, and they aren't cheap. A single gun can run you around $3.50, and between armor and tactical upgrades, you can drop upward of $30 on customizing a single character and loadout. By the way, that single character and loadout are all you start with. Additional quick-swap loadout slots cost $5 apiece. I can appreciate how the rental system lets you try before you buy, but prices across the board are unnecessarily steep. Retribution is only free-to-play if you're content with a harshly limited, temporary arsenal."", ""Temper your expectations, however, and you can squeeze a reasonable amount of entertainment from Retribution without paying a cent. While they're not as spectacular as the more high-end kits at your disposal once you level up and shell out some real-world green, the standard assault rifle, frag grenades, and other essential gear you start off with do a fine job of taking down adversaries. I spent many hours blasting away with only the limited freebie arsenal at my disposal and had quite a bit of fun along the way."", ""Strapped for cash and looking for something punchy to play on your PS4? Blacklight: Retribution has its fun moments to balance out the frustrating ones. But with a few unpleasant quirks, some missing features, and a borderline draconian pricing model, it's hardly a must-have shooter for kicking off the new wave of current-gen gaming.""]"Mark Walton,2-Dec-13,Fighter Within Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/fighter-within-review/1900-6415583/,2,Xbox One,"[""It's impossible to look cool playing Fighter Within. I'm not talking about a high standard of cool either, like the Fonz banging on a jukebox. No, while playing Fighters Within, you will look less cool than some pantless schlub who barely resembles a functional member of society. Frankly, any activity that involves flailing your arms and legs around like an apathetic Steven Seagal impersonator is going to draw some prolonged stares and titters (or in my case, howling laughter from supposedly supportive colleagues). This isn't a problem in of itself; after all, you can look just as foolish playing the likes of Just Dance. The problem is that the flailing is in service to an awful fighting game that lends no joy to your embarrassment."", ""Unlike in Fighter Within's predecessor, Fighters Uncaged, the motion tracking is not entirely hopeless this time around, even if its menu system is. I take a weedy swing at the screen, and my character punches; I do a little hop, and my character kicks; I hug thin air, and my character goes in for a throw. No, the greatest problem with Fighter Within isn't its ability to sense your simplistic moves, but the incomprehensible banality of the game itself. A great fighting game is about speed, depth, and maybe some outlandish moves and combos. But in Fighter Within, none of that exists, because of its physical dependence on the bags of meat attempting to play it."", ""Character movement is limited to sluggish hops backwards and forwards as you awkwardly lean your body; there's only one type of kick; and combos are automated after you land five successive punches. Every drop of fun has been viciously squeezed out of the game, and the action is slowed down to a lifeless crawl. Some attempt has been made to add depth to the combat with counters and dodges and special moves charged by holding your arms up in the air. But these all fall prey to a lack of precision and a delayed response time, and the game soon devolves into a mess of flapping limbs."", ""A Fighter Within match goes down as follows: pick from a list of dull or--in the case of the overweight, angry kilt-wearing Scottish guy--offensive stereotypes; choose one of the bland, barely there arenas; stand like a lemon in front of the TV for what seems like an eternity as you feel your life ebb away during the excruciatingly long loading times; punch at thin air as fast as humanly possible until you trigger a combo; watch the lifeless combo animation; repeat these steps until your opponent is defeated; quickly realise that you'll never get those 10 minutes of your life back; and question life choices."", ""You can rope some poor soul in for some local multiplayer this time around, which may let you stretch those 10 minutes out to 20. Any more than that, though, and you're pushing the boundaries of friendship, patience, and sanity more than most people are willing to. A fun party game Fighter Within is not."", 'If you\'re playing solo, then it\'s worth noting that you have to subject yourself to one of the most laughable storylines to have ever graced a video game. It\'s not just bad; it\'s really, really bad, and the sort of thing you\'d hear in a poorly dubbed kung fu movie, only without any of the kitsch charm. It meanders from coming-of-age adventure to fantasy gibberish with little explanation, but it\'s the dialogue--delivered with all the enthusiasm of a wet sock--that really takes it to the next level of awful. In one exchange, a character exclaims ""I\'ve gotta run, someone\'s waiting for me."" The reply? ""Yeah, my knuckles!"" Lines make so little sense that they swing right back from being bad to being so bad they\'re hilarious. Case in point: ""The only freedom is the fight to conquer for freedom."" I don\'t know how to begin trying to explain that one.', ""Yes, the motion tracking isn't as bad as in Fighters Uncaged, and yes, at least there's two-player combat this time. But that's pretty much like applying lipstick to an ugly pig. This is a totally flawed game that offers little more than a slow, barely competent combat system and a laughable storyline. And hey, if you're that desperate to experience Fighter Within, get a friend to repeatedly kick you in the shins. It's free, a nearly spot-on representation of the game, and far less painful.""]"Tom Mc Shea,27-Nov-13,Super Motherload Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/super-motherload-review/1900-6415582/,7,PS4,"[""Beneath the surface of Mars lies tranquility. The exotic planet houses valuable minerals amid the impenetrable rocks, and as you survey the vast subterranean world, a serenity washes over you. It's not the treasures that drive you many leagues below the surface, nor is it the promise of unraveling a mysterious conspiracy. No, it's the desire for solitude that serves as your motivation. A calm that can only exist when the tight spaces surrounding you provide comfort, rather than claustrophobia, and every clump of dirt you push aside puts you one meter further from civilization. There's pleasure in Super Motherload's excavation duties, and it's that escape that pulls you ever deeper into this alien world."", ""Of course, you weren't set to Mars to unwind from the everyday toils of life on Earth. The unquenchable greed of a starving corporation shuttled you to this distant oasis. The Solarus Corporation craves money, its very existence dependent upon expanding its already bursting coffers. And so you dig for gold and silver, trigger explosions, and circumvent magma, all to keep the powers that be happy. It's a thankless job, so you find respite where you can, but their presence is a constant reminder. The dreamy contentment of rhythmic mining is shattered when voices scream in your ear, extolling you to dive ever deeper. As if there was any other direction to travel. Hints of psychotic episodes infecting those already stationed below ground, of alien civilizations threatened by your largesse, offer more distraction than intrigue, and never blossom into fulfilling tales."", ""So you tune out the noise. Your capable driller eliminates debris as quickly as it can soar up vertical passageways. Carve tunnels beneath the two-dimensional landscape, shifting away dirt in strategic paths to ensure that whatever mineral you desire becomes yours. Smart planning leads to copious rewards. As mobile as your driller is, it's unable to burrow while hovering, so if you're not careful, troves of platinum and emeralds might rest within sight but out of reach, repeatedly lecturing you for being so sloppy. A feeling of accomplishment washes over you as you scoop up the many minerals that populate this world. There's little guidance in how best to proceed, so when you figure out how to make the many gems and minerals yours, you feel as if you earned whatever spills into your purse."", ""There's pleasure in Super Motherload's excavation duties, and it's that escape that pulls you ever deeper into this alien world."", ""Your driller is agile, yes, but also fragile. Without enemies to fear, it's your own carelessness that provides the biggest danger. Even with this knowledge, it's easy to forget about your own vulnerability. The lone propeller atop your craft provides surprising lift, and as you careen joyfully toward the surface, smashing into an ill-placed rock can lead to a quick grave. However, punishment won't leave much of a mark. Your cargo is unceremoniously taken away, but you're allowed to carry on undeterred. It's your driller's other failings that provide the most distress. Fuel is as valuable as anything on Mars, and your cargo hold is quite small. As you quickly eat away at your gasoline and extra space, your driller soon becomes useless. So you must resurface to the nearest station, where you unload your goods and refill. This is a frequent and unsatisfying necessity of life underground. And though you can purchase expensive teleporters, you spend too much time drifting between your base and the excavation site."", ""At least you can make use of all of the money you're accumulating. Upgrade your driller when you return back to base to extend its life ever so slightly. Expand the cargo hold and fuel tank, strengthen your hull, and improve the speed of your craft. Sink money into a radar to be able to identify which debris is desirable, and what's just dirt. Unfortunately, the radar isn't much help. The more money you spend on it, the more focused it becomes, but it's rarely detailed enough to provide information that you couldn't gleam from just using your eyes. At least the other upgrades offer more tangible rewards. The option to smelt materials provides the most interesting upgrade. Your smelter unlocks combinations that can earn you money much quicker. By nabbing materials in a specific pattern, you automatically forge alloys, which adds a dose of strategy to your shoveling duties."", ""As you dive deeper below the surface, the terrain becomes more difficult to navigate. Rocks and magma halt your progress, so you must find clever ways to avoid them. That's where bombs come in. By either picking up bombs while digging or purchasing them at shops, you gain an invaluable way to borrow deeper. Be careful, though, because a sizable C4 blast could eliminate nearby pockets of gold even though you were trying to disintegrate some rocks. So, just like in real life, you should do a bit of planning before you detonate your explosives. T-shaped blasts are perfect for carving out a niche to dig while vertical strikes can clear an entire column in a snap. Charge certain blocks with an electromagnetic jolt to turn them into magma, and then either use a bomb to clear that lava out of the way, or drill through it yourself while taking some damage. Super Motherload hides its puzzle elements in the early going, but if you want to become the richest person on Mars, you have to become a thoughtful and willing arsonist."", ""There's beauty in loneliness. Super Motherload is at its best when you're miles below Mars' surface, lost in the peaceful rhythm of excavation. But if that solitude frightens you, three of your friends can join you in your quest for minerals. Just don't get your hopes up for online friendships to blossom; Super Motherload is offline only. No matter if you're alone or with friends, there's an uncommon appeal to your extraterrestrial exploits. There's no excitement here, nothing that will make you whoop or yell. The draw comes from the slow satisfaction of carving intricate paths, of razing rocks and planting bombs. It's thoughtful desolation. Super Motherload somehow makes alienation feel like a warm embrace.""]"Cameron Woolsey,27-Nov-13,Luxuria Superbia Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/luxuria-superbia/1900-6415581/,5,PC & iPhone/iPod,"[""Luxuria Superbia is a strange artistic and emotional experiment, coyly blending abstract, vibrant visuals with libidinous imagery and themes. You delve into flower-shaped tunnels, coaxing the pale walls to life by opening flower buds, which burst open with images tied to the stage's theme. But overly simplistic controls and a refusal to evolve forces the game into the realm of tedium, turning this colorful ride into a tiring venture."", 'The game is tongue-in-cheek regarding its sensual nature, but the signals are clear. The uncomplicated soundtrack is highlighted by descant hums and sighs, while phrases such as ""Touch me"" and ""Keep going"" appear in the center of the screen. Progress is demonstrated with a bumpy border enveloping the edge of the screen, and with color slowly climbing a tall pillar with a large, rounded cap, which erupts in varied images upon reaching fulfillment.', ""You open the flower buds utilizing a twin-stick controller, or two fingers when using a touchscreen device. Points are attributed by keeping the pulsating walls rich in color, and this concept does offer a slight challenge. The game insists on a delicate touch; prodding without delicacy ends the round prematurely. The goal is to keep the walls flushed, but sometimes it's necessary to back off and let the pace relax, gradually causing the walls to lose color until stimulated again."", ""The game's resistance to offering anything new beyond its simple concept hinders it from reaching a satisfying release."", ""The longer you traverse the tunnel, the more points you accumulate. An icon on the screen shows how many points you have gained, as well as how close you are to acquiring one of the stage's three medals: bronze, silver, or gold. When you reach the gold medal, the next stage opens up upon revisiting the menu. There are 12 stages in total, each of which has a different motif, from grassy green fields of birds and bees to the dark lavender of space. But it is not the stages or themes that ultimately bog the game down. The main problem Luxuria Superbia faces is that it's not particularly engaging--at least, not for long."", ""In Luxuria Superbia, your only battle is your fight with boredom. From your foray into the first tunnel to the final climax, the pace remains stagnant. The game's mechanics are easy to pick up after a few failed attempts, but there is no evolution beyond the first stage. Where some games would change in parallel to your progress, Luxuria doesn't step beyond its comfort zone. After the first two stages, any sense of amusement quickly tapers off as you begin to realize that, though the number of walls increase, each stage is functionally the same. Luxuria gets tiresome and repetitive, and it takes effort not to nod off while completing some of the lengthy stages later in the game."", ""There is no incentive to complete each stage to full. Earning a gold medal allows you to continue, but unless you're a completionist, filling the pillar offers no reward. The game yields nothing else after completing each pillar to its top, and there is little reason to play through the game again. Your overall experience may improve if you decide to jump into the game with a partner, who can play with a second controller or offer a second finger with a touchscreen device. While this may result in some extra laughs and enjoyment, it doesn't take long to have two people yawning, instead of just one. Luxuria Superbia's unusual premise roused my interest early, but the game's resistance to offering anything new beyond its simple concept hinders it from finding a satisfying rhythm.""]"Nick Capozzoli,26-Nov-13,EVE Online Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/eve-online-review/1900-6415576/,8,PC,"[""Tranquility. I've always puzzled at the name of EVE Online's single server. It's an ironic moniker to lend to a world where hundreds of thousands of players jockey for resources, scheme, spy, and blow each other up. On that one server, wars wage in perpetuity. Scammers ply their trade outside crowded space stations. Fortunes are made and lost amid the bustle of a full-fledged economy. None of it feels particularly tranquil."", ""And yet, Carl Sagan once noted that from space, Earth--for all its chaos--is nothing but a pale blue dot. So it goes with EVE: step far enough back from CCP's sci-fi massively multiplayer online game, and a picture of tranquility begins to emerge. Ten years of steady growth. The recent release of a 20th free expansion, Rubicon. Throughout all, consistency of vision, commitment, and support. It's no small achievement in the winter of the massively multiplayer online role-playing game, when young games are born, live, and die, all in World of Warcraft's shadow. In the face of such competition, EVE's languid pace would seem a detriment, and yet, like the universe, EVE is ever expanding outward."", ""EVE cultivates an appreciation for scales, vectors, and inertia, because it makes their mastery a matter of life and death. The game supports a healthy variety of pursuits, including nonviolent options like building, trading, or mining, but at some point almost all players must hazard a jaunt around EVE's tangled network of interconnected solar systems. Each system is a room of sorts connected by stargates that act as metaphorical doorways. They're spacious chambers, big enough to fit planets, asteroid belts, and space stations with a few trillion miles to spare, but danger always has a way of finding you in EVE. If you're lucky, it'll only come in the form of pirates or warring fleets that open fire on sight. If you're unlucky, it'll be a scammer, spy, or saboteur playing EVE's tacitly sanctioned metagame against you."", 'Conflict runs tangential to even the most pacifistic careers in EVE. After all, it\'s easier to maintain a lively spaceship market if players are always blowing each other up. But when things come to blows, it\'s actually a tidy affair. Ships can be piloted by clicking about in space, but most actions in EVE hinge on more mechanical commands like ""maintain distance"" or ""warp to"". It\'s a math-oriented system that hinges on numbers like distance, radii, and acceleration. Once the enemy has been targeted and the keys for weapons have been pressed, battles ebb and flow according to who can dictate range as their ships circle. Large-scale battles are as chaotic and complex as any sci-fi war scene, and skirmishes are thrillingly staccato. Victory in either is less a product of reflex than of strategy. The prelude to war--proper equipment, communication, teammwork, and patience--is usually the deciding factor. As often as a good fight seems to find the unwilling in EVE, it can prove elusive for those seeking it out. For every minute of battle or plunder, there are hours spent as prey eludes capture, as fleets circle and dance to the reports of their forward scouts.', 'Almost every player is an annalist of some sort, contributing anecdotes on forums, reporting from battle lines, issuing propaganda, or mapping political boundaries.', ""Indeed, EVE's pace is glacial indeed...right until it isn't. A dominant alliance might hold a third of the world in an iron grip for ages, until a spot of corporate espionage dispels it into the digital ether overnight. An interstellar bank could compound every investment it's entrusted with for years, until it suddenly absconds with billions. The universe's first Titan-class ubership may be a world-beater, until it's destroyed because the pilot chooses an inopportune moment to log off. They're the kinds of stories that make headlines outside of gaming circles, the kind that EVE is uniquely equipped to tell. Whether you're speaking to the allure of exploring EVE's vast universe, the machinations of its political scene, or even the prospects of the game's next expansion, that capacity for upheaval is a draw unto itself."", ""What's refreshing about EVE is how much of that change is user-driven. Player characters in the game are canonically immortal, their consciousness tied to clones that are awakened whenever they find themselves on the wrong end of the metaphorical photon torpedo. So-called pod pilots are the movers and shakers of the EVE universe, and enjoy a privileged position as mercenary demigods (consider for a moment the level of desperation that would drive a non-player character to enlist under a commander who, by definition, never goes down with the ship, and you'll begin to grasp the morbidity of EVE's lore). What gets moved or shaken is a matter of taste. It might mean battle, as a soldier or pirate. It might mean cleaning up after said battles, and pawning the salvage. Or it might mean moving goods from one place to another, and shaking whenever outlaws start eyeing your loot. Each endeavor can be pursued in the name of EVE's four hawkish NPC empires, a smattering of lesser powers, or the great host of player corporations."", ""Picking what banner to fly is always an important decision in an MMORPG, but in EVE, the decision can make or break the experience entirely. Should you have no allies, the vast reaches of space can be brutally lonely and unforgiving. Sure, there are hundreds of space stations to rest in, nominal communities strewn about the network of solar systems that dot EVE's pointillistic map. But though the game now allows you to walk the interiors of these structures, there's little humanity to be found inside. NPCs are still just portraits in the interface that proffer textual missions. Other players are just smaller portraits in your chat feed. The resultant sense of disembodiment impinges on every interaction in EVE, and it helps to explain the popularity of extra-game forums and meet-ups. Absent a few friendly faces, it's just not that easy to make regions with names like The Bleak Lands or Stain feel like home. Go figure."", ""Actually, Stain seems like Shangri-la compared to 0FZ-2H. That's the naming convention of zero-security systems, which fall outside the protection of NPC guards, and where EVE's player alliances battle for control of the game's open territories. Zero security also sees CCP's most brilliant and nefarious contribution to player-versus-player gameplay: regions, and the distribution of resources therein, are asymmetrical. Zero-sec space tempts with its more lucrative opportunities, but making the trip means leaving the safety of the empires. Inequalities exist among the lawless regions, too. The imbalance creates further incentives for players to band together, if only for the express purpose of evicting those ahead of them at the table."", ""Asymmetry must be in CCP's mission statement somewhere. It's certainly visible in the designs of EVE's spaceships: intricate, inventive crafts that range in scale from small yacht to small state. Asymmetry colors the use of those ships as weapons, too. At first blush, the more expensive, upper-echelon crafts seem overpowered. That perception holds true, until you develop an appreciation for asymmetrical warfare. There are no restrictions--mechanical or moral--on the size of fleets corporations can bring to the field, and with enough cheap frigates and cruisers, most foes can be felled. Barring that, there's always sabotage, as legitimate a tactic in EVE as any."", ""Big, expensive ships are also big, expensive targets, either for rival corporations or pirates that operate on the fringes of high-security space. Being blown up might not mean as much if you just wake up in a distant clone vat, but it can take a serious toll on your supply of ISK, EVE's currency. Ships that get destroyed are gone for good, along with all the expensive and rare equipment they've been kitted out with. That can include PLEX, an in-game item that represents real playing time in EVE (and a viable alternative to the game's $9.99 a month cost for dedicated players), meaning some losses can hurt a player's real wallet, too. Like most aspects of EVE, death is harsh and unforgiving, but the risks magnify the highs and lows in kind. A venture into the borderlands is a tense, calculated gamble, where every jump to a new system might expose you to predation."", ""Truth be told, it ought to be even riskier. To get a feel for what dangers lie in wait in the system you occupy, you need only glance at your local chat channel. Every present player is listed therein, from the most genteel miner to the scurviest pirate. After a decade of patches and fixes, it's strange that local chat has managed to avoid the axe. It has always felt like a temporary solution that has taken root, an anachronism so entangled in the rest of EVE's systems that it has become difficult to excise. The illusion that you're an interstellar explorer, or that there are unknown dangers around every corner, breaks a bit when every lowlife in the solar system is your Facebook friend."", 'Perhaps that\'s just CCP\'s vision of the future, some kind of acerbic commentary on our subservience to the computer. Considering the rest of EVE\'s interface, though, that\'s unlikely. The game, oft-labeled ""spreadsheets in space,"" is still as impenetrable as ever, a technophile\'s fever dream of 3D overlays, extension lines, charts, and impossibly tiny fonts. It\'s clean and eminently customizable, and it leaves a lot of room for breathtaking views of nebulae and stars, but even 10 years in, I\'m still unsure about some of its more esoteric functions. Yet with some practice, it\'s undeniably useful, even more so now that CCP has made improvements to wayfinding and interaction. ', 'Player characters in the game are canonically immortal, their consciousness tied to clones that are awakened whenever they find themselves on the wrong end of the metaphorical photon torpedo.', 'All that considered, it\'s probably unsurprising that EVE seems to attract a, let\'s say, bookish sort of clientele. Almost every player is an annalist of some sort, contributing anecdotes on forums, reporting from battle lines, issuing propaganda, or mapping political boundaries. It all contributes to one of the most exhaustive and fascinating repositories of lore to be found in gaming, one that\'s created by developer and player alike. Heck, the game\'s most anarchic alliance--the aptly named Goonswarm--is also home to its most ardent archivists, members who log the minutiae of nearly every battle and political play. Even the most disengaged players sign their marks in EVE\'s ledgers, with purchase histories and entries on the ""killed by"" reports automatically generated when they die.', ""I've been on the wrong end of a fair number of those reports over the years. I remember the first time I quit EVE, so many expansions ago, before the arrival of opt-in high-security warfare that helped to fill the gaps between pirate raids and alliance battles. I was bored: in the wrong corporation, in the wrong part of space, and growing frustrated and restless. Unable to rouse a raiding party, I took my best ship and went looking for trouble alone. I found it in the form of two vigilantes. They locked me down and laid siege to my ship, whittling away my defenses while my guns struggled to track their speedier crafts. I pulled out every trick in my bag. I feinted, scrapped, and stalled desperately, but I was doomed."", ""It took a full hour and a half, but my vessel eventually succumbed. As klaxons blared and the hull of my prized ship rocked with the impact of missiles, I scrolled my mousewheel and zoomed out--zoomed out until it was just a pale dot, and tried not to think about all the ISK I'd just lost."", 'I was back within the month.']"Miguel Concepcion,26-Nov-13,Madden NFL 25 Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/madden-25-review/1900-6415580/,7,PS4 & Xbox One,"[""As silver anniversaries go, Madden NFL 25 falls short, aside from the obvious title and the intro video of Madden logos from years past. If anything in Madden NFL 25 exemplifies John Madden's game legacy, it's in EA Sports' attempts at authenticity, even if it's only in select areas of the game. It is very much a product of its times, given the emphasis on option offense, a reflection of the option-intensive 2012 NFL season. For this year's new consoles, Madden 25 isn't a major overhaul, but nor is it just a port with better textures."", ""No matter how often Madden games put run plays at the forefront of the playbook, it still can't escape the appeal of the long bomb. Even on Pro difficulty, finding an open receiver to catch a 30 yard pass is easy. The chances of a pass completion are high enough that you still feel like you're in the game even when you're down by 14 points with 90 seconds left on the clock. The offense is even more empowered in the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions now that pass blocking has been strengthened, giving the quarterback more protection. You may feel sorry for the other team, but watching the pass blockers earn their keep in replays is a beautiful sight. Defense still has a low success rate in catching interceptions; maybe if players didn't so often overextend themselves, the ball wouldn't bounce off their outstretched forearms."", ' ', ""If you believe in the run, Madden 25 has a lot of ground weapons, but there is a learning curve. There's a lot of hard work needed to make the most of this year's new run-based precision modifiers. This feature provides an additional set of running moves to an already suitable selection of maneuvers. Knowing what moves to use and when can be a challenge, especially when split-second decisions have to be made and the resulting button commands are akin to fighting game combos. At least the tutorial is so robust and easy to use that several hours committed to run training can yield big plays as meaningful as any long pass."", ""For better or worse, the home crowd roars to all big outcomes, an overdue step up from every Madden game prior, including the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of Madden 25. Getting a new set of downs and having the crowd react as excitedly as you shows that there are signs of life in the stands. Also included are the long-awaited 3D model crowds, although they aren't as animated as the noise level would have you believe. Fans in the stands are still a result of a copy and paste operation, but at least the duplication is less obvious in the crowds than in the row of similarly dressed press photographers you spot on the sidelines. For each anomaly, like a poor facial render of a head coach, there's a subtle detail, like a wide receiver who tries to keep both feet in the field during a catch."", ""Madden 25 does everything it can to demand my weekly attention. I respect that its incentives aren't mere double XP bonuses. Fantasy football integration is good, but getting a quick-loading roster update based on a given week's real life games is even better. A narrow ticker at the bottom of the screen shows the most recent scores, upcoming kickoffs, and injury reports. It was curious to even see updates about college football star Johnny Manziel, as if EA Sports wants us to keep him in mind before his inevitable pro draft in a year or two. With the Snap functionality and Microsoft's partnership with the NFL, such news feeds on the Xbox One feel redundant. Still, playing Madden 25 while having a live NFL game play on Snap made me feel like a momentary superfan."", ""The commentary scripts delivered by Jim Nantz and Phil Simms are wisely packed with history, effective as subtle filler. As a lifelong Niners fan, my game against the Cowboys was all the more believable when the booth made specific comments about the two teams' famous rivalry in the 90's. Jim and Phil won't comment on this year's improbable winning streak by the Chiefs, but they do get involved in the fictional career mode. References to prior games and commenting on injuries add a lot to the authenticity. These remarks are welcome in a sport where considerable airtime is filled by stating the obvious. Yes, Mr. Simms, teams do feel more confident when they're in the lead."", ""Beyond the action on the field, there's the return of the franchise mode, now called Connected Franchise. It provides adequate role-playing experiences in a pro football context, putting you in the shoes of either a player, coach, or owner. As an owner, it's entertaining to make low level choices on food concessions as well as more fantastical decisions like moving an established team to a new city. It borders on novelty as its appeal wears thin after a season, leaving one to wonder how much better this mode would be if it had more simulation style features. Complementary to Connected Franchise is the return of the collectible-card driven Madden Ultimate Team. With its virtual cards and the blind pack appeal, Ultimate Team is the one aspect of Madden 25 where microtransactions makes the most sense. You might find it a more rewarding mode than Connected Franchise, provided you take the time to understand its complexities, like tailoring a team based on a quarterback's strengths."", ""For each anomaly, like a poor facial render of a head coach, there's a subtle detail, like a wide receiver who tries to keep both feet in the field during a catch."", ""As part of the launch lineups of both of this year's new consoles, Madden NFL 25 is a fine entry that relies on the foundation of the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions with a few meaningful improvements. Pass protection that depicts an offensive line truly working together is a long-awaited improvement that series fans will love, and there are tangible dividends in learning the running game, provided you invest the time. Madden 25 lands on the positive end of the quality spectrum, and it's satisfying enough to warrant weekly sessions well beyond Super Bowl XLVIII."", ' ']"Carolyn Petit,25-Nov-13,Powerstar Golf Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/powerstar-golf-review/1900-6415579/,7,Xbox One,"[""Golf might be the very definition of a game that is simple conceptually, but exceptionally difficult to master. It's this mix of simplicity and challenge that makes golf video games so captivating, when they get it right. Which Powerstar Golf does--mostly. There's nothing revolutionary here, but Powerstar Golf is an absorbing game in the tradition of the Hot Shots Golf series, with some fun competitive features and a loot system that offers you enticing rewards for your progress, but can also be stingy with the goods."", ""When you first fire up Powerstar Golf, you have access to only two golfers and one course, the leisurely City Park. Each golfer has his or her own unique ability that can be used a set number of times in each event. Scientist Reiko Kobayashi's Tesla field, for instance, puts just a teensy bit of magnetic pull on the hole, giving you a slight edge when putting, while retired astronaut Frank Weaver's rocket launch ability lets him send balls flying farther than they would otherwise. These characters and the others you can unlock have a fashion sense and an angular look that make the game feel as if it takes place in some idealized vision of the 1950s."", ""It's at City Park that you learn the basics--how swings are performed by tapping to start, tapping again to set the swing's power, and tapping one last time for accuracy. It's a straightforward approach to swinging, and just tricky enough that nailing the power and accuracy of a shot never stops feeling great. Simple as it is, though, it becomes quite complicated when you realize you have to take factors like wind and terrain into account. It's your struggle against these factors that makes success on the links so satisfying, but Powerstar Golf doesn't go far enough in helping you to understand the tools at your disposal. Brief tutorial videos introduce you to concepts like putting spin on the ball to curve your shot and to the properties of pitch shots and chip shots. But at no point does the game illuminate the difference between a 3 wood and a 5 wood, or explain why you might want to use a 9 iron for certain shots and a 4 iron for others. Since the game doesn't shy away from many of the complexities of real golf in its mechanics, it's a shame that you can't say the same about the tutorials."", ""Though the game doesn't go far enough in its efforts to help you succeed on the golf course, it does make your successes, large and small, feel like a cause for celebration. On every shot you take, you can see markers on the course indicating your previous personal best, as well as the best performances among your friends, and even the world record. The game tracks things like the longest drive, the closest approach within 75 yards, and the closest approach beyond 150 yards. And each time you beat your own personal best for longest putt or anything else, the previous marker for your performance vanishes and is replaced with a new one as the game celebrates your achievement. The game finds little ways to make you feel good, even when you're having a bad day on the course."", ""It's on the green where most of your dreams are realized or shattered, where your heart sinks as a chance at a birdie turns into a double bogey when you miscalculate the left slope in the terrain or overcompensate for an uphill climb. But if the game of golf (and of Powerstar Golf) couldn't conjure such heartbreak, the victories wouldn't be as sweet, and the difficulty of putting properly means that when you do sink that birdie from a distance, you feel like a champ."", ""As you play, you level up, unlocking new courses and new career events, though the process can take a while. You may be eager to see what challenges await in the lush Emperor's Garden course or in the tropical and volcanic Burning Sands course while you're still stuck only having access to City Park and the autumnal Rocky Ridge. Leveling up isn't enough, in and of itself, to get you access to additional golfers. For that, you must defeat each of them in career events on their home course, and these events can be devilishly difficult. Two-thirds of the game's playable characters require you to win tough events before you can access them, and you might tire of playing those nine-hole contests over and over again in a bid to unlock them."", ""You can improve your performance with gear that you purchase using credits you earn during play, but you can't just pick out a more precise putter or a more powerful set of irons. Instead, you buy packs that contain five items, and each item could be gear, or a onetime-use booster (a 20 percent boost to the experience you earn, for instance), or a new equippable perk for your caddie (a 50 percent chance for the ball to skip on the surface of a water hazard, perhaps), or even just a new outfit for a golfer or caddie. The element of chance makes it exciting to fork over your credits and see what you end up with, and the color coding of items in the green-blue-purple-orange tier system familiar from so many loot-driven role-playing games makes getting the rare, high-end stuff especially exciting."", 'At least, until you rack up enough credits that you can buy packs guaranteed to contain nothing but orange-colored ""extreme"" gear. Acquiring that many credits, however, would take an extremely long time, given the slow pace at which the game doles them out. As it is, you can purchase a pack of blue ""pro"" gear after every few events and purple ""elite"" gear after every several, and there\'s always a chance these packs will include a few items from the next tier up. But the game is just stingy enough about doling out credits to nudge you toward purchasing them with real money. This option isn\'t yet active in the game\'s online store, but there\'s already a button prompt for it, so it\'s likely coming very soon.', ""Thankfully, Powerstar Golf makes your time on the links enjoyable, whether or not you have any interest in sinking money into microtransactions to get some extra goodies. This game covers well-trodden territory, but the way that it tracks your performance and the performance of your friends makes it a fine fit for the Xbox One's launch lineup, and a pleasant way to spend some time.

The authentic and adorable behaviors they exhibit make Zoo Tycoon an endearing game that fosters an appreciation for the diversity of creatures with whom we share this planet. Unfortunately, Zoo Tycoon's interface makes the work of building and managing your zoo really feel like work, diminishing the pleasures to be had in creating a great place for people to observe and interact with the animal kingdom."", ""You spend some of your time with Zoo Tycoon in what's called zoo view, controlling a zookeeper who can run about the zoo grounds on foot, or leap into cute buggies that look like tigers or zebras and go careening about on four wheels. The buggies are fun to drive, and come complete with hand brakes you can slam on to make wild turns and leave tire tracks in your wake. And don't worry; you can't hurt anyone, no matter how recklessly you speed about in your elephant buggy. It's also in zoo view that you can interact with animals, holding out fruit or vegetables to be plucked right from your hands by elephants, giraffes, or antelopes; spraying hippos, rhinos, and other animals; or playing monkey see, monkey do with lions, tigers, or chimpanzees (which are not monkeys). The first time a giraffe slowly lowers its long neck to grab that apple from you is magical, and it's fun to just watch meerkats stand about in that adorable vigilant pose of theirs or observe bears as they go down a slide."", ""But the game's other view, called tycoon view, is far more practical for accomplishing the sorts of things you need to spend most of your time doing. In this overhead view, you place new exhibits and edit existing ones, as well as adopt new animals; build concession stands, restrooms, zookeeper centers, and other facilities; and beautify your zoo with all sorts of statues, fountains, topiaries, and other decorations. Placing new exhibits is a breeze, and you never need to put too much thought into designing the layout of your zoo, if you don't want to. Pathways automatically spring up to connect any new exhibits to the existing zoo."", 'There are benefits to spreading things out in a sensible way, though; guests may not be thrilled if all of the food options are on the far end of the zoo, for instance, or if one section\'s collection of animals puts the variety of animals on display in another section to shame. Monitoring this stuff is easy; at any time, you can ""ping"" anything from the social satisfaction of animals to your guests\' satisfaction with entertainment options, and you get a quick, at-a-glance indication of how these wants are being met across the zoo so that you can easily spot problem areas. Zoo Tycoon also notifies you about problems as they spring up--animals falling ill from neglect, guests complaining about the lack of food options, or what have you--so it\'s easy to prevent any trouble from getting too out of hand.', ""But while it makes some actions easy, the interface makes others needlessly time-consuming, and since you need to do the same sorts of things over and over again in Zoo Tycoon, this becomes a serious source of frustration. New exhibits typically require an assortment of amenities--feeding stations, cleaning stations, toys, and the like--and you need to click through a few layers of menus to select and place each of these things, each time you create a new exhibit. Similarly, you might know that you want three Malayan tigers to populate your new tropical exhibit, but you can't just go to the list of available Malayan tigers, select the three you want, and watch as they're dramatically helicoptered in. Instead, you need to select Edit exhibit, then Animals, then Adopt new animal, then Tigers, then Malayan tiger, then choose a single tiger, three times over. As you go through these motions again and again, you rapidly start wishing that the game had a smarter, more streamlined interface."", ""The three modes of play let you approach Zoo Tycoon as either a leisurely experience or a somewhat challenging, goal-oriented one. Freeform mode gives you unlimited money and lets you build the zoo of your dreams, though you can't just go hog wild and build all the biggest exhibits with all the most exotic animals immediately. As you expand your zoo, your zoo's fame level rises, slowly giving you access to new exhibit types, species, and facilities. With unlimited funds, though, there are no impediments; you can eventually feature those scimitar oryx you've got your eyes on, but it'll take a while."", ""Challenge mode starts you off with limited funds and requires you to manage your zoo smartly if you're going to stay afloat by hiring staff, attracting crowds with advertising campaigns, and so on, though these concerns are introduced at a manageable pace, and the in-game notifications offer plenty of guidance, making this an accessible management simulation that never overwhelms. Campaign mode is similar to Challenge mode but presents you with scenarios that have specific goals you must complete within a time limit. All three of these modes can be played cooperatively online with up to three friends, and only with friends. There is no online matchmaking or even an option to host or join a public game, which makes sense given the family-friendly nature of the game and the way players need to cooperate and communicate to build a zoo that all players are happy with."", ""There's a lot to like about Zoo Tycoon. Wandering the grounds of your zoo and interacting with animals can be a delight. And the game presents its concepts in a way that's accessible to players new to management sims, but still makes building a successful, flourishing zoo a rewarding achievement. It's just a shame that the game forces you to spend so much time bogged down in its clumsy interface, when all you want to do is build a better zoo.""]"Heidi Kemps,22-Nov-13,Mario Party: Island Tour Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mario-party-island-tour-review/1900-6415575/,7,3DS,"['When you hear ""minigame collection,"" the first game that usually springs to mind is Mario Party.

Fortunately, Mario Party: Island Tour is a raucous portable entry in the series that adds some refreshing new elements.', ""Island Tour adheres to the same structure as many of the other Mario Party games: two to four human or AI players move around a traditional board-game-style map in a competition, playing minigames for prizes and attempting to hinder other players throughout. Most Mario Party games have focused on the collecting of coins and stars to determine a winner at the end of a game, but Island Tour's boards feature different objectives and modes of play. Some, like Perilous Palace Path, simply require that you be the first to reach the goal, while others have you collecting items to see who can end the game with the most stuff. Even if the boards have a similar objective, there are other factors at play that alter gameplay significantly: Banzai Bill's Mad Mountain might let you summon a giant bullet that sends everyone in its path back several spaces, while Kamek's Magic Carpet Ride forgoes dice and assigns movement to an inventory of numbered cards, making your selections about how far to advance a strategic consideration. There's a nice bit of variety here, and the game helpfully gives ratings to luck, skill, and minigame categories when you're choosing a board to play on (though their accuracy is debatable). Most of the boards don't take too long to run through, but that's probably for the best given that the 3DS is a battery-based console, and nothing kills a party like running out of juice mid-game."", ""It's pretty easy to get things hopping, thanks to the 3DS Download Play feature. Much like Mario Party DS, Island Tour allows up to three additional players to access and enjoy the full game in multiplayer, even if they don't have their own copy. It takes a few minutes to send the game to other 3DSs--and, of course, they can't keep it once the host disconnects--but after the wait is over, the players have access to the entire game (though the host player controls all the settings and selections). It's a nice way to ensure that there's always an opportunity to get a party started as long as everybody has a system. Unfortunately, there's no way to play online. Yes, Mario Party is more fun in a local, group setting, but the omission of any sort of online option is puzzling, especially given that the 3DS supports friends lists and voice chat."", ""If you've got a party of one, however, Island Tour has a special single-player mode called Bowser's Tower. In this mode, your chosen character scales a tower, playing a minigame on each floor and winning to proceed. On every fifth floor, you face a boss character, and these fights are minigames in themselves. Compared to the single-player story mode in Mario Party DS, Bowser's Tower is weak: there's no variation on events depending on character choice; it takes a long time to complete a runthrough (and, if you're really unlucky, a bad roulette spin can send you back to the start); and you have to finish it more than once to unlock everything. Yet Bowser's Tower is a nice diversion, and as you play and complete board runs, Bowser's Tower, and individual minigames in either single- or multiplayer, you earn points that you can spend on unlockable content. "", 'But the meat of any Mario Party is its minigame menagerie, and Island Tour has more winners than duds in its mix. While you have the expected minigames of the ""collect stuff,"" ""knock other players off a platform,"" and ""dodge things coming at you"" varieties, there are some more inventive offerings that make good use of the 3DS hardware. Since the 3DS offers a variety of control methods--controller, buttons, stylus, microphone, and gyroscopic motion--the minigames can use one or more of these elements to make more interesting snack-size experiences. This leads to some neat outings, such as Buzz a Fuzzy (a motion- and circle-pad-controlled archery minigame) and Match Faker (a memory-type game that lets you use the stylus to take notes). The game takes advantage of the fact that each player has their own display, resulting in things like the third-person, arena-based blasting in Tanks a Lot and the hyper-gliding ice racing in No Traction Action. There are even a few auxiliary minigames that use the oft-forgotten 3DS AR cards. Unlike in Wii Party, where only one player could use the GamePad, everybody is on equal footing with the same controls and view, and many of the minigames do a good job of both recognizing and taking advantage of that in their design.', ""But there are still some stinkers in the mix. Strictly luck-based minigames turn up in the rotation frequently, and they're not any fun. A few others feature sluggish controls that hamper your ability to move well. (In minigames that involved moving the system along with another control method, I found that the game had an obnoxious tendency to lose calibration when it shifted back to motion controls, which required an experience-interrupting recalibration.) Though you can switch between preset standard and easy minigames and turn mic-using games on or off, you still can't disable individual minigames or make a custom set, which is a disappointing oversight."", ""It's not a perfect party by any means, but some good design considerations, better-than-average variety, and always-enjoyable Mario thematics put Mario Party: Island Tour a few notches above your average video game bash-in-a-box. It's nicely portable, uses the hardware well, and has a mostly good minigame mix, making this the easy-to-play multiplayer vacation you've been looking for.""]"Britton Peele,21-Nov-13,Redshirt Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/redshirt-review/1900-6415574/,6,PC,"[""In the future, social networking is still a big deal. It's mandatory, in fact. Your account on Spacebook, the proprietary social network of space station Megalodon-9, doesn't just let you share your life; it dictates it. The food you eat, the activities you take part in, the people you befriend, the dates you go on--it's all dictated by buttons on a screen. Everything is a few clicks away."", ""It would all be very sad if it wasn't also quite funny. Redshirt is a sci-fi life simulation that puts you in the role of a titular redshirt--you know, one of the guys in sci-fi shows that is always sent to die first. You're a bit player in this space opera, not a member of the main cast, so there's no guarantee that you will survive any tragedy that might strike. And rest assured, tragedy is coming."", 'So what else do you have to do other than be on Spacebook all day?', ""The entire game is played through this fake social network. Each day you are allotted a certain number of action points to put toward your daily activities, which can have varying effects on your stats, your interests, your health (both physical and mental), and your relationships. The most obvious benefits are in the types of jobs you can apply for. Getting a better job means more money and a higher rank among the space station's residents. However, better-paying jobs can also have a negative effect on your health, which in turn means you need to spend time relaxing with friends (or alone) rather than working yourself to death. It's a time management balancing act."", ""You don't get those kinds of dynamic relationships in many other games."", 'Everything can come down to your relationships with others to the extent that Redshirt is almost more dating sim than anything else. Don\'t get too attached, though, because plenty of your acquaintances die before the end (you\'re all redshirts, after all), but if the right people like you, you can schmooze your way into jobs you aren\'t otherwise eligible for or relationships with very important people. In addition to ""normal"" activities, your action points can be spent on seemingly mundane tasks such as ""liking"" a friend\'s Spacebook status. It might seem like a waste of time (especially considering how little free time you have on the game\'s weekdays), but Spacebook interactions can be critical to making new friends and fostering important relationships.', ""Using relationships for personal gain can backfire, however. In one instance, the hiring manager of a job I wanted (but was not quite qualified for) showed a romantic interest in me. I didn't feel the same way, but Redshirt had already taught me that being a despicable person can sometimes pay off. In fact, I was able to sleep my way to another job earlier, so why not use the same tactic again? So I went out with the guy. The next day, I applied for the job, which the game told me I was a shoo-in for based on how the hiring manager felt about me."", 'I quickly found myself with a denied promotion request, a loss of much happiness, and an angry ex-boyfriend who promised to ""end me.""', ""And that's awesome. You don't get those kinds of dynamic relationships in many other games. Even if you choose not to be a horrible excuse for life and try to treat everyone you meet with respect, there is a lot to consider when making choices about whom to interact with. You don't get much in the way of dialogue choices, but your time can be precious to a lot of people other than yourself. Friends often get jealous if you stop inviting them to events, though this is occasionally frustrating when they say they want to hang out yet always seem to be busy. I guess that can be true of real life, but it's often an annoyance here."", ""The bummer is that managing all this becomes repetitive after a few hours, before you've found even one of several ways off the doomed space station. This isn't simply because you start to see the same text, the same statuses, and even the same goals over and over again (though that's unfortunately true); it's also because the actions you perform grow tiresome. Like the social network it skewers, Spacebook can be a wonderful tool for interaction that quickly devolves into the mindless act of clicking on friends' activities simply because it's the thing to do. After the first couple of times you go through a serious breakup or your friend dies on a mission, you become desensitized to the experience."", ""Like the social network it lambastes, Spacebook can be a wonderful tool for interaction that quickly devolves into the mindless act of clicking on friends' activities simply because it's the thing to do."", 'It may be fitting to the theme, but the more I was able to see the station\'s inhabitants as a means to an end, the more I found myself getting bored with the formula. Fortunately, I was pulled back into the ""just one more turn"" mentality as the end neared and I had a solid plan for escaping certain death, but too much of the middle felt like a slog. And then there\'s the ending: a picture with text that basically reads, ""Yay! You win!"" Unless any of the other ending paths are somehow less anticlimactic (I saw two of them), it\'s a disappointing conclusion to many hours of play.', 'Redshirt is most effective as a parody. Its skewering of social networking is often of the ""it\'s funny because it\'s true"" variety. Comments and status updates from Spacebook friends can be appropriately groan-inducing in ways that should feel familiar to most Facebook users. You may recognize, for instance, the incredibly cheesy public declarations of love from couples or the use of random song lyrics as a status. You realize that despite your best intentions, you somehow always end up Spacebook friends with people who are horribly racist, sexist, or otherwise terrible beings.', 'While that may sound like it hits too close to home to be entertaining, Redshirt does manage to successfully poke fun at a lot of social media\'s worst aspects, and it can be good for some genuine chuckles. It does lean a little heavily on pop culture references, some more timeless than others (the song titles ""Hail Me Maybe"" and ""Since U Been Gorn"" may soon lose their effectiveness), but much of the humor is appropriately clever.', ""The space station where Redshirt takes place is filled with people who are depressed--something it informs you of when you interact with them. It could be because their jobs suck and their deaths are probably around the corner, but it doesn't help that they spend all their time letting a computer screen dictate everything about their lives. Doing so can be harmless and enjoyable for short periods, but prolonged exposure can suck all the fun out of the experience. Kind of like Redshirt itself.""]"Heidi Kemps,21-Nov-13,AquaPazza: AquaPlus Dream Match Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/aquapazza-aquaplus-dream-match-review/1900-6415567/,7,PS3,"[' ', ""Aquapazza is a tough sell to the current fighting game crowd. It's a crossover game featuring only characters from the Japanese visual novel company Aquaplus, being released into a market where the fighting game crowd has a healthy amount of other, more established one-on-one fighters to pick from. The game's low price makes it more appealing to potential buyers, however, and for those willing to dive on in, however, there's a charming fighter beneath the unfamiliar waters."", ""The cast from Aquapazza is culled from a variety of Aquaplus' visual novel offerings, including characters from To Heart, Utawarerumono, White Album, Comic Party, Tears to Tiara, and other titles. If you recognize the names of none of these games, that's perfectly understandable--none of them have been officially made available to play in English. To all but the most seasoned otaku, Aquapazza's mostly female cast looks like a weird conglomeration of generic fantasy tropes, schoolgirls, and animal-eared folks, very few of which feature the sort of flashy, attractive designs fighting game fans adore. The merely adequate character animation and art don't do them any favors, either, and the lack of context for the source material hurts Aquapazza on more than just an initial-impression level. The story mode, which pits these characters from disparate games against each other, makes very little sense if you don't already understand the characters and their relationships with one another."", ""Where a fighting game truly lives or dies, however, is in the strength of its gameplay systems. Compared to a game like BlazBlue, Aquapazza's systems are simple, making it easier for players of all stripes to jump into, but it still has plenty of competitive meat on its bones."", ""You choose two characters: a main character and an assist character, though oddly, the assist character can never be summoned into the fight directly, nor can he or she take damage. Hits can be chained from light to heavy, and you can perform slow-moving damaging strikes that knock opponents down. Special moves are performed with the usual array of quarter-circle-forward motions and variants, while stronger super moves require more complex inputs and use either one or three stocks from a character's power gauge. Universal defensive options include an impact guard performed by pressing back as soon as your opponent's strike is about to hit (which negates chip damage and provides other benefits), a quick recovery by holding up when knocked down, and an assist-character counterattack which uses one power gauge stock. All characters have the same amount of life, and generally the same type of attack does similar damage with each character across the board. Its not tough to get the feel of how combos into special moves work, and you can start doing some basic strings from the get-go."", 'The game works to encourage you to go on the offensive by bestowing conditions of ""emotion high"" and ""emotion low"" on the fighters.', 'Where Aquapazza\'s gameplay gets interesting is in the unique capabilities of each character and assist, as well as in its ""emotion"" element. Characters move in distinct ways that factor heavily into how they are played. Double-tapping with some characters gets you a short hop forward, while others dash forward and can execute special while-running attacks. A few characters have high and double jumps; only one (Sasara) has an air dash. Still others, like perpetually book-encumbered Manaka, have unique traits in their basic walks and jumps that give them a distinct method of handling. The diversity makes simply learning the way each character moves around the screen a joy.', ""Picking an assist is also vital to your gameplay. Assists offer up to two variant attacks, each of which has distinct properties. Some attacks deal direct damage as the assist jumps into the arena, some have a delay before they hit (allowing for combo setups), some are projectiles, and some are more effective as defensive punishing attacks. Other skills don't deal direct damage to the foe but work to make it easier for you to get in and do damage, such as slowing down time, holding a foe defenseless in place, giving your basic and special attacks extra hits, or boosting your basic attacks with extra damage. There's a lot of potential strategy and synergy in creating a player/assist team, and the degree to which assists affect the gameplay makes Aquapazza stand out. Some assists are better suited to certain characters than others (using a combo-focused assist isnt a good idea with a grappler character like Tamaki), so picking the right assist--and knowing when to use it--can give you a strong edge. They can also be extremely useful in extending combos, leading to clever strings of damage that leave foes hurting and you with a wicked smile on your face."", 'Another particularly interesting conceit is the emotion system. The game works to encourage you to go on the offensive by bestowing conditions of ""emotion high"" and ""emotion low"" on the fighters. When you\'re attacking and racking up combos and super hits, your emotions will rise, eventually putting you in a state of ""emotion high,"" where your damage is augmented, your attacks cause more blockstun, and your super moves get additional animations and an increase in potency. Emotion low, meanwhile, is triggered when you block, backdash, or otherwise avoid aggressively engaging the opponent for long stretches of time, and greatly increases the damage you take, as well as your odds of getting guardbroken. Certain defensive skills, like impact guard and assist counterattacks, can affect your emotion positively, making them vital to learn and use. This aspect of the game keeps battles moving quickly and encourages you to not only be active, but to learn and use a full range of skills. It\'s an interesting game of seesaw: You wont want to turtle and wait for openings, but instead to go all-out and find ways to force opponents into a state in which their characters emotions will degrade.', ""The package features some well-thought-out extras. Training mode comes with a robust set of features, including recording and playback and detailed input and damage info, but also allows you to quickly swap characters and assists without needing to back all the way into the selection screen. Changing control setups is highly convenient and still surprisingly underused among fighting games in general. Online play is solid, with a wealth of collectable titles to assign to your profile and match recording and replay features. The only thing lacking is a comprehensive tutorial for the game's mechanics; training mode features a few optional combo demonstrations, but learning the game's ins and outs requires some trial and error."", ""Aquapazza is a welcome addition to this year's fighting game releases. It's not the most immediately appealing of games, due to its uninteresting character lineup, but digging beneath the surface reveals a solid fighter that's fun to learn and play. It's unlikely to replace some of the bigger, more technical, and prettier fighters as your go-to versus game of choice, but it's a pleasant, enjoyable diversion when you need some airy, unfettered fun.""]"Mark Walton,21-Nov-13,Ryse: Son of Rome Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ryse-son-of-rome-review/1900-6415571/,4,Xbox One,"[""Ryse: Son of Rome is huge in scale, but small in scope. For all the stunning spectacle it throws at you--the sight of a hundred-strong army laying bloody waste to a barbarian horde, the march of a legion as hulking great fireballs rain down from the sky--your part in it all is that of an outlier, a lone wolf single-handedly trying to save a crumbling empire. What you're left with, then, are the scraps: small melee battles against a procession of mindless opponents who you slaughter in painfully shallow third-person combat."", ""What initially seems like an impressive system based on precision and timing, largely thanks to some nice visual cues and elegant slow-motion animations, quickly becomes an exercise in mind-numbing tedium--and with just a sword and a shield attack on offer, it's hardly surprising. Sure, there are blocks, dodges, and counters to help things along, but when you're faced with opponents whose repetitive moves you'll have seen in their entirety after the first hour of the game, it's not long before you've experienced everything the combat system has to offer and figured out a sequence to repeat ad nauseam."", ""Even the gruesome stabs and bloody dismemberments of hero Marius' quick-time finishing moves do little to ease the banality of it all. Blood is spilled with such ferocious regularity in Ryse that what was once shocking and impressive is soon reduced to just another repetitive sight to endure. Killing enemies is less and less satisfying every time you lop off another limb, and for a game that's all about the combat, that's a really big problem. It's not as if you can avoid the bloody finishing moves either, with bonuses such as health regeneration and experience boosts tied to the attacks."", ""And so battles quickly blur into one another as you're endlessly marched from one small group of opponents to another, spilling litres of barbarian blood along the way. The odd turret defense mission and sections where you march a small legion towards a tower--raising shields to avoid a flurry of fiery arrows along the way--do their best to mix things up, but these moments are short-lived and so painfully easy that you feel like you might as well not be in control of the game at all. Even the moments when it seems like the game is drawing you into the larger fight offer only the illusion of control. You can bark orders at the Kinect to unleash a flurry of arrows, or choose where you want to station your archers while you fight, but all you have to do is play such battles a few times to discover that your choices have little bearing on the battle at large."", 'Ryse is all sizzle and no steak, a stunning visage paired with a vapid personality.', ""That you're funneled into these battles along tightly controlled paths without any sense of exploration hammers home the fact that Ryse is a graphical show pony for the Xbox One, rather than a fully fleshed-out experience. Incredibly detailed cities and huge, beautiful vistas with impressive draw distances lure you into thinking that this is a living, breathing world, but as soon as you try to venture off the beaten path to explore it, you're sent crashing back to reality. Sure, many games put up invisible walls in an effort to keep the narrative and action flowing, but Son of Rome does little to disguise its limitations. You can climb up a huge towering wall one moment, only to have the savior of the Roman Empire stopped dead in his tracks seconds later by a small plank of wood. It's simply maddening."", 'With brain-dead combat playing such a large role in Ryse, it falls to the story to keep you ploughing through the battles. The trouble is that the hackneyed tale of murder and revenge is so full of cliches and iffy dialogue that it\'s hard to take it seriously. That I actually laughed out loud when Marius was asked to ""put on this hat"" to take his place as a centurion speaks volumes about the script here. Things pick up a little later in the game, particularly when you meet the wonderfully acted and thoroughly despicable sons of Emperor Nero, but for the most part, the story--like the combat--serves to showcase impressive visual touches such as the eerily good facial animation, rather than flesh out the game.', ""The online arena co-op mode mirrors the campaign's problems. The impressive-looking Colosseum is filled with spikes and obstacles, and it's there that you perform mindless missions like knocking over a cauldron to burn a catapult, or--in a wonder of originality--knocking over a cauldron to burn a pit of barbarians. It doesn't help that you're stuck using the same monotonous combat system as in the single-player game to fight off the waves of barbarians hurled at you, the only tweak being that you must choose a single bonus power such as health regeneration or strength boosts, rather than have access to them all. It's a mode you'll play once, and then never touch again."", ""Ryse is all sizzle and no steak, a stunning visage paired with a vapid personality. Everything from the leveling system that's so painfully easy to complete (and so devoid of any impact on the game that it might as well not be there), to the story that does little to flesh out its lead characters beyond puerile notions of revenge is a testament to how little Ryse can back up its gorgeous visuals with anything more than a shallow set of fisticuffs.""]"Danny O'Dwyer,20-Nov-13,FIFA 14 Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/fifa-2014-review/1900-6415568/,8,PS4 & Xbox One,"[""A rash challenge from Per Mertesacker sees my Arsenal side concede a last-minute penalty.

Behind him a wall of red and white shirts take to their feet as the walls of the Emirates Stadium shake to the boos of 50,000 vengeful Gooners. This raw, angry tension is something I've never experienced in a football game before, but in a swipe of a boot, it's over, replaced by a cacophonous roar as Szczesny dives to his right and palms the ball away to safety. When the final whistle blows a moment later, I can barely hear it over the screaming torrent of fans. I recently left London after four years of attending Arsenal games. For a brief moment, I was back."", ""While the next-gen versions of FIFA 14 retain most of the features of their current-generation siblings, the gulf in technology is immediately apparent once the teams take to the pitch. Dozens of subtle additions to the way players and fans react to each other make it a much more authentic experience. For instance, whenever a ball goes out of play, players and ball boys scurry to fetch it. Every now and again a second ball is accidentally thrown onto the pitch and must be returned before the referee will allow play to continue. The gormless doppelgangers that littered the stands in previous games have been replaced with detailed and varied fans that sway to the beat of the on-pitch action. Supporters at local derbies become embroiled in bitter chanting battles, and cup game underdogs shriek for the full time whistle. Stadium seats may lie empty if the opposition isn't worth the ticket price, while away team goals will silence any cheering home fans. This isn't the first time a football game has attempted to capture the magic of the stadium experience, but FIFA 14 for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One is the first where I've genuinely felt the presence of a 12th man."", ""The 11 on the pitch have been given new life, too. Though the game controls similarly to the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions, there's a noticeable increase in the variety of animations and fluidity of motion. The entire experience is a lot less mechanical. The ball no longer sticks to your feet, so jostling for control and shielding possession are far more interesting. This freedom of movement also allows you to intercept passes and put pressure on individual players more effectively, so changes in possession occur more often. An interesting by-product of this increased jostling is that referees are more lenient. The familiar whistle blows after blocking off players or roughing them out of possession aren't here. And though sometimes it can seem the referees have thrown away the rulebook, the pace of the match benefits overall. While past games in the series have more accurately mimicked the offensive back-and-forth of a game of basketball, possession in FIFA 14 is a lot less predictable."", ""The PlayStation 4 version of FIFA 14 comes with a multitude of other improvements. Impressively fast load times mean you barely have enough time to complete the loading screen skill games. The increase in resolution and graphical fidelity is apparent throughout. Better detail allows you to notice player balance and ball spin like never before, while jerseys ruffle and grass clippings are kicked up when players strike at goal. You can also press in the DualShock 4's touchpad, or the Xbox One's back button to switch control to the goalkeeper. It's not a very useful addition, but at the very least, it serves as an alternative to hammering Y to rush the goalie out in one-on-one situations."", ""Whether you're scoring in front of a screaming Kop or eking out an unlikely cup victory, FIFA 14 produces special moments that will live in your memory."", 'Off the pitch, FIFA 14 has a variety of modes which will be familiar to anyone who has played the series recently, but sadly, several of them have not made the cut between console generations. You can still play friendlies or take control of an individual player in Be a Pro. Career mode lets you manage a variety of teams or start a career as a player. Ultimate Team returns for fans of building their very own fantasy sides. Skill games and the practise mode are back, Pro Clubs allows you to create an online team with friends, and single-player or co-op seasons are available via Seasons mode.', 'However, there are some disappointing omissions. Tournament mode is nowhere to be seen, which means the many leagues and cups that make up world football are not playable independently. So if you want to enter the World Cup, take your team to the top of the Premier League, or compete in the Copa del Rey, your only choice is to invest hours into Career mode.', ""Latin American soccer fans will be disappointed to hear that Mario Kempes and Fernando Palomo's commentary is not in the next-gen version either. Unranked online friendlies have also been taken out, as has the ability to allow guests to play online with you. All in all, this means the local co-op play experience has been rather handicapped. It's a disappointing blot on an otherwise outstanding product."", ""Regardless, this is the quintessential version of FIFA 14. It brings a level of authenticity never before seen in the genre and sets new standards for player control and stadium atmosphere. Too often have we seen football games flounder in the transition to new consoles, but FIFA 14 for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One is a step above it's peers.

I've always bought into the whole argument that it's the place where we're all going to spend the rest of our lives (thank you, Criswell), and box-office receipts alone show the widespread appeal of looking forward to see if we're going to wind up in an irradiated wasteland or a Blade Runner-style ennui-opolis loaded with neon signs and noodle shops. So it isn't much of a surprise that the first expansion pack for SimCity is Cities of Tomorrow, which reskins the game with sci-fi buildings and technology. But while this snazzy new face-lift has been pulled off with enough skill to please even the most wrinkled Hollywood starlet, virtually none of the flaws inherent in the core game design have been addressed."", 'Cities of Tomorrow is something of a ""more of the same"" add-on. SimCity gameplay has been preserved for the most part, but accentuated with futuristic touches and technology that allow you to take your towns into the future. Granted, this is a future that still features ridiculously small city borders, an unhealthy emphasis on multiplayer, and the same old always-on Internet connection that alienated so many fans last spring, but hey, it\'s got all that plus mag-lev trains and robot drones now, so take the good future with the bad future.', 'All of the tweaks in this add-on collectively let you evolve past the current era into a shimmery future that represents the later 21st century and beyond. The biggest symbol of this leap forward is the MegaTower, a cloud-touching superstructure that lets you fit almost all city accommodations and services under one roof. Forget about the crippled zoning mechanics in the original SimCity; you can place residential, mall, office, park, security, waste collection, and other specialized levels into single buildings. You can even top everything off with something eye-catching, like big neon signs, parks, or tourist-drawing lookouts.', ""But even though building up, not out, would seem to be a good way to handle the tiny municipal footprints that are still imposed on city-builders, I had serious problems with how to use MegaTowers in my personal cities of tomorrow. Their sheer size remains an issue. Each tower occupies a tremendous amount of space, which means that you have to cram them into cities by demolishing huge sections of your original layout. Figure on getting rid of a good four square blocks of residential development to plop down just one tower, which really exacerbates the demolition-happy design of the original game. Don't go all future on an existing city if you have any emotional attachment to it, because the old place will be gone in no time."", ""You're left with a game that hides the same dissatisfying experience under a more attractive surface."", ""MegaTower economics are also hard to get a handle on. They're awfully hard to fit into a budget. Unlike residential and commercial developments, which spring up instantly on somebody else's dime after you lay down streets and zoning, MegaTowers cost huge bucks for their initial builds and then for each level that you add on to them. Because of this, they are suitable to use only later in games, once you've done pretty much all you can with the old-style structures and are looking for new challenges. That can be disappointing if you're buying this add-on expecting to instantly time-travel to a century or so in the future."", ""I tried forgoing all traditional residential and commercial development in favor of a MegaTower right at the start of building a new city, forgoing all traditional residential and commercial development for a MegaTower, and almost immediately went broke without that traditional revenue. I'm not sure what the issue is: the added building cost, that towers generate less tax revenue, or some other mysterious problem. Where you can see how well you're doing with homes and stores just by looking at them and clicking to pull up info screens, tower levels are impossible to get a visual read on. Also, MegaTowers have been jammed into one budget line item instead of being treated as separate residential and commercial options like their old-fashioned counterparts (a move that makes no sense, since the tower levels are just homes and stores and offices in a different cosmetic form), which makes things even more confusing."", ""Other big additions are OmegaCo and the Academy. OmegaCo revolutionizes everything. It's a vaguely sinister omni-corporation making a vaguely sinister unspecified product called Omni that starts as an alternative industry and soon infects just about everything with franchises and drones that do much of the grunt work in this technological wonderland. You can make big bucks with Omega, although you need a huge flow of oil and ore to keep this great mystery product going, and a pretty seriously developed traditional economy before it makes sense to go in this direction. The Academy is sort of a super-university that expands SimCity gameplay farther toward a Civilization-like feel. Invest big here, and you create ControlNet, a Wi-Fi-style resource needed to power high-tech buildings. The Academy also serves as the home of research, where you can discover tech that leads to new structures such as a fusion power plant, sewage recyclers that churn out drinkable water, garbage atomizers, and so forth."", 'Granted, this is a future that still features ridiculously small city borders, an unhealthy emphasis on multiplayer, and the same old always-on Internet connection that alienated so many fans last spring.', ""Again, there are some interesting ideas here. But all come with huge price tags and generally have equally monstrous footprints. It's hard to afford them and even harder to find enough empty space to plop them down in your cities. Almost all of the new options are geared toward players who have hit the limits of the original game and need new challenges. You're also forced to create specialized cities throughout entire regions more than ever. The size of the new structures makes it necessary to branch out to three or four regional cities, either through taking them over yourself when playing privately or by dealing with other human mayors in multiplayer. So if you're hoping to serve as the somewhat realistic mayor of one futuristic megalopolis, sorry, but it isn't happening here."", 'A few bugs make the future look not quite so bright in spots. I encountered various odd issues. ControlNet sometimes would not connect to certain buildings, no matter how much money I was generating. Mining facilities occasionally would not hook up to water, regardless of how much I supplied, even if I plopped high-tech hydro towers practically right on top of them. Only demolishing and rebuilding on the same spot cleared up the problem. I was sometimes unable to run pipes from Omega factories to the newfangled pods that automatically delivered oil and ore. I would set everything up perfectly, with no overlaps, right over a source of the natural resource in question, but then not be allowed to place a pod for reasons unknown or get an error message about not being able to build on a road, when there was no road in the way.', ""Everything does look great, though. Plop down some MegaTowers, and they create a sky-high neighborhood straight out of the Coruscant Imperial City planet of the Star Wars prequels, with little terra firma to be seen and huge floating neon signs all over the place. Old-fashioned buildings develop futuristic looks over time, too. Every time you add some Cities of Tomorrow sci-fi tech to the landscape, the old structures respond by growing what look to be long neon tubes. Zoom in at night, and the city streets look like something out of Tron. The developers seem to have taken design inspiration from a lot of old sci-fi movies. All of the Academy buildings and mag-lev trains reminded me of the domed city in Logan's Run."", ""The gorgeous sci-fi burgs in Cities of Tomorrow prove that beauty only runs skin-deep. Once you get bored with the neon-clad gimmicks of the MegaTowers and OmegaCo, you're left with pretty much the same flawed game that annoyed the city-building community last spring. Given how loud the critics were back then, it's disappointing that Maxis and EA did little to address any of these gripes, particularly the restricted city borders.

Five players glide across the court as one, shifting positions to ensure the best spacing possible against the disruptive mass of opponents trying to stifle their progress. When properly orchestrated, it's a sight to behold. Power infused with creativity, grace and tactics holding hands, concluding in a dramatic showcase with seemingly endless possibilities. NBA Live 14 understands the essentials, the passing and shooting that are the dominant verbs of the sport. But it fails to replicate the artistry of the game, the brilliance that draws us to professional competition or the joy that beckons us to the local gym. Because the sloppy action of NBA Live 14 never coalesces into a satisfying whole, this is just a pale echo of the real thing, basketball in name only."", ""Problems are obvious from the opening tip-off. The players you have gone hoarse rooting for, who have worn silly suits to the NBA Draft and mistakenly hired Jay-Z to be their agent, are nowhere to be found. Rather, there are manufactured approximations, mannequins who have been given one night to step down from their plastic pedestals to play basketball. Their movements are stiff and unnatural, their feet hovering slightly above the court, never gaining proper traction. It's unnerving to see LeBron James soar toward the basket. You see his face screaming in anger and his arms twisting at odd angles. And the ball leaves his palm before he even completes his shooting motion. This is the man who drew the ire of an entire Midwestern city and swore to the league that he would win seven championships?"", ' ', ""NBA Live is an eyesore. It's a vestige of an ugly past that we thought had been banished to the ether, but it's not because of its looks that it's so unsatisfying. Rather, it's how the inhuman animations and inconsistent physics affect the action that relegates NBA Live to the development league. Players hoist ugly shots no matter where they stand on the floor, unperturbed by the defender standing nearby who happily swats a souvenir to a lucky member of the crowd. If you replay that shot, which is going to make every highlight reel, you may notice something peculiar: the defender's hand doesn't have to touch the ball. Point guards deliver awkward passes to cutting players, giving you as much chance of completing a pass in traffic as Dwight Howard has for making a foul shot. And don't worry about boxing out. Rebounds ricochet wildly off rims, so just hope the ball falls in your hands."", ""It's unnerving to see LeBron James soar toward the basket. You see his face screaming in anger and his arms twisting at odd angles.

Set up a pick-and-roll with David West and Paul George to watch the two men, along with their two defenders, stick together as if coated by glue. If West should break free of the morass, he adjusts his position after receiving the pass, turning a sure 12-footer into a 20-foot shot of desperation. If you ignore the pick-and-roll game, one of the most used plays in the NBA, and work the post, there are even more problems. Big men stumble like Shaq after an all-you-can-eat barbecue. Rolling smoothly toward the basket or flashing across the lane for a hook shot is so clunky that you're more likely to turn the ball over than score. So you need to become a brute. Slam repeatedly into the defender, and when he falls, hope that you gain the benefit of the whistle rather than chalk up another charge."", ' ', ""Inconsistencies infect the very logic of NBA Live 14. In Rising Star mode, you create a rookie, prove your worth in an amateur game, and then wait anxiously for a decent team to call your name on draft night. I was banished to Cleveland. There's nothing wrong with playing for the Cavaliers, but as a shooting guard, I knew that I would be riding the pine behind Dion Waiters, who was drafted last year. Turns out that NBA Live doesn't care one lick about reality. On opening night, I was already in the starting lineup, even though I had played like a dog in the one game before the regular season began. Sorry Dion! In my second game, my goal was to have a better grade than James Harden. With Kobe Bryant nursing a torn Achilles and Dwyane Wade perpetually ailing, Harden is the best shooting guard in the league. That Live wants me to be better than Harden in my second game shows just how poorly this approaches the real game."", 'Slam repeatedly into the defender, and when he falls, hope that you gain the benefit of the whistle rather than chalk up another charge.', ""How do you achieve a high grade? Play smart team basketball, of course. For instance, when I drained a wild half-court shot two minutes into the third quarter, my grade went up, because that's just fundamentally sound basketball. For the most part, the grading scale is much smarter than that half-court snafu would indicate. You're rewarded for throwing good passes and shutting down your opponent on the defensive end, but there are enough problems that you're never quite sure how you stack up. You may find yourself switching to a player you shouldn't be covering on the defensive end, or being praised for handing the ball to your center beyond the three-point arc. More troubling in Rising Star than the wacky grading scale is the AI. On the offensive end, Kyrie Irving would dribble the ball while everyone else on the team was rooted in place. And this would happen every time down the floor if I didn't run around or force him to throw a pass."", ""Venturing online only presents a whole new host of problems. There's slight lag that undermines just about any viable strategy. Just try to nail the timing of a jumper or stay in front of a driving point guard when your player reacts a beat after you hit the button. It's an exercise in failure. So the best strategy is just to drive hard to the basket on every single play. Every one. Your opponent may not realize the problems with the game. He or she may attempt to run an actual NBA offense. Well, that's not going to work. Watch your lead soar to double digits and beyond, and then your overmatched opponent is forced to hoist three-pointers in a desperate, and ill-advised, attempt to come back. My goal shifted from simply trying to win to getting my opponent to quit before halftime. Don't get me wrong; I don't take pride in exploiting a busted system. But when no other tactics worked, I had no choice but to dunk until my wrists grew tired."", ""Despite the myriad issues on and off the court, NBA Live has fantastic integration with the events of the actual league. Just days after Jeff Green shocked the Heat by draining a desperation three-pointer, Live lets you re-create the high point of the Celtics' dismal season. As a Pacers fan, I embarked on challenges specifically built for them. I could replay the Grizzlies game from earlier in the season, and try to mimic the beatdown Indiana put on Memphis. Could I hold them below 79 points and get a triple double with Lance Stephenson? The answer is no, but it's incredible to be able to try."", ""Sadly, even re-creating events from the NBA season is just a tease because the act of playing is so far from what real basketball should be. The on-court action is so sloppy and unsatisfying that even rubbing defeat in Carmelo Anthony's face loses its appeal.

Moments like this are what make Forza Motorsport 5 so special. This is a game that expertly captures the bond between car and driver, improving on a world-class racing simulation with just as much human touch as technical wizardry.', ' ', ""Nowhere is that more apparent than in Forza 5's redesigned career mode, where the hosts of Top Gear serve as entertaining guides through all manner of automotive styles and eras. It's a format made up of dozens of mini-campaigns, each focused on a specific class of vehicle, ranging from vintage touring legends to hot hatches to modern hypercars. It's a much more a la carte approach than previous Forza games: each series is unlocked from the start, lasting between one and two hours each. You're given the freedom to progress through these themed categories in any order you wish, the only limit to what you drive next being the number of credits in your virtual bank account."", ' ', ""With this approach comes the freedom to navigate your own pathway through the history of motorsport, but with an overarching progression of credits and RPG-style leveling that encourages you to continually poke through Forza 5's eclectic selection of vehicles. It's a career mode made even better by an expanded Top Gear partnership that takes the form of narrated voice-overs preceding each series. Whether they're playfully mocking the third generation of Ford Mustangs or recounting the rivalry between James Hunt and Niki Lauda during the 1976 Formula One season, Clarkson, Hammond, and May shine as automotive historians. Their entertaining yet informative prologues lend both context and humor to every category of car you choose to spend time with."", ' ', ' ', ""That same flair for personality can be seen in the new drivatar AI system. The idea is that each car you compete against throughout your career is modeled after a real player's driving habits, a sort of cloud-based doppelganger meant to reflect how aggressive a person is in the pack or how well they can negotiate the trickiest of chicanes. Exactly how accurate these portraits are is up for debate, but the system does succeed in filling each 16-car grid with distinct personalities, drivers whose tendencies you can never take for granted. Their mistakes are far less predictable than the vanilla AI of previous games--especially when you reduce their penchant for aggression by climbing the ladder of eight difficulty settings--making those moments you capitalize on their errors that much more rewarding. There are odd AI hiccups here and there, like when they side-swipe you in the straights for no apparent reason, but such goofs are rare and nothing that a quick tap of the rewind button can't solve."", 'This is a game that expertly captures the bond between car and driver, improving on a world-class racing simulation with just as much human touch as technical wizardry', ""All of this amounts to a career mode that feels more lively and personable than anything Forza has done in the past. There are faults, though. A sense of repetition can creep in thanks to a track list roughly half the size of that found in Forza 4, already a game that carried a profound sense of environmental deja vu. But those tracks that did make the cut have received the full next-gen treatment. Classics like Laguna Seca and Silverstone are significant improvements over their prior iterations in terms of both look and feel, bristling with race day atmosphere and up-to-date tweaks to track layouts. And then there are the new circuits: the sloping forest hills of Spa-Francorchamps, the classical European streets of Prague, and the demanding ascent of Mount Panorama. These excellent additions don't remove the sting from the modest track count, but they do serve as wonderful complements to the stable of well-updated classics."", ' ', ""Easier to forgive is Forza 5's reduced car count. While smaller overall, this is the broadest assortment of vehicles the series has ever seen, highlighted by the introduction of open-wheel Formula One and IndyCars. Piloting a 750-horsepower Lotus E21 mere inches above the asphalt is an experience every bit as exhilarating as it is terrifying, making you feel as though any switch on that cockpit could send you rocketing into outer space. But whether you're cruising around in a Ford Focus or a McLaren P1, every car in the game's catalog looks absolutely remarkable--both in their pristine showroom forms as well as those post-race close-ups where flecks of grime litter the exterior and scratches adorn the disc brakes."", ' ', ""Indeed, Forza 5 has hardly forgotten its roots as a racing sim known for its staggering dedication to realism. Improved tire physics give you a better sense of your car's shifting weight as you barrel through sloped corners, while a clever implementation of the Xbox One trigger rumble delivers valuable haptic feedback about your current traction and stability levels. But as with previous games, Forza 5 is only as demanding as you want it to be. A generous collection of driving assists allows you to settle into your own personal comfort zone on the track, with rewards for ratcheting up the difficulty and penalties for overusing the rewind function."", ' ', ""But a steadfast dedication to racing physics is only part of the story. Forza 5 is a game brimming with audiovisual flourishes, little touches that elevate the driving experience just as much as the underlying science. The way sunlight comes flooding through your windshield as you race across the Prague circuit's cobblestone bridge, or the excellent orchestral soundtrack that makes each race feel like the climax of a James Bond movie--Forza 5 is an absolutely beautiful game full of immersive detail. And nowhere is that more visible than in the remarkable cockpit views, where intricate stitch work and high-resolution textures serve as rich palettes for the game's drastically improved lighting effects. Even the Dolby cassette deck on a '92 Golf GTi is a thing of beauty."", ' ', ""Forza 5 goes out of its way to ensure that every feature carried over from previous games has seen meaningful improvements. The Autovista mode that debuted in Forza 4 (renamed Forzavista here) has expanded from a handful of cars to the game's entire roster, making it easy to lose time ogling your latest purchase from every conceivable angle. Rivals mode remains an exciting means of challenging your friends' best lap times, but now it has been fully integrated into the career mode so that you're automatically presented with a new lap time to beat even as you're racing your way toward your next extravagant supercar. Even the livery editor has been expanded with new vinyls and surface materials, giving you the opportunity to defy all that is holy by designing a wood-grain Ferrari 458 Italia, or a Lexus LFA made entirely of brushed copper."", ' ', ""Unfortunately, I had limited access to Forza 5's multiplayer in the game's prerelease review state, with only the option to choose between a pair of hoppers for A- and S-class cars respectively. But my time competing against other players revealed a stable networking environment (thanks in some part to the game's dedicated servers, no doubt) and a lovely matchmaking system that lets you tinker around in any mode you please while it searches for an acceptable match."", ' ', ""All of this combined makes Forza Motorsport 5 an outstanding improvement to an already excellent racing franchise. It's far more than just a great racing sim, or a gorgeous showcase for the types of feats the Xbox One hardware is capable of.

To that end, you're not just a gamer when you're playing Tearaway; you're a godlike presence, representing both the ultimate goal and the protagonist."", ""In essence, then, you play two roles. One of those roles is as a sentient envelope on a mission. Your first decision is to take the reins of either the male envelope Iota or the female envelope Atoi. (Note the playful spelling trick.) Iota or Atoi becomes the protagonist, the driving force behind the narrative and the personality that other characters interact with. No matter which one you choose, the end goal is the same. Reach the sun--that's all you have to do. The twist is that the sun is you. Yes, you, the player."", ""Through the magic of the PS Vita's front camera, your face appears within the outline of the sun and becomes the visual embodiment of the second of your two roles. You smile; sun smiles. You frown; sun frowns. You point your Vita at your dog; sun becomes a dog. An ugly visage (in your case, perhaps less ugly) intruding and bearing down on the papercraft environment causes a bit of an understandable stir, so Iota (or Atoi) sets out to find the meaning behind and origin of the thing from another world."", 'And thus begins an adventure of surprising depth given the paper-thin building blocks. The immediate pull of Tearaway is the quality and charm of the visuals, sucking you in to what is a traditional 3D platformer at heart. Every element used to create every level, character, and collectible could realistically be made for real with only coloured paper, scissors, and a stick of glue. Not only is this playful aesthetic inviting, but it fundamentally enhances the link between the digital and the real.', ""Much of what is present can be customised to suit your own tastes and mood. Some form of customisation was always to be expected given developer Media Molecule's Little Big Planet roots, but the approach here is very different. While the Sackboy experience concentrated on the large-scale creation of worlds and even entire game experiences, Tearaway takes the approach of letting you customise rather than build. Your hero's appearance, for example, can be altered as frequently and as wildly as you like. This can be achieved using either the preset shapes or the virtual paper-cutting tools that allow you to design your own elements from scratch, layering sheets of coloured paper to create more complex and more colourful objects. Additionally, you're frequently asked to design the look of many of the game's more important items and lead characters."", 'Every form of interaction is executed with skill and expert pacing, and never does one element outstay its welcome.', ""One early section sees you riding an energetic pig through a valley--an everyday task for many, I'm sure, apart from the fact that the pig can be altered before you start. Give it four eyes, a Santa Claus beard, and an oversized crown of gold and gems, or simply give it fangs. A hedonist pig... a vamporker... nothing is out of bounds. Remember that you're not just the protagonist; you're the god of this world, and a pig will look how you want it to look. Your all-powerful status extends to gameplay that makes full and excellent use of the Vita's unique features. Many past Vita games have failed to implement the handheld's touch capabilities and tilt functions in any meaningful way. Thankfully, Tearaway never feels gimmicky or anything less than an excellent example of incorporated design."", 'Like the visuals, the touch and tilt controls only serve to more thoroughly break down the barriers between our world and that of our handicraft hero. Tapping on the rear touchpad allows you to poke virtual fingers through certain parts of the world, which is great for dispatching enemies and moving obstacles too large for Iota and Atoi to move with their flimsy paper-thin bodies. The front screen can be used to pull parts of the scenery apart in a bid to unlock hidden areas or unroll paper to create bridges across gaps and over obstacles, while specific enemy types also require front screen interaction for you to to finish them off completely. Both front and rear cameras are used regularly to distinguish your world from that of other Tearaway players, while the gyroscopic tilt functions are reserved for slightly (very slightly) more challenging sequences later in the game.', ""Every form of interaction is executed with skill and expert pacing, and never does one element outstay its welcome or feel as though it takes away from the onscreen action. The mere fact that the controls feel normal is evidence enough that, when done right, each and every one of the Vita's features can be used in tandem and as a means to elevate gameplay. The traditional input combination of buttons and sticks allow for a set of basic and intuitive movements and actions. There's nothing here that rocks the 3D platformer boat, with jump, roll, pick up, and throw all present and accounted for. It's impossible to be cynical about the limited range of motions, however, given the overwhelming cute factor exuded by the aesthetic and the touch controls. "", ""It's easier to be cynical about other aspects, though. While Tearaway's levels are the ideal length for a handheld game (none take longer than 15 to 20 minutes), there are simply not enough of them to keep you entertained for long. A couple of extended play sessions is enough to finish a complete playthrough. Hunting out all of the hidden collectibles and photographing points of interest give you reasons to return, but there's nothing on offer that is especially taxing, and you will probably find the vast majority of items with relative ease."", ""Tearaway's most lasting feature is not within the game itself, but through the inclusion of printable blueprints. Through standard progression and by taking photographs of certain objects, you earn blueprints that allow you to create your own origami editions of your favourite elements from within the game. Be warned, though, that even when you follow the instructions, some of these are incredibly tricky propositions, but if you've got the patience, it's worth the effort to take the theme of connecting worlds to that next step. The fact that it's so tempting to spend time creating these paper models is a testament to how appealing and attractive Tearaway is. It's just a shame that one of the Vita's best experiences feels as long as a piece of paper is thick.""]"Cameron Woolsey,19-Nov-13,Risk of Rain Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/risk-of-rain-review/1900-6415566/,8,PC,"[' ', ""Risk of Rain is the kind of game that speaks to the compulsive hoarder inside all of us.

Discovering new items is a ton of fun, and finding out what they do and figuring out the best method to use them provides some element of strategy. You can find one that projects a damaging aura, for instance, and another that freezes your shots. Some items increase weapon damage or firing speed, while others are passive, increasing cash flow with every kill or healing you out of battle. Items are stackable, which increases their potency or speed of activation. Finding one item that lets you fire a random missile is great, but picking up the same item many more times has you sending out a barrage of missiles during enemy encounters.

The tables can turn in an instant, so both combatants have to pay close attention."", 'At any point during a combo, the defender may attempt a combo breaker. If successful, this move instantly interrupts the combo, creating some space between you and the attacker. Otherwise you trigger a lock out and be prevented from trying again for a few seconds--at which point your opponent may gleefully pummel you without concern. Layered on top of this system are the counter breakers, which are used by the attacker to break combo breakers. They also cost half of your total energy, and if used at the wrong time leave you wide open to counter attack.', ""The interplay between these two systems--and trying to predict when your opponent will use them--adds an engaging layer of mind games to the traditionally one-sided process of building a combo. Successfully predicting when exactly a breaker will happen means really getting into the other person's head--and when you do, it's extremely satisfying."", 'While Killer Instinct\'s combat mechanics are accommodating to a wide breadth of players, the game doesn\'t go far enough to hold the interest of lone players. Versus, survival, dojo, and practice modes make up the game\'s offline offerings, and while they all function as expected, they also represent the minimum standard for the genre. For fighting game veterans with access to a reliable source of competition, this is not a huge issue. But those looking for a strong narrative-focused mode, or for more of a reason to keep playing than ""practice for online play,"" will be left wanting.', ""Dojo mode is Killer Instinct's main educational mode. Consisting of 32 different lessons, this mode runs you through the basics of movement, the combo system, and the art of counter breaker mind games. There are even some helpful lessons on how to interpret frame data and set up frame traps, two topics that are extremely important for skilled play but are rarely explained in other fighting games. But while the content of these lessons is great, the information is presented in a very dry style that feels akin to reviewing a checklist than learning the game's mechanics."", ""Once you feel confident in your skills, it's time to take the fight online. Far and away, the most important aspect is performance, and thankfully, in all of our testing, online matches ran smoothly. This is especially important since the game doesn't display the ping for the opponent you're facing, denying you the ability to manually filter challengers based on connection speed. Much like the game's offline modes, Killer Instinct's online offerings are just the essentials of player and ranked matches, as well as a leaderboard."", 'An unfortunate omission in this lineup is not being able to watch matches between other players, which is an excellent way to improve your own abilities. Killer Instinct keeps recordings of your most recent matches both online and off, but does not provide a list of other players\' replays to download in the game. The Xbox One console lets you record and upload short clips from the game, a feature with amazing potential as an educational tool but one that needs more granular filtering options than ""epic fail"" or ""review"" to be useful.', ""Killer Instinct successfully updates the '90s classic into a finely tuned, competitive fighter that can stand alongside the genre's regulars. Its muscle-bound roster conveyes a satisfying sense of weight and force with their movements, while still feeling responsive to your commands. There is a lot of flexibility in combo authorship, but the combo and counter breakers help keep both fighters on their toes even as the hit count rises.""]"Mark Walton,19-Nov-13,Super Mario 3D World Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/super-mario-3d-world-review/1900-6415544/,9,Wii U,"[""Super Mario 3D World is a game of exceptional craft, of painstaking focus on the minute details that are integral to making it feel special. The pace at which you're thrown from one ingenious concept to the next as perspectives, tempos, and mechanics change would choke a lesser game, but here it's done with a seamlessness that makes such rapid inventiveness look easy. This is a game where every level is a golden nugget of heavenly platforming joy, where ideas are rarely repeated--and if they are, they're given such a twist as to make them feel new again."", ""Those ideas start with the cat suit. Once you're over the outrageous cutesy appeal of seeing Mario paw around on all fours, the new abilities it offers are intriguing. You can slash at nearby enemies instead of stomping on them, leap through the air with a swift dash attack, and scramble up walls. It's the latter that pushes you to think about new ways of solving puzzles, and to explore the extremities of a level. Bare walls that stretch up into the vertical distance are no longer the barriers they once were, with curious climbs revealing hidden pipes, paths, and glowing green stars at their peak."", ""Elsewhere, you're asked to paw at cogs, revealing tall towers for you to climb that lead to special precision platforming sections atop puffy clouds. Purple boxes transport you to timed zones, where brisk climbing and coin collecting reward you with more green stars, while flagpoles that once required a well-timed jump to earn a gold flag can be scaled with Mario's grippy paws. Some games would build an entire experience out of the cat suit alone, clever as it is, but 3D World steadfastly refuses to dwell on one idea for long."", 'Some games would build an entire experience out of the cat suit alone, clever as it is, but 3D World steadfastly refuses to dwell on one idea for long.', ""One moment you're riding on the back of an aquatic dinosaur, skimming it over the surface of a waterfall to collect coins and bouncing it off the backs of squishy puffer fish to reach stars, and the next you're using cleverly angled shadows and silhouettes to spot hidden power-ups, and blowing on the gamepad's microphone to move platforms. Another new power-up, the double cherry, creates a clone of Mario, with multiple pickups creating up to four of the portly plumbers. Puzzles start simply, requiring you to push two switches at once, but the challenge is in keeping the group alive long enough to activate platforms that need multiple characters, and to do so in the right order to reach the exit."", ""The game flows effortlessly from one ingenious idea to the next, the levels intelligently designed to gently guide you toward their concepts without the need for a heavy-handed tutorial or swathes of help boxes. More importantly, 3D World's levels are some of the most fun a Mario game has dished out in years. No, they don't quite reach the lofty heights of the sublime Super Mario Galaxy games, but the sheer joy of exploring the sharp, vibrant levels, solving puzzles, and simply leaping from one platform to the next, backed by the game's surgical precision, is exuberant."", ""A top-down world map, similar to that of the classic Super Mario Bros. 3, guides you from one level to the next, ensuring that you're never left wondering where to get your next dose of platforming action. The twist is that you can deviate from the set path and explore the wide-open space of the overworld. Bonus slot machines spit out coins, Toadstool huts bombard you with power-ups, and challenging secret levels with yet more green stars to earn are all ripe for discovery."", 'There are some unique and wonderfully designed puzzles in the form of Captain Toad levels too, which challenge you to guide the funny fungus around a rotatable 3D maze, all without the power to jump or stomp on enemies.', ""The fact that these lovely little asides are optional has always been a strength of the Mario series. Defeating Bowser and rescuing the adorable Sprixie fairies is an attainable goal for all but the most ham-fisted of players, and even then, the golden tanooki suit always ensures there's a path forward if you get stuck. But if you want to push the limits of your skills, to explore levels that drop you onto fierce rotating platforms, and in front of fiery, cog-filled paths, the option to try to attain all the stars and collectible stamps and gold flags on every level is there."", ""The most challenging levels in 3D World prove to be some of the most creative and off the wall, effortlessly balancing intricacy and design elegance. The imagination that's on show across the game's level design, its gorgeous visuals, and its wonderful soundtrack is intoxicating, constantly pushing you to discover new ways of playing. Even the boss battles, while adhering to many of the series' tropes, are fresh and exciting as a result of some clever mechanics and some wonderful visual trickery. You can also share the experience with four-player co-op, which is a more compelling proposition than before thanks to individual high scores and the brag-worthy addition of a shiny gold crown for the leader."", ""Sure, co-op play is hardly a game changer, but when so much of 3D World is so successfully built upon a bevy of brilliant ideas, this can be forgiven. Everything that you can see and do within its enchanting levels is so bright, colourful, and full of wonder that it's impossible not to be taken in by its charms. Mario has always had that uncanny ability to cross the boundaries of age and gender, to bring a smile to the face of every player who crosses his path. Super Mario 3D World is no different. This is a dazzlingly inventive game that brings the fun in spades, and will leave you grinning like a loon from start to finish.""]"Cameron Woolsey,18-Nov-13,Deadfall Adventures Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/deadfall-adventures-review/1900-6415563/,3,PC,"['In many games, you unlock ancient discoveries and acquire grand treasures as a reward. But not all tombs offer something grandiose, and a long trek down a musty corridor may sometimes yield disappointment.', ""Deadfall Adventures is one such trek. The game draws its history from H.R. Haggard's Allan Quatermain series of adventure novels written in the late 1800s, but the plot of Deadfall Adventures bears a closer resemblance to the Indiana Jones movie--which were in part inspired by Haggard's books--than to Haggard's books themselves. Set in 1938, Deadfall Adventures stars Allan's great-grandson, James Quatermain, a hard-drinking, hard-fighting adventurer who must keep an all-powerful ancient artifact from Nazis who will use its power to gain an edge in the upcoming world war. Similarities to the Indiana Jones movies don't end there, as familiar traps and even a minecart ride that barrels through caverns and over bubbling pools of lava make an appearance. But Deadfall Adventures' biggest problem isn't familiarity: it's tedium. "", ""Deadfall Adventures feels like a game out of its time. It relies on tired, two-dimensional characters to tell its all-too-familiar story. The rugged Quatermain is paired with Jennifer Goodwin, a tough and flirtatious love interest, and the two are pitted against melodramatic comic book villains. Wooden voice acting and emotionless facial animations put a damper on the presentation, and Quatermain himself is lost as to what period of time he's in. He occasionally spouts references to Indiana Jones, which merit little more than an eye roll, but sometimes he says or quotes phrases that are completely out of place. Despite living many decades before, Quatermain seems to have no qualms shouting lines from The Terminator and, believe it or not, Darkwing Duck."", 'Deadfall Adventures becomes hopelessly predictable, breaking down into a tiresome formula of kill rooms and effortless puzzles.', ""Unlike The Farm 51's previous game, Painkiller: Hell & Damnation, Deadfall is slow paced, and your inventory is limited to three weapons at once, split into three categories: pistol, rifle, and special weapon. Combat revolves around shooting from cover with a variety of weapons, many of which are World War II-era firearms. Guns and ammunition are always plentiful, so Quatermain is rarely at a disadvantage. He absorbs massive amounts of damage before needing to drop behind cover to recharge his health. Enemies repeat the same animation to get out of cover, so it's entirely possible to sprint into the field of battle and take each one out like a game of Nazi Whac-a-Mole while taking little damage in the process."", ""Enemies exercise little caution in fights, only occasionally taking cover, and leaving their vulnerable bodies exposed in the process. They never seem to have any clue what they're shooting at and have a habit of shooting in your direction, even if you're in another room. It's one thing to watch a Nazi soldier fire his gun into the crate he's hiding behind, but it's a rare treat to hear the sound of rifles popping in the next room as enemies desperately try to kill you through layers of dirt and rock."", 'Deadfall Adventures delves into the supernatural by introducing mummies who spur to life to protect the homes of their ancient masters. The mummies are invulnerable at first, but you damage them by focusing your flashlight beam, which sets them on fire after a short period. I found myself enjoying fighting these undead guardians, because they at least provide some sense of danger, and they back away or shield themselves against the harmful rays of the flashlight. In the final act, mummies charge in large numbers at a breathless rate. With every encounter, you are forced into a game of finding a corner and blasting away with a shotgun, ruining one of the few things going for Deadfall Adventures.', 'Glitches plague Deadfall. You can pass through some fences or rocks, while other times, enemies are stuck running along an invisible floor. Cover in combat is often untrustworthy; one boss in the game proved that if you have a big enough gun, any form of cover is penetrable, from wooden boxes to stone pillars. You might sprint off a ledge and keep charging forward in midair, and during combat, enemies may shrug off explosions from grenades or red barrels, even if they detonate mere inches away.', 'Not only do the invisible walls impede exploration, but their often bizarre placement creates some frustrating moments during combat.', ""Every so often the game prompts you to pull out a notebook owned by great-grandfather Quatermain to solve one of its many puzzle rooms--a method that should sound familiar to fans of Uncharted. Don't expect to stress your brain solving these ancient enigmas. More often than not, the book demonstrates the steps you need to take--which lever to pull, which buttons to press in what order--to solve each mystery, turning what could have been a welcome break in the pace into a brief pause in the action while the game holds your hand through every step. If you are still having issues with a puzzle, no worries; your companions sometimes shout the solution for you, and continuously repeat it until you follow the command. There are several puzzles, however, for which the book offers no clear solution."", 'Solving these puzzles in particular requires an arbitrary solution. One has you placing a bundle of dynamite in a hook attached to a platform, which you then use to blow up a hanging engine block, which, amazingly, leaves the platform intact. Another has you deciphering a puzzle with your flashlight, which I solved by randomly waving my light around until it granted me access. These puzzles are thankfully rare, but they provide some of the more frustrating moments in the game.', ""At the very least, the puzzles allow you to take in Deadfall Adventures' attractive environments. Underground areas, from ancient catacombs to twisting mines, and the wild jungles of South America look astonishing. In the arctic tombs, for example, the orange of blazing pit fires complements the blue luminescent frozen walls and stalactites. Vine-choked, Mayan-inspired temples in Guatemala look appropriately aged. The style and design of these environments are an impressive foil to the blemishes and stand as the game's champion feature."", 'Mummies can be lured into one of the many instant-kill traps, further enhancing the importance of strategizing your moves.', ""Though Deadfall Adventures includes open terrain and large underground passages, it feels claustrophobic because it's plagued by invisible walls. For a game taking the guise of an adventure, it's sadly ironic that any sense of exploration is stagnated by these nagging restrictions. In Deadfall, you are funneled down linear paths where you can only proceed forward if you follow the developer's exact design. Short walls, stone formations, crates, and even some plants are little more than fancy dressing to hide irritating blockades. Not only do the invisible walls impede exploration, but their often bizarre placement creates some frustrating moments during combat. I remember fondly a time when I walked into a firefight and tried to quickly duck behind a box directly to my left. But no matter how hard I pushed the left key, I stayed in place, catching a few bullets in the process, all due to an invisible wall blocking me from taking cover."", ""If you're looking for more game time with Deadfall Adventures, it does include two different multiplayer modes. Standard multiplayer offers five different classes to play as, which allows you to jump in and play with your method of choice. You can build your own classes, and you don't need to hit a certain level to do so. Custom classes are available right from the start, but certain weapons will not come into your employ until you reach a necessary level."", ""More interesting is Survivor mode, which mimics the ever-popular Horde style of cooperative multiplayer. Here, you are rushed by the game's undead mummies, and since defeating them requires a flashlight, it takes more thought than simply lining up your iron sights and blasting away. This mode requires more tactics, and with a partner, you can find rhythm in the mayhem. In my play time, I used my flashlight to set the mummies alight, while my partner fired as soon as they were vulnerable. The game is set in rounds, and at the end of every rush, you get to replenish ammunition or grab a new weapon. Mummies can be lured into one of the many instant-kill traps, further enhancing the importance of strategizing your moves. Unfortunately, my time in the game's multiplayer was limited. As of this writing, I spent more time in the lobbies than in combat. The game's multiplayer is a ghost town, and the few players I met disappeared shortly after a round was finished."", 'Glitches, stereotypical characters, and dull combat betray any chance of Deadfall Adventures providing any real incentive for your troubles. Digging into this game yields not a rough-cut gem, but rather a lump of coal that should have stayed buried.']"Kevin VanOrd,18-Nov-13,LocoCycle Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/lococycle-review/1900-6415557/,6,Xbox One,"[""LocoCycle features a talking, battling motorcycle named Iris that drags a mechanic behind her by the pant leg. Iris' nemesis is a mean, gruff-talking motorbike that takes a moment to somehow munch on a giant hamburger in a roadside diner. Iris throws around Pablo, the mechanic, as if he's a battle-ready boomerang, all in the name of attending a festival she saw advertised in a biker magazine. Iris' Mecca is Scottsburg, Indiana. It's there where she belongs."", 'Who could have imagined that a game featuring so much ridiculousness could be boring?', 'Well, it\'s not all boring, though most of the fun comes not from the act of playing LocoCycle, but from watching it. Clever live-action cutscenes introduce you to Iris, Pablo, and a variety of other kooky characters, laying out the events that lead to a motorized battle machine dragging a Spanish-speaking mechanic down the open road. These wacky scenes had me laughing out loud frequently, especially during the first 30 minutes. Iris\' translation functions are fried early on, so she constantly misinterprets Pablo\'s cries to be set free as encouragement, and she lets loose hysterical one-liners proving her single-minded focus. ""Pablo, do you think in Scottsburg, Indiana, that the streets are paved with flags?"" she drones. ""I hear that freedom rides an eagle, which rides a motorcycle."" Elsewhere, the references fly fast and furious, with Iris dropping quotes from Top Gun, Back to the Future, and Allstate insurance commercials. (Though I wouldn\'t argue that Pablo is, in fact, in good hands.)', ""The giggles flow freely when the evil motorcycle called Spike picks up his own happy-go-lucky human companion. While Pablo routinely begs Iris for sweet release, Spike's jocular friend keeps a grin firmly plastered on her face. She happily sips iced tea as Spike pulls her down the open road, and the strange situations that duo finds itself in are great sources of chuckles. As for Iris and Pablo, Pablo's dialogue is all in Spanish, with subtitles splashed across the bottom of the screen, even during gameplay. At first I was annoyed that I had to keep taking my eyes off the action so I could read Pablo's dialogue. But in time, you realize that Pablo has absolutely nothing to add, and that you can safely overlook his repetitive pleas, just like Iris does. And truth be told, the game's biggest joke--having Iris pulling Pablo down highways and across rivers--is stretched thin by the time you reach the end after about two hours of play."", 'LocoCycle has no sense of when enough is enough.', 'Typically, you drive down the road as you might in a driving game, though there is no danger of crashing into guardrails and dying a fiery death; the game just nudges you back on track as an on-rails shooter does. You usually take down the vehicles and robots that hound you in one of two ways: either by shooting them from behind with your unspectacular guns or by mashing buttons in similarly unspectacular hand-to-hand combat. Or would that be bumper-to-bumper? In any case, the cartoonish cars and trucks that speed in front of you erupt in sparks as you fire at them, but the shooting sequences suffer from sameness and are kept separate from the melee sections. More importantly, there is absolutely no sense of danger, and thus no tension instilled. LocoCycle is the easiest game I have played in quite some time. There is little need to swerve around traffic, and there are no nail-biting shootouts between you and your enemies. The gameplay is a mechanism for delivering jokes, not for delivering interactive fun.', ""The close-quarters combat also suffers from a major dose of shallowness. At first, these sections prove to be a visual delight. Iris leaps into the air and pummels flying combatants in jetpacks with her tires and chassis, occasionally tossing poor Pablo around like a spinning top. (That's gotta hurt.) But once the craziness of the concept wears off, you're left with a simplistic combat system that only requires you to hammer on the same two buttons over and over, occasionally hitting another button to counter an attack. These battles are so easy that I don't think I missed an entire counter in the game, and I racked up enormous combo scores without breaking a sweat. The whole idea of combo scores in this game is silly, actually, given how aimless mashing makes you an instant LocoCycle expert. You earn points to unlock passive benefits, but I'd unlocked them all before I even hit the final stage, and none of them meaningfully deepened the gameplay. Its roads may be bumpy, but LocoCycle feels oddly flat from beginning to end."", 'LocoCycle does try to diversify, but most ideas wear out their welcome before the game moves to the next one. Side-view boss battles are fun diversions at first, but the bosses repeat the same few attacks over and over again, and possess so much health that it takes seemingly forever to bring them down. A top-down vertical shooting sequence is a nice change of pace for two waves, but it, too, fails to rise above the most basic ideas. By the time I hit the third wave, I was bored. By the time the fourth wave arrived, I was actively annoyed. LocoCycle has no sense of when enough is enough, and as a result, too many of these detours feel like padding as opposed to creative variations.', '""I hear that freedom rides an eagle, which rides a motorcycle.""', ""Luckily, LocoCycle comes into its own in its final 20 minutes. I don't want to give away too much of the final chapter, since you have to see it to believe it. Let's just say that LocoCycle takes on the guise of a pure rail shooter, filling the screen with explosions and big robots, and using live recorded footage in its background to keep you gawking. And even before that, the game finds its way to a faster tempo. The quick-time events are accompanied by crazy scenes that remind me of 2009's Ninja Blade in all their dramatic insanity. You dodge falling boulders and careening school buses, evade Spike's frightening chained wheels, skim under semi trucks, and hang perilously from speeding helicopters. There's also a joyous minigame that has Iris flinging Pablo forward like a saw blade and spinning through legions of oncoming agents riding hoverbikes and surfing missiles."", ""I loved seeing LocoCycle through to its zany finale, because I enjoyed the jokes and Iris' robotic line delivery, and because I loved seeing the characters get themselves into silly situations. This would have been a great short comic film. But LocoCycle is a game, and in an unexpected twist of fate, it makes the act of catching rockets, fighting soaring robots, and rushing through the rural fields outside of Scottsburg, Indiana, blander than they deserve to be.""]"Martin Gaston,18-Nov-13,Dead Rising 3 Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dead-rising-3-review/1900-6415558/,7,Xbox One,"['Welcome to the beautiful city of Los Perdidos!

You'll be able to hop in a car and traverse from one end of this city to the other in about five minutes, but the thrill is in the journey rather than the destination. And if you happen to be making the trek on a RollerHawg, a combination of a steamroller and motorcycle, that journey will cheerily mulch a couple of hundred zombies into paste."", 'The original Dead Rising took place in a shopping mall and contrasted its zombie outbreak with the everyday sights of clothes shops, food courts, and pharmacies. Its sequel ratcheted its lens of consumerism up to Fortune City, its gaudy casino complex freshly built upon the smouldering wreckage of Las Vegas. Dead Rising 3 now takes aim at an entire city, but the themes are the same as before, even though its colour palette is certainly duller. Everything in Los Perdidos is a shop, and you are here to consume.', 'Dead Rising 3 takes to the the west coast in an environment large enough to need splitting across the districts of Ingleton, Sunset Hills, South Almuda, and Central City. But Los Perdidos is built to be a playground rather than a world, and its shop windows are tantalisingly stuffed with countless opportunities to bludgeon, slice, and splatter the undead hordes roaming the streets in their thousands. Few games offer such breadth in their potential weaponry or number of potential targets, and dismembering the undead with hub caps, pogo sticks, and coat hangers still feels both novel and hugely entertaining.', ""The outlandish outfits and versatile weapons clash with Dead Rising 3's ceaselessly dangerous environment, with more and more undead pumped into the streets of Los Perdidos as the game's five-day narrative progresses."", ""It's all well and good attempting to take out a zombie with a handbag while wearing a summery dress and medieval helmet, but at Dead Rising 3's core the game takes the idea of combo weapons, introduced in its predecessor, and runs amok. New hero Nick Ramos is no longer constrained to stitching together his weapons of mass distraction at a wayward workbench, with the recipes for these 100-odd combinations found in blueprints scattered around the city."", ""This is the first of Dead Rising 3's many efforts to smooth some of the series' harsh edges, and is ultimately a positive change that further highlights Dead Rising 3's huge focus on crafting, giving players the freedom to build new weapons as soon as they become available. The game justifies this contextually by making Nick a mechanic, one who is ultimately looking to escape the Los Perdidos by cobbling together a plane, but his character arc and mysterious tattoo are largely ignored until the latter chapters of the game, with Capcom instead focusing on the arsenal and body count."", ""The opportunities for raucous carnage are immense, though many of the combo weapons return from Dead Rising 2, and there's a giddy pleasure obtained from running around in a comedy costume (vintage tennis get-up, anyone?) and playing around with your new toys. Grab the corresponding blueprint and then mix some chemicals with a lead pipe to get the Pukes O' Hazard, a vomit-inducing club. The chest beam, made by combining microwave and a motorcycle engine, shoots out thick, meaty blasts of energy that can atomise a nearby crowd, and Street Fighter fans will eagerly unite an engine with some boxing gloves and shoryuken into the nearest zombie with the rocket gloves. Or, if you fancy introducing an element of randomised chaos, there's always the sentry cat."", ""New to Dead Rising 3 are super combo weapons, themselves made from taping together two or more constructed weapons. The results are usually devastating. The Fire Reaper, for instance, first requires you to make a Grim Reaper (scythe and katana, very good at clearing at groups) and then further combine that with a gasoline tank. Vehicles, now central to navigating the bridges and tunnels which connect Los Perdidos' districts, can also be fused together. These homebrew constructions, such as the forklift-meets-fireworks display Forkwork, are able to withstand and deal more damage, and quickly prove to be as invaluable as a good electric crusher, defiler, boomer axe, or freedom bear."", ""The outlandish outfits and versatile weapons clash with Dead Rising 3's ceaselessly dangerous environment, with more and more undead pumped into the streets of Los Perdidos as the game's five-day narrative progresses. Nick's swings are sluggish and imprecise, his movement heavy, and his mix of light and heavy attacks is designed for hacking away at a pack of enemies rather than individuals, which is fine until you need to take on a straggler or boss. Fighting is more about crowd control than outright aggression, and evasion is usually the best option despite having an inventory stuffed with kooky items."", 'Weapons and vehicles degrade and eventually break, and the game is all too happy to dish out a fatal punishment to players who venture unprepared into the middle of a horde. Zombies line every corner, constantly swarm out of vents, and Dead Rising 3 is also very much the kind of game where the walking dead will also quite happily fall from the skies, or at least off the top of a nearby building.', ""I can still remember the route to Colombian Roastmasters in the first Dead Rising, and jumping off the edge of the coffee shop to land on the balcony with the katana. I couldn't tell you much at all about Los Perdidos."", ""While everything in Dead Rising ticks along to its own in-game clock, the game layers together its plot-advancing story missions with dozens of other tasks in which you have to save survivors scattered around Los Perdidos, or dispatch its seven psychotic humans, each based loosely around the seven sins. These include a crazed physician, someone aggressively tending to a Japanese garden, and a man so lazy he'd rather attempt to kill you with automated drones than lift a finger."", ""Survivors, meanwhile, set Nick another task that needs to be accomplished, which usually involves either fetching something, such as a pack of scattered tarot cards, or ferrying someone to a destination. One surprisingly affecting mission has you guide an elderly woman around the city while she tells of her bygone years, offering a rare glimpse of life in a dead city. The game also randomly encourages you to smash through swathes of zombies in order to clear paths for stranded survivors. While many of these missions lack the eccentricity and charm of previous games--there's nothing in Dead Rising 3 quite like carrying a hungover showgirl who was sleeping off a zombie outbreak--the main incentive behind these acts of benevolence remains the same: rack up huge amounts of Prestige Points, which levels up Nick and expands his abilities and moveset."", ""Some survivors eventually join your party, where they can be armed with the game's less flamboyant weapons to fight alongside you, or can be led back to one of the game's safe areas and stored for later deployment. Keeping survivors alive was a key part of the first two games, as leading them to safety was how objectives were completed, but Dead Rising 3 considers it more of an optional afterthought. Safe rooms, scattered around each of Los Perdidos' four districts, also contains recharging lockers that can spawn in any item or combo weapon you've previously used. This is a game far more focused on having you slaughtering the undead than continually scavenging for items, though it's not always a change for the better. Dead Rising 3's accessibility makes it easier to rack up the kills, but infinitely spawning weaponry ultimately robs the game of the deeper connection I forged with Willamette mall or Fortune City. I can still remember the route to Colombian Roastmasters in the first Dead Rising, and jumping off the edge of the coffee shop to land on the balcony with the katana. I couldn't tell you much at all about Los Perdidos."", ""Dead Rising 3 also siphons off the series' time restraints and limited saving opportunities into its Nightmare mode, which is optionally playable from the start. The game's Normal mode provides ample time to accomplish everything and allows you to save everywhere, making the game far more accessible in the process. While the series' use of time limits and save points has always been one of its most divisive qualities, Capcom's efforts to cater to those who both like and loathe the restrictions will help the game appeal to a wider group of players. Personally I find that Normal mode also robs the game some of its brutal edge, neutering the rising tension and pressure from overcoming its adversities that proved so satisfying when accomplished."", 'Ultimately this is a tongue-in-cheek game that has enough heart to be endearing.', ""While Dead Rising 3's shift in aesthetic and accessibility initially suggest a series looking to reinvent itself, the game quickly picks up from where Dead Rising 2: Case West finished off. By the end of Dead Rising 3 you'll have been reintroduced to many characters and unanswered narrative threads from previous games. The series' juvenility also survives the transition, and this is a scruffy game that lacks finesse in both its technical execution and overall direction, with the wayward tone of cutscenes and dialogue often combining with unimaginative mission design, and the tedium of another boring escort mission clashes dramatically with the variety on show in the weapon crafting. Some of the more boisterous dialogue and lingering shots on the female characters also feel awkward and unwanted, but ultimately this is a tongue-in-cheek game that has enough heart to be endearing."", ""It's also impossible to avoid the game's performance issues. Dead Rising 3's frame rate is extremely choppy, the pop-in eminently noticeable, and I encountered many other occasional bugs such as game audio cutting out, survivors getting stuck on scenery, and one enemy whose mohawk kept popping in and out of existence. Dead Rising 3's ability to fill its streets with hundreds of zombies at once is certainly impressive, but the game is a poor choice if you're looking to show off the graphical power of a brand new Xbox One. Still, you'll probably forget about all that the first time you jump and attack at the same time with a bladed weapon, slicing a zombie vertically in half, and then run around gleefully repeating the move for the next five minutes."", 'Dead Rising 3 also finds itself saddled with a suite of perfunctory Kinect features. Grabbed by a zombie? Shake the pad to free yourself. In a battle with a boss? Use voice commands to say things like ""that\'s kinky"" or ""you\'re crazy"" to distract them. Need to attract the attention of a zombie, despite it going completely against the grain of the game\'s mechanics? Shout at them! The most encouraging thing I can say about these features is that they work. Far more successful is the game\'s addition of co-op play, allowing a second player to seamlessly drop into the game and take the role of Nick\'s acquaintance Dick. With many of the game\'s vehicles working best when a second player is manning the weaponry, hoofing it around Los Perdidos as a duo can be a blast.', ""Despite a wonky presentation and obvious technical hiccups, Capcom has successfully made Dead Rising 3 a more welcoming experience than its harsh predecessors. It can be an inconsistent experience, but I choose to ignore the game's peculiarities and play Dead Rising 3 in the spirit that I believe it's intended: running around in shark outfit shooting zombies with deadly dildos fired from a leaf blower."", ' ']"Peter Brown,18-Nov-13,Crimson Dragon Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/crimson-dragon-review/1900-6415561/,5,Xbox One,"['Crimson Dragon is an on-rails shooter that revives the cherished Panzer Dragoon series under a new name, fitted with light RPG elements and a dash of asynchronous co-op. Unfortunately, these added systems dont make a meaningful impact on the game at large, and the genres focused action is perverted by wildly concocted paths that send you and the camera into a tizzy. This, coupled with unusually aggressive enemies, makes Crimson Dragon a frustrating experience. There are rare, fleeting moments of greatness near the end of the campaign, but you have to fight the urge to put the controller down if you hope to catch a glimpse of them.', ""Plot is not Crimson Dragon's strong suit either, but it suffices in so much as it provides an explanation for your ability and need to command dragons. Not long after the colonization of the planet Draco, the inception of the Crimsonscale virus wreaked havoc on the human population and enraged the indigenous wildlife. Some people, dubbed the Seekers, were immune to the Virus. As one of the lucky few, it's your job to fight back against the rising tide, and investigate the cause of the Crimsonscale outbreak."", ""All levels consist of phases that last from one to five minutes apiece. You ride on the back of dragons, fighting swarms of enemies, collecting items, and occasionally facing a boss or a strong group of variations on common enemies. For each phase that you complete, you're rewarded based on your performance with credits or items. Credits can be used for many purposes: acquiring new dragons, hiring AI-driven wingmen, undertaking missions, and purchasing extra-life-like revival jewels. Regardless of how many enemies you shoot down or items you collect, the most important thing is that you survive."", ""You can attempt to better your chances by recruiting other players' dragons from the game's leaderboard, but these wingmen never make much of an impact. Granted, this fluctuates slightly based on the availability of high-level dragons and your ability to afford their contract, but the difference between low- and high-level wingmen is hard to recognize in practice. Regardless of whos watching your back, you're still the primary target. The most any wingman ever brings to the table is a powerful but limited-use attack that hits every enemy and recharges your health. Its helpful, but theres no reason it couldnt have been a function of your dragon to begin with. At best, wingmen provide you with a last-ditch attack, but at worst, they instill a false sense of security."", 'Though the game tries to instill confidence by offering backup, Crimson Dragons enemies are ever relentless, even on the easiest difficulty setting. Standard enemies fire dozens of projectiles at once, forcing you to constantly barrel roll to avoid impact in the face of large swarms. In some levels, it feels like all you do is bash the shoulder buttons to barrel roll, and simultaneously hammer on the trigger to fit an attack or two in between rolls.', ""Ostensibly, your ability to shoot down enemies and minimize damage relies on elemental relationships, which you can alter prior to heading into battle. However, though you're given a readout of the balance of your abilities and enemies resistances prior to starting a mission, choosing the right dragon and assigning the proper abilities rarely makes a meaningful difference. Likewise, your dragons can evolve twice, but these are mostly cosmetic changes, with an ever-so-slight bump in base stats."", ""The imbalanced relationship between stat growth and difficulty is disappointing, but struggling to overcome these odds is nowhere near as frustrating as coping with Crimson Dragon's camera. When you're flying in a simple pattern, it's easy to settle in. The left analog steers your dragon, and the right controls your weapons' aim. Free-flying stages, which allow you to control the speed and trajectory of your dragon, turn the standard control scheme on its head by assigning the camera controls to the same stick as movement. It's confusing, not to mention ineffective in the midst of combat when you have to track fast-moving, hard-hitting enemies."", ' ', ""Granted, there are only a few free-flying stages in the game, but erratic paths in standard levels also prove to be problematic. Quite often, you're sent careening around corners, with an unreasonable amount of visual interference, while under fire, without enough time to react to threats. If you submit, you can simply take some damage and move on. If you attempt to kill everything and lose control, you're more likely to be unprepared when the camera finally rights itself."", ""Fight your way towards the end of the game, and you'll discover stages with greater visual appeal than the initial selection of barren landscapes, and more sound level design, but its too little too late. Crimson Dragon frustrates more than it entertains. Flying your dragon can feel good, but it's only when the game takes a rare breath and slows down that it feels right. The ability to raise dragons is mildly intriguing, but they take forever to evolve into slightly more effective warriors, making the process more of a distraction than a rewarding challenge. It doesn't take long to realize that for all its efforts to be something more, Crimson Dragon misses the mark. It's occasionally sloppy, usually frustrating, and ultimately disappointing.""]"Brett Todd,15-Nov-13,SimCity Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/simcity-review-a-real-mayor-s-perspective/1900-6415554/,4,PC,"[""As someone who does this game-reviewing gig alongside serving as a real-life mayor of a small town in Canada, I come at a game like SimCity from a different angle than most. Not that different, mind you. The multiplayer focus and always-on Internet demands of Maxis' latest city-builder are beyond irritating. And the cramped borders that force you into constantly demolishing and rejigging your bulging-at-the-seams mini metropolis are almost enough to drive me to adopt the pastimes of another Canadian mayor who has been making the rounds of late-night talk shows recently."", ""But what really bothers me is the missed opportunity. This fresh take on SimCity comes a full decade after SimCity 4, yet it still repeats most of the same old mistakes, doubles-down on the regional approach introduced in that game with an obnoxious multiplayer push, and destroys the zoning system through unnecessary simplification. While you're supposed to be the mayor of a city, you're actually more of a dictator at the reins of a city-state. There are no limits to your power when it comes to spending tax dollars. You can rezone neighborhoods at a whim. Whole blocks of supposedly privately owned apartment buildings and businesses can be demolished with two mouse clicks if you get a sudden urge to create a massive football stadium to suit a Jerry Jones-size ego."", ""Not that you would want to get too tied down to reality. Dealing with a council, staff, and senior levels of government involves a lot of process and red tape that wouldn't translate well into a game. Well, a game that anyone would want to play, at any rate. It's much easier and more enjoyable to click on a button to build and destroy than it is to shepherd real-life municipal legislation through public hearings, consultations with planning advisors, three readings of a bylaw, and so forth."", ""Yet the changes made to this new take on SimCity actually make the game tougher to enjoy, and knock back the realism even farther than it was a decade ago. Maxis continues with SimCity 4's regional approach, although there are significant differences. You still have the option of guiding more than one city on a regional map that can include up to 16 separate municipalities. But city size has been cut back by around 75 percent in comparison with SimCity 4. This forces you to branch out and take over the other cities in the neighborhood while playing alone or by playing online multiplayer, because you can never fit all of the facilities and businesses and homes that you need to survive and thrive within the borders of just one town."", 'This ""honey, I shrunk the city"" approach has been geared to hamstring you into playing the game how Maxis and Electronic Arts want it played--always online--with you filling all the roles and taking over every city in a region as a godlike hizzoner. Try building a self-sustaining city that is all things to all citizens, and you will soon bang your head against the wall so thoroughly that you might come out on the other side thinking about running for municipal office in the real world.', 'Even if you can somehow appreciate this regional approach, cities are just way too small on their own. You can build out to the limits within an hour or two of starting a city, and have no way of expanding beyond that besides taking over a neighboring town as the incredible multiple mayor or making nice with fellow human mayors in multiplayer. Once you hit the dotted-line wall (which has been made extraordinarily aggravating due to how maps have huge stretches of wilderness between cities that you can never touch), you have to start demolishing and rebuilding. You have to rework everything as your city grows, inventing ways to cram in Godzilla-size new municipal facilities like sewage plants and universities, expand neighborhoods to jam in more residents, and play with factories to create more jobs.', ""Get beyond these frustrating mechanics, and you don't feel like you're doing the work of a mayor, either. Municipalities function more like independent nations than cities, trading services and goods back and forth like members of the EU. Granted, this sort of thing happens with cities and towns in real life, but not generally for the reasons SimCity puts forth. I can't think of any cities that have contracted out police and medical services to other municipalities because they didn't have room for police precincts and hospitals within their own borders. My suspension of disbelief also takes a hit when it comes to natural resources, which are a national responsibility, not a civic one. Municipal governments looking after oil and ore is a bridge too far."", 'Try building a self-sustaining city that is all things to all citizens, and you will soon bang your head against the wall so thoroughly that you might come out on the other side thinking about running for municipal office in the real world.', ""Even when you do manage to team up with other human players or build a few sharing-is-caring cities on a map of your own, it all still seems pointless. Building cooperation seems great in principle, but I always find myself thinking that I could handle all that garbage myself, or put out all those fireworks fires without needing help from a sister city, if only the game would give me more room to grow. Push out the dotted lines that hamper city growth, and I'd never have to petition the Duckburg next door for any help. The interrelationship attributes come off as fake and forced."", 'Another major problem lies with zoning. At the center of your ""mayoral"" powers is the ability to zone areas for residential, commercial, and industrial development. You lay down roads, select the zoning tool, pick one of those three aforementioned categories, and draw a box around what you want to zone. Presto, you\'ve created a zoning bylaw for part of your city. As soon as you\'ve finished any sort of zoning, developers arrive and start building homes, stores, or industries on the block or blocks in question. If only it were this easy in the real world.', 'But even though this system might seem to be a fitting simplification of how municipal zoning really works, it actually makes SimCity more complicated, and is a huge step backward for the series. Back in 2003, SimCity 4 got zoning (mostly) right, with a low-, medium-, and high-density system very similar to how real municipalities function. Now you\'ve got ""build it and they will come"" zoning where you pick from one of the three main categories and then watch as buildings get denser and bigger all by themselves. Growth occurs naturally based solely on economic conditions, how wide you\'ve made the roads in the area, and how much land you\'ve set aside to let three-bedroom bungalows expand into 20-story condo towers and little assembly warehouses balloon into massive chemical factories.', ""The result of losing zoning control? Utter chaos. This problem is exacerbated by the ludicrously small territory that each city is jailed in, since there is no room for mistakes. You need to guess at both how big you want your blocks to be and how wide you want your roads in order to accommodate future growth. Go too small at first, and you soon wind up demolishing roads to give buildings room to expand. Go too big at first, to allow for eventual growth, and you soon wind up demolishing buildings to add roads allowing more space for homes, businesses, and industries. You can't win. You're either bulldozing blocks because you don't have enough room, or you're demolishing blocks because you've left too much room. Perhaps this is supposed to mirror the evolution of a city over time, but it plays out like you're making one mistake after another and correcting these errors by blowing up huge swathes of the city to start over and over again."", ""One other problem lingers from the game's horrendous launch early this year. You still have to connect online to play, and there are still regular periods when the servers cannot be accessed. I didn't play the game in the spring, when it went through long stretches of being unavailable, so I can't comment on whether or not this issue has gotten better. But during the course of playing the game for this review, it regularly refused to run because it could not connect with the servers. This generally lasted for no more than five- to 10-minute stretches, and was usually much shorter than that (although there was also one five- or six-hour outage). Still, these outages remain absolutely unacceptable, especially for a game that you should be able to play solo. The always-on Internet connection requirement needs to be removed so you can take your single-player city-building offline."", ""All that said, SimCity can hook you for lengthy stretches of time before the frustration of dealing with its flaws wears down your patience. The game excels in a number of areas. You couldn't ask for a more intuitive interface. A glance at the menu bar tells you immediately if you've got trouble brewing with the water supply, schools, police, electrical grid, and so on. The needs-and-wants heart of the gameplay is handled very well, too, so you're never left in the dark over such vital information as why businesses are failing or why citizens are loving your town. Click on any structure in the game, and you instantly get a rundown of what's good and bad in your city, from the perspective of the sims who live or work there."", 'Go too big at first, to allow for eventual growth, and you soon wind up demolishing buildings to add roads allowing more space for homes, businesses, and industries.', ""Visuals and sound are superb for the most part, though the graphics get oddly blurry at times when you're down near street level. Cities boast neat lived-in details that you can see when zooming in on your sim citizens, and the soundtrack includes a jazzy score and atmospheric effects that always tell you what you're looking at (though the developers could have chosen a less-disgusting glug noise for those moments when you're checking on sewage flow). All of this just accentuates the letdown in the end, though, because you're always aware of how much better this game could have been."", ""Whether you're a mayor or a wannabe or a constituent, SimCity is a big disappointment. As the first game in this classic series in a decade, it should have been something special that took the city-building concept in exciting new directions that let everyone see what it's like to serve as a mayor. Instead, the developers got tangled up with a multiplayer concept that is little more than an albatross hanging around the player's neck and never addressed the many, many ways that this look at a mayor's life could have been made both more realistic and more enjoyable.""]"Carolyn Petit,15-Nov-13,Need for Speed: Rivals Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/need-for-speed-rivals-review/1900-6415555/,8,PS4,"['""Damage critical."" The words appear on the screen in red, sending a rush through me. One more hit and I\'m done for. It\'s too far to the nearest repair shop; I know I need to make it back to a hideout fast or I\'ll lose everything. I gun it, relying on my reflexes to help me evade the police, with their spike strips and their reckless attempts to run me off the road. There are only two possible outcomes: the triumph of big risks taken and big rewards achieved, or the agony of seeing everything I\'ve earned slip away in an instant. Which will it be this time?', ""Despite being the work of new developer Ghost Games, Need for Speed: Rivals is clearly a game in the mold of Criterion's entries in the Need for Speed series, particularly 2010's excellent Hot Pursuit. In this game, as in that one, you step into the cars of both cops and racers and cruise around a gorgeous open world, completing events that require you to either evade the law or enforce it. Of course, enforcing the law here isn't a matter of asking drivers to politely pull over; instead, it involves ramming racers at speed, using spike strips and shock rams, and wrecking the elusive racers' vehicles by any means necessary. As a racer, you have plenty of tricks up your sleeve as well, including shock waves that damage and repel nearby vehicles, and jammers that prevent the cops or your fellow racers from using their own weapons against you."", ""This wild technology can get you out of a tight spot as a racer or help you incapacitate one as a cop, but it's your skills as a driver that matter most. Weaving through traffic and around roadblocks, drifting smoothly around turns, and making smart use of your limited nitrous can make all the difference, and dividing your attention between driving skillfully and making the most of your tech is wonderfully stimulating. With so much going on at once, it's not unusual to feel like you're operating on pure instinct, and when you get into that zone, Need for Speed: Rivals is aggressive arcade racing bliss. These cars feel hefty and substantial, so as you side-slam a cop or hit a racer from the rear, you can almost feel the clash of metal on metal in your bones."", ""Most of this could have been said about Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit too. And the event types that are scattered around the landscape are standard stuff: straightforward races, time trials, hot pursuits in which cops try to bust racers before they reach the finish line, and so on. But there are two things that reinvigorate this familiar gameplay in Rivals. One of those is that, by default, you always share the world with other players. Those players might be cops or they might be racers, and as you cruise around trying to complete objectives to advance your own career, your experiences and the experiences of these other players might collide. If you're playing as a racer, for instance, someone playing as a cop might start pursuing you, whether you're in the middle of an event or you're just cruising around."", ""And if you're a cop, hunting a human player across the winding roads of Redview County--an environment that offers no shortage of obstructions you can smash through and shortcuts that you can take advantage of--is more exhilarating than pursuing artificially intelligent prey. Other games in the series have had multiplayer options that pit cops against racers, but here, the multiplayer is seamlessly integrated into the world at large. You can encounter other players at any time, and as a result, the world feels alive in a way that earlier games in the series haven't. If you choose not to share a world with other players, AI cops and racers roam the roads, so there's still a chance you'll run right into a high-speed chase or some other action even when you're playing alone."", ""The seamlessness with which events are integrated into the world does carry with it the occasional downside. If you start a race, for instance, while being pursued by cops, the cops might crowd around you during the few seconds before the race starts, during which you're immobile. Once the race begins, you're hindered by the cluster of cop cars surrounding you, while your opponents speed off unhindered. Your opponents slow down significantly if you fall behind early, though, giving you a conspicuously artificial opportunity to catch up. And it's frustrating that, while you're being pursued as a racer, you can't use the GPS function to set a waypoint for the event of your choice."", ""The other element that makes Rivals particularly exciting is the irresistible risk-versus-reward mechanic you're constantly faced with as a racer. As you roam the roads, completing events and escaping the cops, you build up a score multiplier, and eventually, you're racking up the speed points you need to purchase new cars and upgrade existing ones really quickly. But your heat level also increases, meaning that the cops become increasingly aggressive in their efforts to hunt you down. It becomes extremely tempting to press your luck, to take one more risk, complete one more event, and reap the rewards. But if you're busted--which can happen anywhere at any time, until you make it back to a hideout--you lose all of the speed points you've accrued on that outing. It's deliciously excruciating to see all your points slip away, and narrowly escaping the law to make it back to a hideout with a fat stack of points makes you feel like the king of the road."", ""And what a beautiful road it is. There's nothing decidedly next-gen about the look of Rivals, but it's still a gorgeous game. Redview County is lush and inviting, with leaves blowing in the forest winds, waves crashing on the coast, and pleasure seekers hang-gliding in the clear blue skies. At least until the weather changes. At that point, a thunderstorm might lend an ominous atmosphere to a dangerous race along a cliffside. Whatever the forecast, the cars themselves, and the collisions they tend to get into, look spectacular, sending showers of metal and glass in all directions."", ""Need for Speed: Rivals is very much in the tradition of Hot Pursuit, but that great, familiar gameplay has been infused with enough new elements to make it as thrilling here as it's ever been. It sure is good to hit the open road again.""]"Tom Mc Shea,14-Nov-13,NBA 2K14 Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/nba-2k14-review/1900-6415551/,8,Xbox One & PS4,"[""Selfish athletes get a bad rap. Basketball is about more than winning and losing, more than raising banners. It's about All Star appearances and Hall of Fame busts. It's about pride. When I throw a beautiful pass to a wide-open big man under the basket and he misses a gimme, I don't care about the scoreboard. I'm worried about my stats, and how that buffoon just cost me a double double. And don't think for a second that I'm going to launch a full-court shot just before the buzzer sounds, not when I'm shooting 60 percent from the floor. NBA 2K14 puts you in the shoes of an NBA rookie, where you jockey for playing time and earn respect. My team's name may be on the front of my jersey, but it's the name on the back that's important to me."", ""NBA 2K14 has moved closer to reality than any basketball game so far. Players tweak their shots when defenders rush toward them, and tumble miserably to the floor when a driving point guard catches them off balance. Miss a critical foul shot, and you see the frustration in their eyes. Can they shake off their failure to hit the next shot? When Tyreke Evans is pounding the rock at the top of the key, his teammates stand around watching, knowing that even if they flash open, he's not going to give them the ball. The intelligence isn't so artificial anymore. Wing defenders fly toward the block to double-team Roy Hibbert, or stay glued to their man when Dwight Howard is bumbling around. The kinetic flow mirrors the real game so closely that minor flaws, such as when players don't dive for a loose ball, really stand out."", ""What's most striking about the visuals is how they draw you in. Stephen Curry isn't just a nondescript avatar. You can see his face and hear his words, and you want to prove your value against him. Thump your chest after picking his pocket; you've earned a bit of strutting. Make sure your feet are planted before you hoist a long three. If you're drifting backward, you jump awkwardly, and that off-balance hitch could be the difference between a swish and a clang. Defenders have busy hands, swatting away contested shots like a young Hakeem Olajuwon or poking at lazy dribbles like a venomous Chris Mullins. Again and again, defenders embarrass you, until you learn restraint. Use your off arm to shield the ball, practice up fakes and fadeaways, and most of all, be patient. Watch the flow before attacking, and know your limitations. This is a team game, even if you only care about filling up the box score."", ""And don't think for a second that I'm going to launch a full-court shot just before the buzzer sounds, not when I'm shooting 60 percent from the floor."", ""I've always felt a disconnect in previous iterations of My Career mode. Although I could use my own name and decide my play style, I never felt like I belonged. My player was just an avatar, as separate from me as a real NBA player. That's no longer true in NBA 2K14. Story sequences that played out behind the scenes made me care. Sure, I laughed when Derrick Favors would give me advice even though his voice wasn't recorded and his mouth didn't move, but I still appreciated being taken under his wing. After I shot poorly, he pushed me to the practice floor, and I couldn't leave until I knocked down 20 consecutive shots. After games, my coach called me into his office to praise me for an exemplary night on the court, or lecture me for sloppy play. I was part of the team, and chose how I conducted myself. When Richard Jefferson employed some Richie Incognito-style bullying tactics--telling me to carry his bags and wear a red nose just because I'm a rookie--I told the old man to shove it."", ""When the season began, I found my butt stapled to the pine. The Jazz aren't exactly loaded, but I still couldn't beat out Alec Burks or Brandon Rush for playing time. I watched players trade baskets from my courtside vantage, turning my head to see how my teammates were responding or peering into the crowd to watch the cheers and catcalls. Of course, I watched the action unfold as well, and took advantage when the coach finally gave me a chance. Coach Tyrone Corbin liked my willingness to act as a glue guy. I drained open threes and found cutting players. There were serious holes in my games, so I committed more rookie mistakes than I'd like to admit. I piled up more turnovers than points, unable to overcome pressing defenders, and couldn't defend a lick one-on-one. My feet were like cement, way too slow for the likes of James Harden. But I made slow and steady progress. When I became the team's sixth man, I couldn't contain my smile, and even led the team to a victory during a critical fourth quarter."", 'And then I tumbled.', ""When Richard Jefferson employed some Richie Incognito-style bullying tactics--telling me to carry his bags and wear a red nose just because I'm a rookie--I told the old man to shove it."", 'Coach Corbin began to trust me so much that he put me in charge of the second unit. As the main ball carrier, I had to run the offense, and that newfound responsibility was overwhelming. Defenders sensed my weaknesses, trapping me before I reached the three-point line. I was slow to react, panicked, and forced an ugly pass that resulted in a turnover. Later, I split a double-team and threw a pass to Enes Kanter. But I was out of control, and the ball sailed into the 10th row. Another turnover. On the defensive end, I wanted to make up for my mistakes, so I gambled for a steal. And I gave up an easy basket. That was the wake-up call I needed. When Austin Rivers is making me look foolish, I know that my game needs serious work. Coach Corbin chewed me out after the game, and cut my minutes, but I would earn my way back on the floor.', ""2K14 does a remarkable job of cutting the fat. You don't have to waste time scrimmaging or training in My Career mode; you prove your value during games. And that immediacy is empowering. The same is true in My GM mode. I tinkered with the stacked Pacers rosters before the season began and was proud of what I pulled off. I traded Danny Granger for Giannis Antetokounmpo and Ersan Ilyasova. I thought I was the next Jerry West. It turns out I was worse than Isiah Thomas. My beloved Pacers became the dregs of the East, but I continued to pitch trades to get back on top. With small success, I gained the wisdom that separates the general managers who are ousted in two years from those who flash maniacal victory grins at every draft. I learned how to scout and how to judge the emotional makeup of players. And don't think that irony was lost on me. I needed to know how mentally sound my players were, but couldn't become emotionally attached or else I'd be scared to pull the trigger on a trade."", ""Because NBA 2K14 is so close to reality, every step away from what we know about the real NBA feels off. Earning points to improve my scouting talent as a general manager is less rewarding than organically becoming more proficient. Why do I have to earn the ability to tweak lineups? I'm the general manager, darn it, and I can fire the coach if he questions me. The same contrivances exist when improving your player in My Career. My three-point shooting doesn't improve when I spend time in the gym or drain a clutch corner jumper. No, I have to spend points in that stat after the game. Yes, raising my character from benchwarmer to starter is empowering, but just imagine if I could improve based entirely on how I played. There's still that lingering disconnect, that one element that kept me from being fully invested. Even with this unrealistic approach, there's so much that lured me deeper in that I couldn't dwell long on this one oddity."", ""The on-court action in NBA 2K14 isn't markedly different from the way the current generation versions play, which means its excellent, and by far the best we've ever seen in virtual basketball. What's so remarkable is how the upgraded visuals enhance the overall experience. Smooth animations and lifelike faces aren't just eye candy; they affect you on an emotional level. By chipping away at that barrier between digital players and real life, you feel even closer to what's transpiring, which makes it difficult to pull yourself away. You want to hold the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy in one hand and an MVP trophy in the other. For the first time in my life, I finally sympathized with the likes of Carmelo Anthony.

The ground is alive with activity and contains both the peacefulness and apathy of Mother Nature.', ""Morphopolis introduces you to such a world, putting you in control of various insects over the course of five stages and having you mosey along stems and leaves, solving minor puzzles so that you may progress. Those puzzles are not the game's most pervasive element, however: most of the time, Morphopolis takes the form of a traditional hidden-object game. You lead your bug down the few possible paths, clicking on the eggs, flowers, and disembodied grasshopper legs hidden in the busy, detailed environments until you collect the prescribed number. In turn, you click on the insect or foliage associated with the collected goodies in order to initiate a simple brainteaser, which might involve parroting the sequence of lights signaled by a group of creepy-crawlies, or piecing together a moth-themed jigsaw puzzle."", ""Morphopolis' picturesque backdrops and soothing soundtrack are immediately inviting.

You click on hidden objects until you unlock a quick-and-easy puzzle, so that you can unlock the next group of objects to click on, so that you can unlock the next quick-and-easy puzzle. The only puzzle that I got hung up on wasn't due to its challenge, but due to its lack of visual feedback; because it wasn't clear that certain elements could be interacted with, and how to interact with them, I had to fiddle around until something happened. Otherwise, I breezed through the five levels relatively unimpeded in about 45 minutes, wishing that the game would uproot its structure and deliver new ideas."", 'It was almost as if I could feel the pollen and humidity fill my lungs with every breath.', ""Clicking on objects that seem organic to the world rather than ridiculously random objects cluttering the screen makes for a nice change among hidden-object games, but the items are so easy to find that I was never transfixed by the process. Eventually, I grew to see the puzzles, as well as my insects' dawdling speeds, as a hindrance to what I really wanted to experience: the joy of taking in a new set of gorgeous sights.

Blood of the Werewolf tells a story influenced by classic Hollywood monster flicks, depicting a mother's journey to recover her son--a journey paved with blood, despair, and a few nagging issues. This is a challenging 2D action platformer that shoots for the moon, and only barely makes it."", ""Blood of the Werewolf has murder on the brain. It's a game that offers few moments of tranquility, forcing you to hop, duck, climb, and dodge through 10 stages filled with whirling blades, blood-coated spikes, fireballs, deadly pitfalls, pools of bubbling lava or molten metal, and electrified water. These unsacred grounds are haunted by creatures of myth and nightmare, including merfolk, lava beasts, harpies, bats, necromancers, and more. These monsters either force you into combat or cause you to hesitate just long enough for the game to snatch away your life in one of its many nefarious traps."", ""If you haven't gathered by now, Blood of the Werewolf is hard. A miscalculated jump means a quick end to your adventure. The game exists in the same category populated by platformers like Super Meat Boy--a domain of scattered keys, broken controllers, and bitter tears. Luckily, the game is generous with its checkpoint system, and each revival replenishes your health and ability meters, regardless of their amount before death. If you nab a special ability but fail to make it to the next checkpoint, the game lets you keep it, so you don't need to navigate the same dangerous path that leads to it in the first place. Health items are also rewarded on occasion, in a move that you could interpret as the game offering you a shaky and short-lived truce."", 'Practice and patience are required to win against such classic villains as Dracula and the Mummy.', ""Blood of the Werewolf is themed after classic Hollywood films, complete with stages announced using a black-and-white movie-style marquee, and the lore brings history and weight to the game's narrative. It stars famous monsters banded together under Dr. Frankenstein as a coalition in order to achieve their dark desires. Selena and her family, the last of the known living werewolves, escape from Europe to America, where they hope to live in peace, away from the machinations of the doctor and his cohorts. Their efforts prove to be in vain."", ""Displeased at the family's flight, the monsters track them down, killing the husband, kidnapping the child, Nikolai, who they conclude is better off living with his immortal kin, and leaving Selena gravely wounded. Furious, Selena hunts down their betrayers, offering exposition during the breaks between stages. The monsters make up five of the game's boss battles. Practice and patience are required to win against such classic villains as Dracula and the Mummy. The bosses attack in patterns, and the key is to decipher the attacks, searching for a clear opening to launch a counterattack."", ""The game offers two interesting and completely different ways to play. Under the cover of roof and cave, the protagonist Selena uses well-timed platforming and a crossbow as her primary methods of self-preservation. But under the light of the silver moon, Selena transforms into a powerful werewolf, complete with different abilities. In beast form, Selena moves swiftly and is able to double jump and use her claws in a powerful melee attack. As a werewolf, prepare to do a lot of double jumping. Large gaps can be crossed only with the maneuver, and since you can perform the second jump any time after the first, the game often puts you in situations where one platform gives way, and the next can be far below and at a distance, accessible only by timing that air hop carefully. Special abilities gathered as a werewolf include a lunge move learned early, as well as increased melee damage, a healing spell, and an ability that sends out a wave of charged red energy. But Selena in human form isn't completely vulnerable. Her crossbow can be upgraded with special properties, such as firing split or burning arrows."", 'Collecting sigils scattered throughout levels goes toward your next health upgrade. Gold sigils count as one point towards an upgrade, while the rarer and harder-to-reach platinum sigils are good for 10. Most of the time, sigils are placed in positions where they can be picked up merely by running through them, or by jumping. But the game does like to tease. Some sigils are placed in precarious positions, goading you to take a leap of faith for the shiny prize. Other times, sigils are placed in a way that forces you to break your stride, and if you jump incorrectly, putting you only pixels behind where you should be, you risk giving the row of industrial smashers in chase a chance to catch up and grind you into lycanthrope chili.', ""Dodging traps would be easier if it weren't for the terribly clunky keyboard controls. To jump, you must press the up key. But to climb ladders, which are practically everywhere in the game, you have to hold shift and jump, which is as awkward as you can imagine. Trying to move up and down a ladder using this control scheme causes Selena to jerk in motion, sometimes even forcing her to leap off a ladder and into enemy fire, which otherwise would have been easy to avoid. But this isn't a silver bullet that buries the game."", ""The developer implores you to use a controller over the keyboard, and I wholeheartedly echo that sentiment. I went through half the game using the keyboard, and the change to a controller was like having a pitch-black night brighten from a full moon. Climbing ladders requires input only from the thumbstick, so dodging enemy fire is much easier. To drive this point home, in one stage I died a total of 37 times while using a keyboard. When I replayed that stage using a controller, I died only nine times. Granted, I was a little more skilled by that time, but this stage in particular was much easier to navigate with a gamepad, even against instant-kill traps. Playing Blood of the Werewolf with a keyboard is certainly possible, but I don't recommend it."", 'Clean pastel colors breathe life into the characters and the gorgeous environments.', ""With controller in hand, platforming in Blood of the Werewolf becomes its strong suit. Manipulating Selena takes little effort, though success still requires precise button presses and keen spatial awareness in order to dodge every deadly projectile and round-ending trap coming at you from all directions. Prepare to nervously wince your way through instant-kill spike walls, spinning saw blades, fireballs, and whatever else is flung at you from the game's horde of nasty monsters, ghosts, goblins, and the like."", ""The game is challenging, but that's where the attraction lies. With every death, that beautiful checkpoint light at the end of the tunnel grows ever broader. It's that faint promise of progress that invites you onward, convincing you that you will make it this time. Eventually, it's anger that drives you forward, seeking that satisfaction of seeing a spinning moon that signifies a checkpoint."", ""The platforming is a mostly pleasurable and effortless affair, but there are a few hiccups. On some occasions, always while in werewolf form, Selena slips off a small platform for no apparent reason. It's not due to any wind, which comes into play later in the game. Rather, she simply vibrates right off solid ground and into hungry blades below. This happened several times during my playthrough, but I wasn't able to re-create it. I concluded the anomaly to be purely random. Another issue that might not be as glaring to others as it was to me was the inconsistent hitbox surrounding Selena. Sometimes a flying axe or fireball somehow struck Selena, though it was clear that it missed. Barely missed, but still, the hit should not have occurred. Taking damage from a spike or projectile causes a knockback effect, sometimes knocking Selena into another projectile or damaging object, creating a chain of knockbacks and heavy damage. It wasn't an issue when I knew it was my error in judgment that caused Selena to get hit in the first place. But it frustrated me to watch Selena get knocked back and forth because of a projectile that had clearly missed."", ""Clean pastel colors breathe life into the characters and the gorgeous environments. Selena, as wolf or human, stands out cleanly against the backdrop of the blues, browns, and blacks of her nocturnal world. Audio is also vivid, featuring a catchy musical score and an energetic vocal cast, led by Erin Cummings as Selena, though I wish she'd stepped a few inches away from the mic during periods of impassioned monologue."", ""The game concludes on a disappointing note. After fighting past monsters and traps, and coming face-to-face with the game's big bad, Blood of the Werewolf emits more of a whimper than a howl. It's unfortunate, because after surviving hours of punishment, you would hope to be given the satisfaction of a triumphant finale. Nevertheless, Blood of the Werewolf is a fine platformer, offering plenty of hours of fun and occasional frustrated sobbing. Fans of classic Hollywood monster movies and platforming games rejoice: your game is here.""]"Martin Gaston,14-Nov-13,The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-legend-of-zelda-a-link-between-worlds-review/1900-6415543/,9,3DS,"[""It's not easy to return to a place after a 21-year absence, so it's a surprise how effortless it is to slip back into the Hyrule first introduced in 1992's The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. The famous green tunic, castle, and characters are all revived in this 3DS sequel, and the passing of two decades and three console generations has done nothing to dull the sharpness of Link's first triumphant swing of the Master Sword."", ""For those who have cherished the original over the years, the nostalgic opening moments of this loving sequel will rekindle your memories of the classic game that precedes it. The heart of A Link Between Worlds is buried firmly in the pre-3D age of the early '90s, and Nintendo has produced an almost note-for-note polygonal reproduction of the original game's Hylian overworld, complete with the triumphant boom of the series' main theme charging out of the 3DS's speakers. But while many elements of this sequel are familiar, this is a fantastic standalone adventure that excels on its own individual merits."", ""A Link Between Worlds is molded by the history it treats with reverence, but the game quickly creates an identity of its own. The fleeting cameo of Majora's mask, hanging on the wall of Link's house, is just one of the occasional nods from Nintendo acknowledging where the series has travelled since muddying its boots around the gardens of the original Hyrule Castle. Yet this game's accomplishment lies with Link's new ability to transform into a portrait and traverse walls. As a painting, Link is a stylised riff on a Romanesque mural beautifully animated to look simultaneously static and vibrant, with bouncy movement and flickering eyes. It's an impeccably charming effect."", ""The painting is the game's central mechanic, its version of a time-travelling ocarina, wind-summoning baton, or werewolf transformation, and many of the dungeons make good use of the new tool. The ability comes to him by way of Yuga, the game's main antagonist, who seeks to revive Ganondorf after the events of the original game by trapping descendants of A Link to the Past's seven sages as portraits. Link, as history has taught us, must rescue them. Many puzzles involve a two-dimensional Link wrapping himself around the walls of 3D environment to reach switches and chests nestled atop faraway platforms, slithering through thin cracks to enter new areas, or even traversing between two worlds by shimmying through the fissures that connect them."", ""It's not just a feature you'll use to get at the odd treasure chest, either, as Nintendo has done a fantastic job deeply intertwining every area of the game in ways that can only be accessed as a painting, as well as layering it as a required step in other puzzles. Many previous games in the series have had players use bombs start the timer on a frantic dash through a quickly-closing door, but here you'll be doing like that while instinctively jumping into the wall and shifting around to another platform. The fact that navigating the world as a painting becomes second nature is a huge accomplishment: it's so central to A Link Between Worlds that I couldn't possibly imagine the game without it."", 'The rest will be immediately familiar to those who know the Legend of Zelda series, largely because A Link Between Worlds treads the well-worn path of previous games. There is, as there always is, a comfort to this familiarity, although A Link Between Worlds feels like the most direct iteration the series has ever seen. Even the structure of the adventure is extremely similar to that of A Link to the Past, where a few hours thundering through three opening dungeons is rewarded with the Master Sword, before introducing the dark world alongside another batch of seven dungeons.', 'Nintendo has designed the first Zelda game where you feel free.', ""At the same time, though, you're encouraged to thoroughly and openly navigate Hyrule, a revelatory change which makes this adventure feel free of the series' previous restrictions. Puzzles in the overworld are no longer something you think to come back and tackle later, when you've unlocked your full suite of tools and weapons, but something you'll want to work out how to accomplish right then and there."", ""The game opens up further, too, when you reach the dark world, now known as Lorule. You can tackle the Lorule dungeons in any order you wish, which massively impacts how the bulk of this game plays out. Whereas many other Zelda games cordon off areas behind obstacles requiring items obtained in other dungeons, creating a set of talents and player options that slowly unfurl, A Link Between Worlds puts the game's arsenal in the hands of Ravio, a shopkeeper in a bunny suit who sets up his stall in Link's house. You simply rent the item you're after--be it hookshot, boomerang, or fire rod--and off you go. Maybe it's to your next dungeon, or that obstacle you saw a minute ago that you reckon you could thump out the way with your new hammer, or maybe you just haven't explored Misery Mire in a while. Nintendo has designed the first Zelda game where you feel free."", ""The shift towards renting items makes the game far more reliant on accumulating currency than before, with wayward pots, tall grass, and treasure chests in dungeons regularly forking out hundreds of rupees. It's a beautifully cyclical system, with item renting taking away the barriers of exploring the world and getting rich finding secrets, but also taking the money found in those hard-to-reach treasure chests and hidden rooms. Rented items, which generally cost 50 rupees, are lost if Link dies, but can eventually be bought outright for closer to 1,000 rupees. There are enough rupees scattered around the game for fastidious players to buy everything, but I found myself only purchasing my favourite items (bombs, arrows, and the hookshot) and simply renting the rest."", ""Ravio's shop also exists to serve the puzzles of the game's main dungeons, with each particular item getting its own dedicated moment to shine in some of the finest dungeons to ever feature in the series. The sand rod, for instance, lets Link cross gaps in the Desert Palace by conjuring up rows of cross-crossing pillars that inadvertently trigger as many problems as they fix, springing up at the wrong height or heading in the wrong direction, forcing you to leap into walls in order to figure out the correct path."", ""But, of course, there's no set path or order. You could just as easily take the hookshot to the Swamp Palace, and clip onto sets of valves that raise and lower the levels across sets of rooms in interconnected waterways, or use the lamp in the Dark Palace for a string of puzzles that need the lights to be on or off, with a couple that seem to be asking for both simultaneously, at least until you work out what's going on. These are tight, compact dungeons that are densely populated, and one of my favourite things about A Link Between Worlds is that it's the first game in a long line of modern Zelda titles that has routinely left me stumped in the middle of a dungeon, scratching my head, aimlessly running around in circles trying to figure out what I'm missing."", 'Though it can be bizarre to think that something so occasionally familiar can still be so fresh and engaging, A Link Between Worlds is itself a unique experience.', ""It probably sounds odd that this is a game at its best when it feels like you're untangling a skein of yarn, but much of the series' joy comes from having a tightly-woven series of locked doors and blocked corridors slowly and surely peeling away until you feel like you've become the master of this tiny domain. While this is a more perplexing game than many of its modern counterparts--especially if you're looking to rummage through all of its treasure chests--there are Play Coin-guzzling Hint Ghosts that will put you on the right path if they so desire. I'd advise against cheating yourself the joy of figuring it out, though; the challenge here is perplexing instead of frustrating, and it's worth enduring those occasional bouts of confusion for the satisfaction that comes from your eventual success."", ""This is a lengthy game, and getting stuck in its intricacies is a delight. Without a 3D world to explore, and the difficulties of targeting and locking on that come with it, A Link Between Worlds is pure top-down puzzle-solving in fast, fluid areas. Combat is quick and punchy, and many of the boss fights are tricky enough to elicit the kind of fear and tension (especially when you start worrying about losing your rented items) that's been absent from the series for a long time. Each dungeon builds to this confrontation, which comes as a thrilling, thumping, all-action crescendo after all the careful and thoughtful exploration."", ""Many of these boss encounters are riffs on adversaries originally encountered in A Link to the Past, albeit with a new spin on how they need to be defeated. And what fights they are: you challenge a monster guarded by a thick shield of ice, battle against a spinning whirligig that threatens to push you down a chasm, and take on a gaggle of eyeballs, a raging giant fist, a skeleton thief, or a monster with a noggin encrusted with a thick rupee shell. Each has their own particular weakness that needs to be exploited, with my personal favourite involving confusing one boss by running up to its shield and switching to Link's portrait form."", ""In many other areas, A Link Between Worlds' main refinements over its predecessor come from smoothing out the experience. You can fly to fixed points around both Hyrule and Lorule with the aid of a Witch's broomstick, the Fortune Teller near Kakariko Village now gives you direct advice rather than cryptic suggestions, and the map (displayed on the bottom screen of the 3DS) can be easily navigated, zoomed in, and annotated with pins. These features make exploration easy--you can head off the beaten path in an effort to reach that tantalising treasure on the horizon, because you know you can just warp back when you're done--and allows you to focus on the exact areas, or dungeons, you want to be pursuing. Coupled this with the game's loose structure and you're left with the most open Zelda game in the series."", ""The aesthetic, however, does not effortlessly transition to a polygonal world. Link looks closer to Bilbo Baggins than he does Legolas, albeit with blonde hair rather than the purple rinse of the SNES original, and the game's versions of trees look more like giant bulbous pumpkins. It's more of a functional visual upgrade rather than an artistic one, though the end result is pleasant enough."", ""One visual area that Nintendo does excel at, however, is the game's 3D effect, which adds a surprising amount of depth and character to the game, and is easily the most successful inclusion of the handheld's 3D slider since Super Mario 3D Land. I'm not normally one for 3D, but I wouldn't play A Link Between Worlds any other way. It's a fast-paced adventure, then, and one that feels like Nintendo paring back the layers of complexity the series has added in recent years and simply returning to the basics--this is worlds apart from the train track metagame of Spirit Tracks, the last dedicated handheld Zelda. Though it can be bizarre to think that something so occasionally familiar can still be so fresh and engaging, A Link Between Worlds is itself a unique experience. There's a lingering sense that by this point Nintendo is just running victory laps around a set of mechanics they perfected decades ago but, at the end of the day, none of that matters: this is simply an absolute treat to play.""]"Tom Mc Shea,13-Nov-13,Knack Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/knack-review/1900-6415530/,4,PS4,"[""Mercy is not part of Knack's vocabulary. He happily uppercuts a defeated enemy into a steaming lake of molten lava and flings an aircraft by its tail into the unforgiving ground. And don't believe for a second that he sheds a single tear for the pilot engulfed in the flaming wreckage; Knack doesn't let sentimentality distract him from a good fight. The only thing he desires more than brutal destruction is finding creative ways to exterminate his many foes. At least that's how the cutscenes play out. When you're given control, Knack mindlessly punches his way through corridor after corridor of enemies, and you're left wondering why Knack gets to have so much more fun than you do."", ""Oppression is the theme that binds Knack's overarching narrative together. Goblins have been forced from their lands by the imperialistic humans, and after surviving in the wastelands for generations, they finally have the power to mount a rebellion. Goblins aren't the only creatures who have to deal with oppression. Knack was created by a benevolent doctor who has found a way to turn ancient relics into a sentient being. The philosophical implications of this discovery flip the very notion of life on its head. As Knack muses about the nature of love during a quiet cutscene, you realize that, like Frankenstein's monster, he is capable of self-reflection and poignant observations. And yet, he is treated like a weapon. Does he deserve to be viewed as an equal even though he was birthed through alchemical experimentation? Such ruminations are glossed over. Instead of realizing his humanity, Knack usually acts like a meathead, cracking his knuckles while he waits for his next fight."", 'Instead of realizing his humanity, Knack usually acts like a meathead, cracking his knuckles while he waits for his next fight.', ""Relying exclusively on combat isn't inherently bad. There are plenty of games that slowly build on their fighting mechanics and provide enough twists and detours to keep you riveted. However, Knack's combat lacks the necessary depth to captivate your senses. The core problems stem from your meager repertoire. Knack has only five ways to attack the many enemies who confront him, and you learn every one of these moves in the opening tutorial. Three of these attacks--a whirlwind, a projectile blast, and a shock wave--serve as special powers that can be activated only when you collect enough sunstones. Another, your jump attack, propels you toward your enemy as a wrecking ball. But because both you and your enemy recoil when contact is made, you can't use this as the setup for your combos. Which leaves you with the standard punch. So you punch, and punch, and punch some more, for that is how victory is achieved in Knack."", ""There is weight behind your attacks that makes you understand the pain you're causing, and slow-motion finishers hammer home just how strong Knack is. But solid mechanics mean nothing alone. Because there is such little variance between fights, you're quickly lulled into the bored stupor of predictability. Knack absorbs relics into his body, which allows him to grow from a pint-size pet into a hulking monstrosity. Remember when a mere goblin took three hits to kill? Well laugh at those miniscule fools as you plow through them without breaking a sweat. Behold Knack, destroyer of goblins, devourer of worlds! Sounds pretty amazing, no? No is right. As you get bigger, so too do your enemies, so there's no difference in how fights play out. You still just punch your way to success and perform the weakest double jump known to games, only now you're fighting tanks instead of men."", 'During a moment of enlightenment, Knack realizes that his ever-changing body can be composed of more diverse parts than just relics. Ice, wood, and other materials automatically get pulled into the vacuum of your body in certain levels, shifting your appearance from runic golem to elemental beast. But said changes are only skin deep. Sure, a flaming arrow may melt your icy heart, so you can lose your outer shell that serves as a shield, but there\'s no mechanical difference between normal Knack and his earthy counterpart. Still, Knack does occassionally introduce ideas that hint at a real evolution. For instance, in some levels, you have a crystalline body, which initializes Stealth Knack. It\'s finally time for some real variety, right? Not quite. With the tap of a button, Knack can walk through the laser beams that serve as a high-tech security system. But enemies can still see you, even though you\'re invisible. It\'s hard to stifle a laugh when the doctor says, ""No more sneaking around"" after an enemy shoots at you, as if sneaking was ever an option.', 'So you punch, and punch, and punch some more, for that is how victory is achieved in Knack.', ""There are 13 chapters in Knack, and every one of them plays out in the same tired manner. You start out small, gradually build your size until you're huge, and then arbitrarily shrink back down when the chapter wraps up. There's always a convenient excuse for this transformation. How else could Knack fit in a biplane if he doesn't lose his precious relics? And then you start the whole cycle all over again. In the beginning of the eighth chapter, the doctor plainly states that you must grow as large as possible, as if we somehow missed the pattern that has been cemented from the onset."", ""If you're craving exploration, there are opportunities to veer slightly off the main path if you have sharp eyes. Weak walls can be knocked down to find extra relics and sunstones, along with collectible treasures that imbue Knack with new abilities. There are tons of collectibles strewn throughout Knack's expansive worlds, but these pieces are worthless on their own. If you're lucky enough to complete a set, you get a perk that gives you a passive ability. It wasn't until I reached the ninth chapter that I completed my first gadget, more than eight hours into my adventure. And what did I receive after all that effort? Enemies released a small amount of sunstone power when defeated. Don't expect these collectibles to inject the diversity Knack so desperately needs."", 'It\'s hard to stifle a laugh when the doctor says, ""No more sneaking around"" after an enemy shoots at you, as if sneaking was ever an option.', ""The most baffling part of Knack is its surprisingly high difficulty. Considering the cartoony artistic design and simple mechanics, you might assume that this game would be a cakewalk. But after you die a half-dozen times in the tutorial, that belief will be banished from your mind. When Knack is in his smallest form, he dies from just one or two attacks, and can stand only a couple more when he's bigger. So death comes frequently. If you're vigilant, you can avoid enemy advances by performing well-timed rolls, but even these should be used with caution. You're not invincible when rolling, so you can't abuse this maneuver. Now I love a good challenge, but dying is an annoyance in Knack because the combat sequences aren't interesting enough to play through once, let alone multiple times. There is a cooperative mode if you need a helping hand or want to offer one. Knack is as vulnerable as ever, but the second player controls Robo Knack who respawns after dying. Sadly, the action isn't any more fun when you're dragging a friend along for the ride."", ""Knack's downfall is that it focuses entirely on combat, but doesn't offer enough variety or depth within its system to compel you onward. Any early thoughts you may have that there must be more to the punch-punch-repeat action than meets the eye are banished once you plow through hours of the same basic sequences. And even Knack's few attempts at diversity are merely competent. The occasional platforming scenario lacks the joy of movement so necessary for jumping to be engaging, and the platform placement doesn't require any cleverness to surpass. There's not one element of Knack to rally around, to excite you.

But it's in the user-made levels that I now understand how much can be communicated through these simple tools."", 'Melancholia stands out from other stages in the greatest hits library of user-created stages. A crying child serves as the thumbnail, and there\'s a puddle of blood near his feet. The first section is ominous, making my breath catch in my throat. Half of the screen is filled with a red, pulsing gravestone. Etched on the face of it are the words ""In Memory of My Beloved Son, Tom, 2009-2012"" and ""My Dear Wife, Liz, 1980-2012."" Tombs dot the rest of your view, with white crosses marking each burial plot. Tom passed away when he was only 3 years old, and Liz was only a year older than me. How utterly heartbreaking. As you move onward, you learn the horrible events that have defined the last year for user jool2306: a lonely hospital room, a woman perched on a rooftop, and the depressing thoughts that must swirl in the mind of anyone who has suffered such losses. Was it possible that Sound Shapes provided an outlet for a grieving father and husband?', 'Revisiting Sound Shapes gave me a chance to see how the user-created library has grown, and it has cemented this game as something truly exceptional.', 'Community-made levels encompass a vast array of emotions, and many stand proud next to the developer levels. In A Walk in the Park, I rolled past snapshots of the quiet moments that I too often take for granted. A mother duck and her duckling ignore those around them as the mother passes on the secrets to survival to her hungry kin. In another scene, someone happily flies a kite, content to be alone in nature doing an activity that he loves. A couple walks hand in hand, off the beaten path into the trees where serenity thrives. In another level, Bastion, two robots wait for you to move, and they fire crisscrossing lasers if you try to sneak by them. These are just three of many incredible stages I discovered, and the range of emotions they deliver and the quality of the construction were impressive. So many games have amazing creation tools that are interesting to use but rarely result in anything worthwhile to play, but in Sound Shapes, you experience excitement or grief or any other of a wide range of emotions that makes you eager to see what else is out there.', ""Sound Shapes is a remarkable convergence of music and platforming. Because I've played through the main albums so many times, the levels didn't hit me as powerfully as they once did. But the community levels hammered home just how singular and enthralling this game is. There is so much personality infused in these stages that I felt as if I understood the people who designed them, at least a little. And that's what great tools, and a great community, can do. Sound Shapes is a transcendent experience in so many ways. Maybe its most important contribution is giving a voice to the world through music and action.""]"Kevin VanOrd,13-Nov-13,Killzone: Shadow Fall Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/killzone-shadow-fall-review/1900-6415536/,7,PS4,"['The Killzone series has often been lauded for its technological merits, but its artistic merits go too often unheralded. To define these games through terms like ""IBL sampling"" and ""particle vertices"" diminishes their striking beauty. Like its predecessors, Killzone: Shadow Fall is likely to be described through a technical lens, and the game certainly deserves praise for how many polygons it packs into its most expansive landscapes. Its buttery-smooth performance is also bound to earn kudos: Shadow Fall smooths away the frame rate hitches and texture pop-in we\'ve become so accustomed to in even the most visually impressive console shooters.', ""More wonderful, however, is the art the software's ones and zeroes convey. Shadow Fall brings the ongoing conflict between the series' warring races to planet Vekta, which provides a stark contrast to the hazy Helghan environs we explored in the previous two games. Vekta's gleaming blue seas and futuristic cityscapes have supplanted Helghan's reddened skies and intimidating dust storms. Where the Helghast were at the mercy of their harsh climate, the Vektans have made peace with nature. Their capital city may reach into the clouds and spread across the terrain, but birds still fly freely between skyscrapers, and massive mountains provide a sweeping backdrop."", ""This is a beautiful setting for a first-person shooter, and a fine showcase for the visual possibilities new consoles introduce. At first you might think that Shadow Fall doesn't represent a giant graphical leap forward, but it isn't displaying the typical shooter's limited spaces. You traverse a fair share of corridors, but you also float through the vastness of space and engage Helghast soldiers on stretches of rocky, open land. Shadow Fall's levels more closely resemble Crysis 2 and Crysis 3's areas than any prior Killzone game's, yet the game displays such expanses with more clarity than Killzone 3 displayed its tighter zones."", ""It's too bad that where Killzone 3 packed its maps with exciting action sequences, Shadow Fall's campaign forgot to bring the thrills."", 'Killzone: Shadow Fall uses its downtime to remind you of how pretty it is, but not in service of any particular narrative effect.', ""The basics are perfectly sound, at least. Shadow Fall's sense of weight doesn't match Killzone 2's, but its shooting and movement are exceptionally fluid. Each gun is enjoyable to shoot--the shotgun in particular, which blasts enemies backwards with satisfying oomph. Shadow Fall also makes a go at diversification. Zero-G sequences have you floating towards airlocks and you avoid the watchful eyes of patrolling Helghast in a stealth mission. You move from firing at soldiers while avoiding high-speed commuter trains to hacking spider drones and initiating their self-destruct sequence. The visual variety is commendable. The rain pelts metal walkways during a nighttime sojourn through an industrial installation, in contrast to the sunlit cliffs that play home to your early shootouts."", ""The problem is that none of these activities are particularly interesting. Helghast soldiers roam the larger areas, but they are too few in number, and don't offer much challenge. There are precious few large-scale shootouts; instead, you typically face a small handful of foes who take your bullets and collapse into a heap of ragdoll limbs without too much trouble. More troublesome is how much time you spend doing relatively little but moving through the game's admittedly gorgeous spaces."", ""Granted, many shooters take time to breathe between shootouts, building their worlds and developing their characters by way of slower-paced exploration and dramatic cutscenes. Killzone: Shadow Fall uses its downtime to remind you of how pretty it is, but not in service of any particular narrative effect. In one of several weightless sequences, you accompany a sluggish space capsule as it meanders towards its destination, blasting the buzzing drones that appear like clockwork and hinder your progress. The sequence wears out its welcome long before you arrive at the airlock. It doesn't build tension, deepen your understanding of the conflict, or stimulate you with great action. It's simply boring--one more insubstantial graphical set piece. Elsewhere, you join a checkpoint queue that recalls Half-Life 2's opening, but where Valve's masterpiece used overheard dialogue and televised broadcasts to introduce you to the oppressive City 17, this noninteractive wait provides few thematic details you don't already know, making its length seem unnecessary and self-indulgent."", ""Shadow Fall announces its potential in later levels, where you shoot explosive canisters and joyfully ride the resulting billows of energy to higher ground. In this tense chapter, you must consider positioning and cover opportunities lest a colossal security contraption liquidate your physical assets. When facing the nameless Helghast grunts, it was the battles against shielded troopers that I most enjoyed. These meanies give you a reason to make use of the little flying gadget that accompanies you on your journey. Typically, I used it as an offensive distraction, commanding it to draw enemies' attention by firing at them, which allowed me time to execute them with a deadly blast from my rifle, or with a mighty knife stab. Your attack drone is most handy because it weakens and stuns shielded enemies, giving you a chance to strike them down as they stumble."", ""Guerrilla Games remembered what drew me and many others to the front lines of online war, and it's here that Shadow Fall emerges from the rubble and flies into the electric skies."", ""The drone also serves as a rappel device, allowing you to slide to lower levels, though the game makes little use of this mechanic, and it's surprisingly easy to plummet to your death if you don't carefully select where to attach the hook. I rarely used the drone's shielding capabilities given how easy Shadow Fall is on its default difficulty level, and in fact, I was surprised once I'd finished to see how many full chapters I completed without once succumbing to death. The exception to this rule was a chapter that has you zigzagging between collapsing superstructures in a frustrating freefall sequence that prizes its action-film theatrics over proper playability. It's difficult to admire wanton destruction when the rules aren't well established."", ""One element of Killzone: Shadow Fall that's clearly superior to its predecessors is its story, which explores an aspect of the Vektan-versus-Helghast conflict that had gone curiously underscrutinized. The red-eyed Helghast are hardly moral lighthouses, but the Interplanetary Strategic Alliance's righteousness has never been called into question. Now, as Shadow Marshal Lucas Kellan, you face the atrocities your own faction has committed. The surviving Helghast have been offered a new home on Vekta, where the two races are physically separated by a security wall and engage in an uneasy cold war. Lucas's initial loyalties are established in the opening chapter, which gives Shadow Fall an intimate touch Killzone has always lacked, and Kellan ultimately finds himself torn between his fiery father figure and the mandates of his own conscience. The story beats a predictable drum, and Lucas is an underdeveloped hero who is only remarkable for what he does as opposed to who he is, but at no point did I look back longingly on Rico and Garza's meathead chatter."", ""Where Shadow Fall's campaign eases back on the action, its class-based multiplayer options front-load the thrills, and as always, the Warzone is at the center."", ""Warzone isn't a mode so much as a template. It allows you to mix and match various modes such as Team Deathmatch, Capture and Hold, and many others. Classic Warzone randomizes these modes and is an instant thrill. Guerrilla Games is a master of map design, and Killzone: Shadow Fall maintains the series' high bar. The Remains map recalls Killzone 2's finest online moments. Crumbling buildings and massive blast holes disrupt your line of sight and keep you looking up and down as well as all around, listening for the telltale footsteps and rat-a-tat-tats that betray nearby soldiers. Combatants weave through corridors and converge in the courtyards and open streets that shape the most frenzied battles."", 'Penthouse is another treasure among the 10 maps, featuring a rotating core that causes its four entryways to open and close, bringing an extra tactical concern to the firefight. An attempt to be clever and wait for one entrance to become accessible could end with a knife in your back when the entrance behind you clears instead. Players taking alternate routes are guaranteed to clash as they circle the surrounding hallways, and the victor in a surprise one-on-one encounter is typically the one who hits the trigger--or who pulls out a knife--first.', 'Cloaked teams slinked through a forest armed only with sniper rifles, desperate to stay alive.', ""On these maps and others, varying objectives pull you into action hotspots, where a dozen or more combatants vie for control. A well-placed spawn generator (which allows teammates to spawn outside of your base) can turn a calm theater into an unstable battlezone where a sudden glut of Helghast soldiers descend upon a group of defending Vektan security agents. The rotating modes keep you on your toes, but it isn't just the mad dash to the next capture point that lights my fire. After one leg of the battle ends, there's a restless pause while teams await instructions, giving me a chance to gun down unfocused fighters who let down their guard."", ""Shadow Fall features three classes--scout, assault, and support--in contrast to Killzone 3's five, though classes possess more than just two special abilities. While I dabbled as a scout, I'm not one to snipe from the shadows or cloak myself from view. I gravitated to the support class, in part because I love the shotgun's potency, but also because I enjoyed earning points each time a teammate used a spawn beacon I'd placed. I also enjoyed coming to the rescue of fallen comrades in need of revival, in part because I could summon a healing drone to the battlefield. What a nice change from using a defibrillator to shock a friend back to life."", ""Warzones let you arrange match types as you see fit, but you aren't limited to the default versions. You can customize matches in significant ways, and if you're worried about how well they'll play out online, you can always populate the match with bots. (The scarcity of bot support in other online shooters continues to exasperate me.) You can mess with the number of capture beacons, change time limits, and limit players to specific classes and weapons. Or try creating asymmetrical teams, forcing one to use pistols and allowing the opposing team to cloak themselves. You can significantly alter the pace of a multiplayer match by altering the parameters. I'm excited to see what anarchy results in a match with everyone armed with electrical squad cannons and carrying maximum ammo, and the personalized warzones I did play were notably different from each other. In one creation, cloaked teams slinked through a forest armed only with sniper rifles, desperate to stay alive, knowing that this match type didn't support respawning. In another match type, pump-action shotguns ruled the day. Each player possessed a special ability that allowed for hurried sprinting, turning a Capture and Hold match into a bloody close-range tug of war."", ""As much as I enjoyed my online time with Killzone: Shadow Fall--and as much as I will enjoy lots more time with it, unlocking perks that allow me to personalize my weapons--I missed Killzone 3's jump pack, which brought a nifty nimbleness to the battlegrounds. I missed it in Shadow Fall's disappointing single-player campaign, too, which sorely needed a shot of adrenaline. Where I look back fondly on Killzone 2's finest single-player moments, the moments I recall here are those in which I wandered through corridors and rocky meadows wondering where the bad guys were. Luckily, Guerrilla Games remembered what drew me and many others to the front lines of online war, and it's here that Shadow Fall emerges from the rubble and flies into the electric skies.""]"Kevin VanOrd,13-Nov-13,flower Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/flower-review/1900-6415537/,8,PS4,"[' ', ""I've heard that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but I cannot conceive of the beholder that wouldn't appreciate the beauty of Flower. Apart from its merits as a game, Flower is breathtaking, perching you atop a flowing breeze so that you may spread the vibrant colors of nature across the land. On the PlayStation 4, Flower is as lovely as ever thanks to a higher resolution, which allows the vividness to shine. Yet Flower's significance is tied not just to its visual elegance, but also to its use of music and motion to carry you across pastoral lands on a powerful emotional arc."", ""In Flower, you ride the wind. You enter the first level to see a single hovering flower petal; you press a button to surge forward and carry the petal with you, and tilt the controller to steer, as if you're the pilot of a blissful breeze. As you rush through the grass and natural growth, you pass through clusters of flowers, each bud blooming and adding a petal to the ever-growing bouquet that sails through the air. Each time you glide through a batch of flowers, petals emit notes that complement the bucolic soundtrack. In this way, you aren't just a player but a musical collaborator, composing your own countermelody as you rush ahead. Flowers are arranged in rows, circles, and other patterns, and following those patterns enhances the musical effect by allowing each tone to flow into the next."", ' ', ""This is the kind of experience some dismiss for not being a game, much as they might dismiss Journey, Gone Home, or Proteus. There is no score to achieve and no time limit obstructing progress. While there are levels that allow you some destructive powers and require you to maneuver with some care, there is no combat and no death. Reaching the end of each level is your ultimate goal, but the dividend is not place on a leaderboard; rather, your gift is the joy of watching gentle foliage radiate across the land after collecting the prescribed petals. Playing Flower is its own reward, following its narrative journey from easy existence, to conflict, to harmonious resolution. Developer thatgamecompany carefully crafted Flower's tempo so that its lowest emotional point would be followed by an enormous sense of uplift."", 'Like a snowy mountain ridge or a tranquil river valley, Flower invites introspection and inner calm.', ""You could reduce the journey's message to a simple environmentalist one, but Flower doesn't argue that humanity is at war with Mother Nature, instead suggests that the two can coexist. Two opposing forces collide, then merge, and that story emerges purely through gameplay and level design, putting an end to any doubt that Flower is less a game than any other systems-driven experience. The power, however, comes not from accomplishing tasks but in the very act of moving and existing. In this sense, you can see how Flower, originally released on the PlayStation 3 in 2009, planted the seeds that led to the developer's follow-up, Journey. Like Flower, Journey leads you to an emotional nadir before thrusting you into a glorious awakening, and like Journey, Flower herds you back into its levels' confines if you try to venture outside of them, though it does so with some awkwardness, in contrast to Journey's subtle nudges."", 'Just as you might improperly dismiss Flower as ""not a game,"" you might also improperly dismiss it for its brevity: You could easily finish in an hour, and that hour progresses at a relaxed pace, lulling you into security rather than pumping adrenaline into your nerves. But value is more than a simple price-to-minutes ratio, and I\'d sooner revisit Flower\'s serenity than countless 50-hour grindfests. Like a snowy mountain ridge or a tranquil river valley, Flower invites introspection and inner calm, and that kind of interactive experience is almost as rare now as it was when I first surfed these winds.']"Carolyn Petit,13-Nov-13,Contrast Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/contrast-review/1900-6415539/,5,PS4,"[""Contrast is a game concerned with intangible ideas: the substance of a shadow, and the makeup of a child's broken heart. As a mysterious figure named Dawn, you aid a young girl named Didi in her efforts to prevent her family from falling apart. You don't exist fully in Didi's reality; rather, she is the only person you can see and who can see you. Everyone else appears as a mere shadow projected on the wall, and you yourself have the ability to shift between a corporeal, three-dimensional existence and a silhouetted, two-dimensional one. Contrast conjures up a captivating and surreal mid-20th century European atmosphere of jazz clubs and cabaret singers, and its use of shadows is sometimes striking. But Contrast's puzzles and platforming rarely call for you to do more than go through the motions, and far too often, the roughness of its physics shatters the elegant ambiance of its world."", 'Didi\'s parents are on the rocks, and as you follow the intrepid Didi through town on her quest to keep her family together, the story of their troubled romance plays out in shadow vignettes. Noir-flavored dialogue gives the interactions of the troubled lovers a smoky edge; when Kat tells Johnny that he\'s ""a carousel of broken dreams,"" you might feel like you\'re in the midst of an intoxicating, Casablanca-esque love story. And indeed, the game makes a few explicit references to that classic film.', ""But these enticing glimpses of a rocky relationship between two strong-willed people aren't just for show. As the characters' large shadows play out their parts in these scenes, you can shift into a shadow yourself, leaping on their outstretched arms or their shoulders and using their movements to help you reach places you otherwise couldn't. You can leap onto just about any shadow on any wall, and a few basic puzzles require you to manipulate light sources so that objects cast shadows that you can use to your advantage. And in one elaborate and especially enjoyable sequence, you fill in for a princess puppet in a story about a brave, knight-rescuing princess that Didi's father cooks up to entertain his daughter. The imagery and dialogue of these shadow vignettes make Contrast a distinctive and intermittently seductive experience."", 'As you progress through the game, you earn a few new abilities that you must put to use to advance, including a dash move that lets you pass through thin shadows, and the ability to pick up boxes or spheres and shift them into shadow form. This latter ability factors into the occasional puzzle that offers a satisfying ""aha!"" moment as the pieces fall into place and you realize what you need to do to get the box to its destination.', ""But for the most part, what you need to do is plain as day, and once the pleasure of being in Contrasts world has worn off, the act of carrying boxes around and pushing switches to make machinery do its thing becomes routine. The ability to shift objects in and out of shadow form also leads to frustration, because it's extremely common for Dawn to become stuck in the environment when snapping out of shadow form with an item in hand. You can usually get Dawn unstuck by leaping or dashing or just wobbling around for a bit, but the prevalence of this problem pulls you out of the mood Contrast's atmosphere and story strive to foster."", ""There are collectibles throughout Contrast that shed a bit of light on the narrative, but the ultimate explanation of Dawn's existence is cursory and unrewarding. And despite a few strong moments, the game more often flounders in its efforts to mix substance and shadow into an enjoyable cocktail. The alchemy of Contrast doesn't quite pay off, and in the end, the game feels as insubstantial as the shadows that populate its world.""]"Peter Brown,13-Nov-13,Resogun Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resogun-review/1900-6415541/,8,PS4,"[""Resogun is a supercharged reimagining of the classic 1980 arcade game Defender. From a presentation standpoint, the unorthodox use of voxels makes it a bit of a curiosity, too. These tiny building blocks allow the environment to crumble when enemies crash and explode nearby, culminating in the total destruction of every stage. It's destructible environments taken to the extreme, and an impressive display of next-gen technology to boot, but Resogun isn't a game that relies on visual gimmicks."", ' ', ""Comparing Resogun to Defender gives you a basic understanding of the game's structure. Both are side-scrolling spaceship shooters that let you freely move left or right and encourage you to rescue stranded humans sprinkled throughout each stage. However, Resogun is a bit different from its muse, with the playing field wrapped around a large cylinder, rather than represented as a looping 2D map, and most importantly, your ship has far greater firepower and maneuverability than your the meager ship in Defender. With these modern trappings, whether you're zipping through waves of enemies, luring them into a trap, or decimating entire phalanxes in a flash, there's rarely a lull in the action."", 'The near nonstop assault on your ship comes from a variety of enemies, some small and some large, with different flight patterns and behaviors. There are swarms of gnat-like vessels that track your movement, free-floating laser cannons that can block your path, and other ships that divide into smaller but equally deadly units upon impact. Quite often, you can fly to a less-populated section of a stage and catch your breath when things get too frantic, but at some point, you have to face the enemies you left behind.', ' ', 'On top of your battle for self-preservation, there are other lives worth fighting for. Throughout each stage, 10 or so human captives await rescue, which comes only when you shoot down green ""keeper"" ships. These enemies fly solo or in groups, appearing for brief windows of time before slipping out of sight for good. Felling these wardens-in-flight frees a particular captive, who aimlessly wander around the level, waiting for a ride home before they\'re recaptured. If you\'re shot down while the humans are on the ground, or if you ignore them for too long and lose sight of the keeper ships, it\'s the end of the road for the unfortunate humans. But should you manage to scoop them up and deliver them to one of two tractor beams at the top of the stage, you collect a reward in the form of points or equipment upgrades.', ' ', ""It's challenging to focus on keepers and humans when you've got problems of your own, but shield and weapon upgrades are vital to your continued success. They allow you to absorb an extra hit and extend the strength and reach of your weapons. You constantly need to balance the associated risks and rewards of trying to be a hero. Making the most of a situation and getting out alive requires quick reflexes. Thankfully, Resogun's controls are tight, and you've got three abilities to exploit along the way."", ""Each of your three ships comes equipped with a trio of tools: boost, overdrive, and bombs. Bombs in Resogun do what any good bomb should: blow up everything in sight. There's a trade-off to consider when chasing high scores, though. With no enemies to shoot, it's next to impossible to continue chaining kills quickly enough to build up your score multiplier, which is the key to hitting the top of the leaderboard."", ' ', ""When enemies die, be it from a standard cannon or a bomb, they leave behind a collection of green voxels that you can collect to fill your ship's overdrive meter. Once your meter's at capacity, activating overdrive expends this energy as an enormous jet for a limited amount of time. Boost might not sound like an ability that feeds into your ship's destructive tendencies, but this evasive maneuver ends with a bang, killing anything in close proximity. Unlike with overdrive, you have control over the duration of boosting, allowing you to strategically conserve resources, or plow into enemy ranks, destroying them from within."", ' ', ""Live long enough to see the end of a stage, and you're rewarded by a meeting with one of Resogun's five gigantic bosses. Unlike typical ships, most bosses come in complex and unusual forms. You can attack some of these juggernauts freely, but other bosses require pinpoint marksmanship. The first stage boss, for example, is a giant two-tiered ring with laser cannons floating in the space between each ring. You have to shoot your way through the first ring and navigate the laser-filled void to reach the boss's weak spot in the middle. It's not a ground-breaking boss design, but it does change up the pace of Resogun's core gameplay between stages."", ' ', ""Bosses are also relentlessly strong. In the game's later stages, surviving a boss's onslaught is next to impossible without enough extra lives and bombs to turn the tide in your favor. In these cases, the biggest challenge is the fight leading up to the boss. Fail to play your best, and it's easy to end up at a boss with little hope for success, though even if you have a healthy stash of extra lives and bombs, you can't brute-force your way through a fight. These unforgiving confrontations motivate you to perform at your best, making victory that much sweeter when it comes."", ""Resogun's controls, presentation, and rapid-fire enemy assaults make for an exciting experience. You're constantly under pressure, practically suffocating behind swarms of enemies, but you're never without the means for survival. In this way, playing Resogun is an exercise in twitch gameplay and decision making, triggering a rush of adrenaline and testing the limits of your ability. It helps that the accompanying beat of the techno-laden soundtrack and the constant trickle of voxels are mesmerizing, pulling you into the moment every step of the way."", ' ', ""The only downside to Resogun is the short-stack of levels you get to explore. There are four difficulties to choose from, which provides a bit of variety, but the game's five stages don't stay fresh forever. Having three ships helps, but it doesn't take long for the flow of surprises to dry up and the race for high scores to take over. That said, Resogun remains fun to play even when the joy of discovery fades away. It's classic arcade action imbued with hard-hitting artistic and gameplay elements. Falling in love with Resogun is easy, and mastering it is challenging, and the combination of these two qualities makes Resogun almost impossible to put down."", ' ', ""Editor's note: Resogun's online coop mode was not available when this review was published.

Intake steps in as an excellent light gun game, reminiscent of a strange mash-up of Ikaruga and House of the Dead, built on a tongue-in-cheek presentation of rave and drug culture. It's a curious marriage, but one that works well, creating an exceptionally satisfying, brutally difficult modern reinterpretation and refinement of classic mechanics."", 'Running Intake for the first time opens a menu with three graphics options--Pep Rally, Dance Party, and Sparkle Party--and these options make for an accurate introduction to the frenetic shooter. Intake is a game about drugs...sort of. There\'s no serious political message besides the 1980s arcade callback screen showing the phrase ""Winners Don\'t Use Drugs."" Beyond that, there isn\'t even a direct reference to anything illegal, but the intent is clear.', 'During play, you\'re assaulted by a never-ending stream of colored pills falling from the sky. The right mouse button changes the color of your cursor, and the left mouse button destroys whatever pill is in your reticle. At the bottom of the screen, you have a ""shield"" that blocks any pill that doesn\'t match the color of your cursor. Each level has only two colors, to keep things simple, but every level changes up the palette to a new set of vibrant, neon-soaked hues. If a pill falls below your shield and you don\'t manage to destroy it before it falls off the screen, you die of an overdose.', 'Those are the basics, but the bare-bones tutorial doesn\'t even say that much. Advanced mechanics, such as chaining combos, snagging power-ups, and something I\'ve come to call ""bumping"" pills, are never mentioned or introduced, which is a shame, because these advanced bits make Intake compelling.', ""Each pill you hit with the properly colored cursor starts or continues a combo. If you miss your target, however, the combo drops, and you need to start over again. If you destroy a pill with your shield, you're safe, but you don't get any benefits. Combos are critical because they act as score multipliers that increase the in-game currency yield of each round. The points you earn, appropriately measured in milligrams, are used to unlock more colors, more music, additional lives, and power-ups. As the pace of the game picks up, all but the best players will be lost without these power-ups and extra lives, so unlocking them as early as possible is important. There's a decent variety of power-ups as well: one increases the size of pills to make them easier to hit, another one slows down time so you can pick them off with a bit more accuracy, and yet another launches a bolt of lighting that bounces between pills destroying each one it encounters up to a preset limit. Which power-up you get is randomly determined, but you can unequip the ones you've unlocked to limit drops to the one or two you like the most."", ""Intake draws heavy inspiration from modern rave culture, a sort of bass-driven sensory overload environment where you and the other club-goers teeter on the brink of mental breakdown tapping into the state of mind that stands as the namesake for one of the scene's most popular substances. Aesthetically, Intake captures the feeling almost perfectly. It's loud, obnoxious, and altogether trance-inducing. When the game really got going during intense challenge matches or in some of its later levels, I felt myself achieving a sense of flow that's remarkably uncommon in a fair portion of today's games. Play becomes euphoric as the pace increases--faster and faster--and once you've built up a decent momentum, the experience is unreal."", 'Intake is a spectacularly minimal game that contains a staggering amount of complexity with just a handful of straightforward concepts.', ""Achieving that state is easy because everything fits together so comfortably. Everything you can do presents its own risk/reward payoff, and Intake asks you to make so many choices so quickly that, at best, you end up operating on instinct and playing with sheer technical skill. If, for example, you finish a level while an untriggered power-up is on the field, it explodes into a small starbust of tablets, each worth 10 milligrams. Those can, in turn, collide with the tablets that appear in a rainbow shape at the end of every level, making it harder to hit them all and pick up a small completion bonus. Wildly clicking to hit all of the end-of-level tablets helps for a few seconds, but as soon as the next level's pills start falling, missed clicks suddenly count against you once again, and you risk dropping your combo. Picking up extra in-game currency becomes a challenge to gather as much as you can before you risk killing the very thing that multiplies the currency you can pick up."", ""Perhaps an even tougher choice on the higher levels is whether or not to grab an extra life. On the one hand, it can replenish the one resource that keeps you clicking away at pills longer. On the other hand, the extra life releases a burst upon collection that typically pushes all the pills onscreen closer to the edge, and much like those pills, once the collectible is off the map, it's gone and you're out of luck."", 'Challenge levels push your skills and the criticality of snap decisions to the limit starting after level 25. There are four different types. Flood stages do just as their name implies and slowly fill the screen with countless pills, typically far more than you could ever hope to click through. Acceleration does just the opposite, sending a few pills rocketing across the screen at insane speeds. Minefield uses an abundance of flashbangs, which are colorless pills that freeze your screen for a second, causing you to lose track of standard pills. The last is called Reaction, and it makes nearly all of the pills detonate violently upon destruction. Typically, that\'s a good thing, since it wipes out a good chunk of pills all at once, but in this case, careful clicks are the only thing that stand between you and dozens of stray, hypervelocity bits of ""medicine."" These stages are randomly triggered and mixed in with the normal ones, keeping the level of challenge on the ridiculous end of the spectrum throughout.', ""Intake is a spectacularly minimal game that contains a staggering amount of complexity with just a handful of straightforward concepts. The only issue, besides the aforementioned semi-useless tutorial, is the exceptionally small music selection. While the tracks are excellent, it's odd that there are only three. The backbone of rave culture is exciting, pulsing music, and more is always better. I've dumped a good 10 hours into the game so far, and I can't say I'm sick of any of these songs, but that might not be the case for everyone."", ""Games that can, through abstraction, accurately capture the distilled essence of a much larger experience are truly special. Intake is one of them; it uses a few simple ideas to build a complicated affair. It's not quite the relaxing, surreal Dyad, but it does tackle the kind of frenetic, euphoric atmosphere of the modern electronic dance music scene. If you have even the slightest appreciation for score challenges, shoot-'em-ups, or light-gun anything, Intake will keep you popping pills for quite some time.""]"Jason Venter,11-Nov-13,Final Exam Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-exam-review/1900-6415540/,5,PS3,"[' ', ""Sometimes, it's fun to whale on the slimy, disgusting legions of darkness while ignoring thoughts about more-productive things to do with your time. Final Exam, a brawler that tells the story of a high school reunion gone horribly wrong, lets you do precisely that. Over the course of your nocturnal adventure, you and your friends ride an out-of-control subway, navigate creepy tunnels, and get to the root of the monster problem that has made your night so very interesting. It's an old-school ride, a mix of dozens of retro games you've probably played many times before, and mostly it works out fine. Just don't expect a crash course in innovation."", ""At its heart, Final Exam is a basic brawler. You choose one of the four heroes--each with differing stats and an individual skill tree--and then you start running and jumping through a series of indistinct environs that include the sort of fare you'd expect to see in a low-budget horror flick. Inevitably, you find yourself beset upon by small groups of nasty humanoids, at which point you need to respond with wrenches, pipes, chainsaws, and such, or else eat a slimy knuckle sandwich."", 'The fighting is somewhat interesting, thanks mostly to combos. You can take turns exchanging punches with the slobbering hordes, or you can dash or cartwheel around to remain a moving target. As you knock everyone else about without taking hits--assisted, perhaps, by air juggles and the like--you build up a higher combo count, and that in turn produces a higher score. You gain stat points if you beat benchmarks for each zone, which makes you more lethal still, so it definitely pays to master the skills that take you from a featherweight to a heavyweight.', ""Basic melee abilities you have access to from the very start are complemented by projectile weapons and explosives, which you use more effectively once you assign stat points. You can expand your inventory of melee weapons, guns, and explosives by finding crates secreted throughout the various locales. Items are plentiful, since every other humanoid slimeball you eradicate seems to leave behind a box of shells, a Molotov cocktail, or a health-restoring value meal. Fights aren't interesting if you're just mashing buttons, but when you get into the spirit of things, it's a fun challenge to keep combos going and scores rising as you mix together a collection of melee attacks, bursts of gunfire, and well-timed blasts."", ""As your character improves, you also find yourself making frequent stops at the skill tree between levels. What you can unlock depends on what you've already accessed, and also on the percentage of the game you have cleared. It's possible for the jock to throw up shields so that he can withstand a few hits without taking damage, for instance, but only after learning more basic skills that lead up to that point. Early on, it's difficult to decide what you want the most (there are only so many points to go around), so building the ultimate warrior out of your washed-up quarterback, or nerd, or cheerleader (Hello, stereotypes!) is an involving exercise."", ""Final Exam doesn't limit itself to the brawling, though, which is where it runs into trouble. Stages routinely require you to complete basic chores, and those get old quickly. In the first proper stage, you're required to find fuel canisters so you can coax a generator to life. Later, you need to collect the members of a scattered elementary class that is inexplicably late returning to the school bus from a visit to the ghoulish theme park. Sometimes, you have to escort a fat mechanic or a scientist, while whaling on beasts that accost you. These segments are all more or less the same, and don't work as much of a diversion because they force you to plod along lengthy corridors that are mostly unremarkable except for nicely drawn backdrops. You can look for hidden items along the way, but that's only interesting the first time you tackle a stage. Visiting again later, when the area is stripped to its bare bones, is downright tedious."", 'Final Exam often feels a bit too much like homework for its own good.', ""Fortunately, you can play cooperatively with friends, either locally or online. This is the best way to enjoy the game, because it introduces potential for conflict that doesn't exist if you're going alone. Everyone can work on separate objectives at once, competing to gather the most goodies, and performances are ranked at the end of each stage (as well as on leaderboards that taunt you even when you're doing things alone). Scoring adds an additional incentive to play well, and joining other players makes dealing with some of the bosses--particularly the perilous final foe--a great deal more manageable. If one player loses his last life, he isn't out of the action: another player can revive him. Less-skilled players can also make nice targets to distract a brute so that you can deal him a load of pain."", ""From beginning to end, Final Exam's campaign lasts three to four hours, and you can play through it again with each of the four separate characters. There are additional difficulty settings, as well, but any interest you might have in clearing everything is tempered by the monotony that serves as filler between the occasional highlights. The game looks good and has a sweet rocking soundtrack accompanying the action, it could have benefited from a greater variety where its core components are concerned. More-distinct objectives and enemies would have gone a long way."", ""Final Exam often feels too much like homework for its own good, but it still proves enjoyable in between the monotonous fetching and the too-long corridors with nothing to see, particularly when played with a friend or three. If you're looking for a competent but unremarkable trip down a familiar path, you should find enough to be a happy student for at least a few hours.""]"Cameron Woolsey,11-Nov-13,Ratchet & Clank: Into the Nexus Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ratchet-clank-into-the-nexus-review/1900-6415538/,8,PS3,"[""Ratchet & Clank: Into the Nexus is a lean, mean machine. It doesn't represent a great departure from the franchise, but instead hones in on what made the games so fun in the first place: fast-paced, gun-toting mayhem. It's a laugh a minute in this exuberant return to form, which has the heroic lombax coming to terms with his rightful place in the universe."", 'Following the events of Ratchet & Clank Future: A Crack in Time, the heroic duo is transporting the infamous criminal Vendra Prog to a detention center. In an explosive introduction, Vendra is rescued by her twin brother Neftin Prog and his horde of Cockney-voiced hired goons working for Thugs-4-Less. What follows is a daring chase by Ratchet and Clank as they hop among five different planets in pursuit of the fleeing felons. Coming in at around five hours, the budget-priced Into the Nexus is short, but that brevity supports its narrative purpose. This is an epilogue, designed to cap off the Future trilogy of games and tie up loose ends in the process.', ' ', 'The classic sense of humor of the franchise remains intact and always hilarious. The jokes come early and often throughout the campaign, from slapstick moments thanks to the bumbling gator-faced Thugs-4-Less goons, to the zany array of weapons. For example, there is a gun that lobs a grenade that summons a ghoul in the form of a pirate or clown to scare enemies, and another called the Winterizer, which plays holiday music while turning foes into grinning snowmen brandishing candy canes.', ""It's hard not to get a warm chuckle out of the franchise's geriatric robot heroes, Cronk and Zephyr, who adorably bicker over war stories and age. From amusing dialogue to dry, subtle jokes buzzing in from various intercoms in certain stages, the game erupts with wit and charm. The humor is sprinkled throughout a smart script narrated by a fantastic vocal cast, with guest appearances from Talwyn Apogee, the Plumber, the Smuggler, and of course, Captain Qwark, who is as useless and unwanted as expected."", 'By stripping out the elements that bogged down prior games, Into the Nexus becomes a playground of gun smoke and noise where the person with the biggest toys is the one left standing.', ""A new enemy comes in the form of the Nethers, ghostly creatures from another dimension called the Netherverse. These beings are far more formidable than the usual thugs, and pop in and out of the dimension during battles. Early in the course of the campaign, Clank gains the ability to enter the cracks in reality leading to the Netherverse, thanks to the eccentric scientist Pollyx. Clank traverses the shadowy Netherverse in the style of a 2D platformer where gravity is controlled using the right analogue stick. The goal: get Clank to be chased by a Nether beast through the crack, which causes the wall to explode, allowing the two heroes to continue their quest. Clank's adventures in the Nether are rare, but they become challenging, as getting to the exit means executing quick gravity shifts while dodging floating spiked rocks and hazardous burning floors."", ""This is a simpler Ratchet, unfettered by an overabundance of jumping and moving platforms. Over the course of the franchise, Insomniac has experimented with new gadgets and moves to enhance the scope of platforming. Into the Nexus firmly plants its boot down on the side of action, focusing on the big guns and the legions of enemies you fire them at. There is platforming, but much of it has been toned down. There are no more ledges to shimmy along nor are there rails to grind, and using the OmniWrench to manipulate platforms is all but forgotten. Puzzles are nonexistent outside of a few simple box arrangements in Clank's visits to the Nether. The pared-down platforming might disappoint you if you enjoy giving the jump button a workout, but I felt the change in pace to be exactly what the series needed. By stripping out the elements that bogged down prior games, Into the Nexus becomes a playground of gun smoke and noise where the person with the biggest toys is the one left standing. The action and small environments keep the pace lightning quick, with two planets that mainly exist to offer a short list of optional side missions."", ""Adding to the enjoyment are tighter controls, which have been tweaked to let Ratchet use his hoverboots without needing to equip them first. Some planets allow Ratchet to utilize a jetpack he wins at the Destructapalooza, a battle arena on Planet Kragg, so that he may reach previously inaccessible heights. It's exhilarating to streak across the environment in hoverboots and then blast off into the skies, and dropping from the strata onto unaware enemies instills a sense of empowerment. This is still the Ratchet & Clank you know and love, but the dull humdrum has been all but banished."", 'New weapons are unlocked quickly and often, along with copious amounts of bolts and caches of raritanium to use for upgrades. Weapon upgrading has been expanded, allowing you to choose which features you want for your favorite tool of destruction. The upgrade screen is a map of branching grey hexagons, each of which grants a new ability such as increased ammo count, weapon range, or extra bolts for each enemy kill. Green hexagons adorned with question marks are mystery upgrades, and can only be unlocked after clearing all the grey hexagons surrounding it. Much like before, weapons level up with use, and the weapon wheel is larger on the screen, making it faster than ever to choose the item you want.', ""The series is well known for its colossal arsenal of strange and fantastic weaponry, and Into the Nexus follows suit. Over the years, however, the weapons selection in each game has become somewhat uninspired, a fact that unfortunately befalls Into the Nexus. During the course of the game, I rarely used more than a chosen few weapons out of the 12 available, though those weapons were always a blast to use. In particular, I'm a fan of the returning Mr. Zurkon, a sarcastic, snarky battle bot who speaks in the third person while harassing Ratchet for his organic faults. The Netherblades, which send a storm of whirling purple blades that ricochet off walls and surround enemies, is another easy favorite."", ""Ratchet & Clank: Into the Nexus doesn't entirely break from the series' classic roots, but its focus on action over platforming makes it a fast-paced thrill ride."", ""Early in the game you earn a new tool called the Grav-Tether. Firing it at grav-targets creates a purple grav-stream that you ride on to get to new areas. The concept is fairly straightforward: firing the tether activates one target, while firing at another will create a stream flowing to that second target. It is typically used to float over deadly drops or reach higher ground. Astute players will spot areas where the tether offers access to hidden areas, which often have secret items such as RYNO VII plans or gold bolts tucked away. You can have other kinds of fun with the tether as well; trapping enemies in the grav-stream and canceling it as they float helplessly above a cliff is good for a quick laugh. Though an interesting new addition to Ratchet's usual repertoire of tools, the game forgets about the Grav-Tether over time, and it goes into disuse by the final chapter."", ""Completing the game unlocks Challenge Mode which allows you to restart the campaign at a higher difficulty but with all the weapons you've unlocked. This mode applies a bolt multiplier which lets you unlock more upgrades for your weapons and level them up to golden Omega status using gold bolts hidden throughout the game. Challenge Mode is a fantastic way to really get some bang for your buck. Your weapons become more powerful with new upgrades, and the mode gives you a chance to try out others you may have neglected on your first playthrough. You also have the option to jump back into your game after the credits roll to mop up any leftover side missions, earn better boss battle scores, and grab some missing skill points. If you fancy a wave of nostalgia, visit the museum, which houses exhibits featuring the enemies and heroes who have graced the series. And in case you missed out, the game also comes with a copy of Ratchet & Clank Future: Quest for Booty."", ""Ratchet & Clank: Into the Nexus doesn't entirely break from the series' classic roots, but its focus on action over platforming makes it a fast-paced thrill ride, and the short length makes running through it again with Omega weapons in Challenge Mode irresistible. In what may be the last Ratchet & Clank for this console generation, the series takes its leave with a proper bang, reuniting you with your favorite characters and keeping you hooting and hollering all the way to the finish line.""]"Kevin VanOrd,11-Nov-13,BioShock Infinite Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea-episode-1-review/1900-6415528/,5,Xbox 360 & PC,"[""There's always a lighthouse. There's always a man. And now, there's also a gimmick."", ""Episode 1 of BioShock Infinite: Burial at Sea isn't a story that sheds new light on BioShock lore, but is rather a story that stitches together two worlds in ways that don't enhance either of them. The original BioShock's underwater objectivist dystopia known as Rapture was a unique and fearsome place, a testament to the chaos and uncertainty that emerges when man worships himself at his own altar. BioShock Infinite's floating city of Columbia was both a monument to manifest destiny and a tombstone marking the human empathy that perished when the city was born. Burial at Sea uncomfortably merges the two worlds, and diminishes Rapture's enduring legacy in doing so."", ""Burial at Sea is about moments. Beautiful moments, sad moments, perplexing moments. They often tug at your heart or stimulate your imagination, but fail to coalesce into a lucid whole. The opening is such a moment. Elizabeth enters Booker DeWitt's office, but she is not the Elizabeth you once knew. It is December 31, 1958, a storied date in Rapture's history, and Elizabeth is not a wide-eyed young woman, but a femme fatale who slinks into the room seeking Booker's assistance. Booker lights Elizabeth's cigarette with his bare flaming finger, rather than a lighter. Elizabeth blows smoke from the side of her mouth and shows Booker a photograph of a young girl and the girl's doll. Elizabeth wants Booker--that is, you--to find this girl. You, too, know this girl, and her identity is the mystery that catalyzes this short, story-driven adventure."", ""It's a cryptic opening that shares thematic ties with BioShock Infinite: again, you are off to find an unknown girl for reasons that you don't yet comprehend. Striking visuals and sounds at first intimate suspense. Elizabeth's high heels clatter on Booker's wooden floor, and the office's half-closed window blinds cast a band of shadows on the dingy wall. And when Booker follows Elizabeth out of the office, suspense is briefly replaced by nostalgia. You are not in Columbia, but in Rapture. No gods or kings. Only man."", 'This is not the largely abandoned Rapture of BioShock. It is alive and thriving. I was drawn in at first; this was a side of the city I hadn\'t seen. Men in bowler hats discussed the philosophies of the day (""What does Ryan say? Petty morality? You can keep it""), and women occupied themselves by applying makeup outside of busy department stores. But it soon became obvious that these people weren\'t living in this world, but functioned only as audiologs, created for my consumption. Of course, you could say the same about the citizens of Columbia, who spoke their lines only when you neared them, and otherwise remained in their poses, silent as mannequins.', ""The result is an adventure with fantastic sights and sounds that don't come together in a meaningful way."", ""The difference is that BioShock Infinite was an entirely new world, and overheard conversations were part of the discovery process. As one aspect of a fully imagined adventure, BioShock Infinite's dialogue contrivances barely registered with me. In this 90-minute side story, I was struck by how scripted the conversations were. This is because I had discovered Rapture already. As wonderful as it was to see a vibrant city nearing its inevitable collapse, these people weren't telling me anything I hadn't heard before, or giving me new perspective. They living automatons parroting the same themes of individual righteousness that BioShock had already fully explored. The idea of melding the universes which contained Columbia and Rapture sounds fascinating because of what new insights into the human condition it could offer, but Burial at Sea fails to delve further than the series has already gone before."", ""Nonetheless, there's true power in seeing known characters and places in a novel light. Again, Burial at Sea is about moments. An angelic walk down a sterile white corridor turns to horror as you come face-to-face with performance artist Sander Cohen, whose painted mustache and piercing brown eyes remain ever menacing. I will remember his theater for its red velvet curtains, its stoic audience members, and its smoky air--not to mention, for the horrors that I witnessed there. I will also remember Burial at Sea's ending, though not just for its symbolic and visual impact, but also for how plainly the game telegraphed it."", 'On the whole, however, Burial at Sea comes across more as a who\'s who of Rapture than as a powerful story on its own. And I say ""story"" rather than ""game"" purposefully: combat is more of an afterthought here than it has ever been in the BioShock games, and the action elements aren\'t easy fits in a world that wasn\'t thematically or architecturally designed for them. Granted, vigors are called plasmids here, but there\'s no obvious explanation for why they\'re named as they were in Columbia, or why they differ from the original BioShock\'s plasmids. This alteration is an overt contrivance, given how Burial at Sea otherwise goes out of its way to present its version of Rapture as otherwise adhering to the history we\'ve already learned. And even outside of thematic and historical concerns, characters don\'t always act in consistent ways. For example, after urging you to turn a valve, Elizabeth then acts shocked that you\'ve turned it, even though it was her request--and even though the game requires that you do it to continue.', ""Soon after you arrive in Frank Fontaine's derelict department store, you find gear that allows you to perform melee attacks on splicers from a good distance away, which makes Burial at Sea remarkably easy. Nevertheless, there are other methods of killing your foes, including a new weapon called the radar range, which looks like a desk fan and emits beams of deadly energy. You can also take splicers down from above: BioShock Infinite's skyrails and skyhook take on new names, but they function the same here as they did in Columbia. They're significantly less enjoyable to use in the confines of Fontaine's store, however, where there is too little space to traverse, and no open vistas to instill the joy of grinding the rails. Elizabeth's ability to tear holes into space-time and bring helpful objects like gun turrets and ammo stashes into existence is also an odd fit: Elizabeth provides a brief explanation, and Booker immediately starts to order Elizabeth to create tears, as if he innately understands the full extent of their potential in a matter of seconds. This unwieldy cramming together of elements that don't mesh comes to a head in the final boss battle, during which taking to a skyhook can result in a quick demise for reasons that aren't readily apparent."", ""BioShock Infinite's ending implied an endless multiverse of possibilities. Infinite men. Infinite worlds. Infinite stories of oppression, self-discovery, and redemption to tell. Columbia itself is an intriguing place soaked in history and delusion, with a lifetime of tales its citizens might have told. Rather than telling those tales, Irrational Games focused on a flawed what-if scenario and crafted an equally flawed story to fit it. Burial at Sea seems a prime example of the tail wagging the dog, and the result is an adventure with fantastic sights and sounds that don't come together in a meaningful way.""]"Leif Johnson,11-Nov-13,XCOM: Enemy Within Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/xcom-enemy-within-review/1900-6415533/,8,PC & Xbox 360 & PS3,"[' ', 'Several hours into XCOM: Enemy Within, pumping bullets into extraterrestrials and sending aircraft to chase UFOs, I found myself thinking of Dragon\'s Dogma: Dark Arisen. Rest assured, there are no dragons here, but Firaxis\' beloved tactical shooter follows much the same model as Capcom\'s role-playing game in offering what some may call an ""ultimate"" edition of 2012\'s turn-based strategy hit. In this latest jaunt, hours filled with the same cutscenes of Dr. Vahlen and Dr. Chen bickering over the same priorities rush by. The enemy is known now, at least for those of us who played XCOM: Enemy Unknown before, and thus some of the mystery has passed away. But as I ventured deeper into alien bases and terrorist cells, I found myself thinking of XCOM: Enemy Within more as an alternate reality. It\'s an approach that makes facing the alien menace exciting all over again.', 'The key to these changes lies in the game\'s opening quote. Whereas before you were presented with Arthur C. Clarke\'s famed quote about being alone in the universe, Enemy Within greets you with a more ominous message penned by R. Buckminster Fuller: ""Those who play with the devil\'s toys will be brought by degrees to wield his sword."" By slow degrees, easing through the same missions and viewing the same spaceships and alien bases, it\'s clear that the enemy lies just as much among our fellow humans as it does beyond the stars. XCOM: Enemy Within sees Vahlen and Chen pushing the moral limits of technology and running the risk of smudging forever the line between humans and aliens. Beyond, a rogue organization named EXALT seeks to thwart XCOM\'s efforts, believing that a better future lies with the very aliens you fought.', ""With so much smudging of the lines between human and machine, it's surprising that XCOM: Enemy Within does such a good job of emphasizing the humanity of its soldiers. No more do heavies from Argentina chat in the same vernacular as Illinois car salesmen; instead, French and Polish units bark announcements in the tongues of their respective countries if you activate them in the customization screen. You don't have to play match-two with languages and the flags on soldiers' backs; it's a pleasure to switch out between French, German, Spanish, Italian, Polish, and Russian, but it's a shame that the available voices never move beyond the European sphere and into languages like Japanese and Chinese."", ""Other touches add a bit of swagger and even light humor. Enhanced customization options now let soldiers venture forth in fedoras as well as combat helmets, and a handful of different armor types helps distinguish soldiers from one another on the battlefield. As a result, much more than before, soldiers feel like people. You feel your losses even more now, particularly when you've already awarded a soldier with one of the new medals using your (permanent) choice of two buffs."", ""But nothing changes the game quite like meld. Meld is a new resource in XCOM: Enemy Within, and while you could theoretically finish the game without using it, doing so means you'll miss out on some of the expansion's greatest goodies. Even the resource itself augments the experience. The realization that you have only a limited number of turns to reach it depending on the difficulty, for instance, almost immediately shatters the careful inch-by-inch tactics so commonly employed in the first game. The intent here is speed, and the occasional need for recklessness adds an extra dose of tension to most missions. That's not to say the changes don't properly mesh with the returning tactical mechanics; on the contrary, you usually have to move your main force to objectives while sending out a party of one or two to snag the meld."", ""Back at the base, meld reveals itself to be a Prometheus' fire of sorts that allows both genetic modifications and cybernetics. Gene mods are the comparatively mundane choice of the two, and using them is a little like playing the original game with superhero buffs. Some are fairly simple, such as pupil implants that grant a small boost to aim; others are almost godly, such as a skin augment that makes your soldier invisible if she's in full cover. It's cool stuff, and it's most noteworthy for making Dr. Vahlen's dissections more meaningful."", ""It's the same game through a twisted mirror, revealing an alternative world where humans strive to win at any cost."", ""MEC troopers are something else entirely. They're exactly what they sound like, MechWarrior fans, and you can sacrifice any of your team members to go the way of Robocop as long as they've progressed past rookie. The short wait is a smart move, particularly since leveling now lets them retain at least one ability associated with their previous roles. A support character, for instance, might throw up a huge shield that boosts defenses for surrounding combatants. On the battlefield, they come into their own, possessing the ability to take as much damage as they dish out with flamethrowers and plasma rifles, forgoing cover and sometimes acting as cover for each other."", 'MEC troopers sound as badass as they do game breaking. Thankfully, Firaxis went to great lengths to ensure proper balance. For one, the aliens now have their own ""mectoids"" to counter yours. Any fears that MECs have made XCOM easier tend to vanish before the sight of mectoids wiping out entire poorly placed squadrons. Brazenly venturing ahead of the team also gets your MECs killed by drawing too much fire, and devastating MEC weapons such as flamethrowers usually have no effect on other MECs.', ""New enemies also pepper the landscape, although they're not as effective as they probably could be. Take the seeker. It may look like the fearsome metal squid monsters from The Matrix, complete with a stealth skill that renders it invisible, but in practice, it's scarcely more dangerous than a horsefly. After it breaks stealth and latches on to a soldier, it's little more than handy target practice for other troops."", ""More worthy of note is the traitorous group EXALT, which brings some memorable new missions and story twists with it, although EXALT is more dangerous in the metagame than when you're fighting its members while trying to extract your spies in a series of new covert missions. Crafty buggers, they hack into Vahlen's research, disrupting her progress. They steal from your money reserves, and they spread panic through propaganda. Before, it wasn't hard to master the metagame's system of checks and balances, but EXALT ensures that managing panic levels and a steady cash flow now present greater challenges than before."", ""In some ways, however, all these additions act merely as frosting on a cake we've enjoyed before. It's the same game through a twisted mirror, revealing an alternative world where humans strive to win at any cost. In the process, it embraces science fiction with greater gusto. Before, it was easy to imagine XCOM as a fanciful take on how we'd fare if aliens attacked the world today. Enemy Within, on the other hand, sometimes ventures far into the theatrical, such as when you watch two MECs clobber each other as though in homage to Pacific Rim."", 'Enemy Within is great, but its greatness comes with qualifications. Players who have never played XCOM: Enemy Unknown will find their best entry point here, since it remedies some of the concerns of the original and manages to keep others from taking their place. Not only does it enhance replay value by expanding the Second Wave content to include options such as Training Roulette, which randomizes abilities while leveling, but it expands the multiplayer mode, adding squad editing, squad saving, and the inclusion of new units such as mectoids and seekers.', ""It also seems to avoid many of the pitfalls of the original. I saw not one bug in my hours with XCOM: Enemy Within, and the whopping 40 new maps ensured that even the usually humdrum UFO crash investigations of the original were replaced with tense excavations into cities and pleasant farms. All of that is certainly enough for PC players to fork out the $20 for the upgrade, but unfortunately, console players face the more daunting task of buying Firaxis' new creation for almost the price of a new game. Fortunately, there's enough new content here to justify it for players looking for another spin in Firaxis' gripping tale of alien invasion."", ""That seems to be the pattern of XCOM. The tale always grows in the telling, and with this entry, you find yourself in a world richer and more enjoyable than the one you experienced before. With a world this finely crafted, it's fitting that we should get to save it all over again.""]"Chris Barylick,11-Nov-13,Stick it to the Man!

And if that pink spaghetti arm can read the minds of those around you, peel back elements of the world as if they were stickers, help you swing from ledge to ledge and grab objects around you, so much the better.', ""Stick It to the Man is the story of Ray Doewood, a professional hardhat tester who was clonked on the noggin by a mysterious package dropped from a military airplane during a freak thunderstorm and wakes up to find a pink spaghetti arm emerging from his head. Within hours of this discovery, Ray learns that he's the target of a citywide manhunt. He has been accused of murdering his girlfriend, and the effort to find Ray and the arm has been orchestrated by a shadowy government figure known as The Man. Excellent voice acting brings each over-the-top character to life throughout the game's 10 chapters. This is a world filled with the random thoughts of aliens, insane psychiatrists, presidential brains in jars, and government agents wondering about Descartes. Ray's voice rehashes the works of Woody Allen, especially as he cites his plethora of neuroses."", ""Stick It to the Man is a puzzle platformer with a dark, twisted 2D art style reminiscent of Double Fine's Psychonauts. The arm proves invaluable and you can readily use its telepathic mode to read the thoughts of the people, animals, and robots around you to learn what they need and what puzzles you should be trying to solve."", ""The surreal artistic style isn't the only aspect of Stick It to the Man that that's a bit twisted; the sense of logic has just as many oddball wrinkles. In the space of a few minutes, you might peel back the corner of a building to reveal the people inside, use the pink spaghetti arm to read a nearby poodle's thoughts to learn that it wants more-ferocious teeth, use the arm to steal a set of false teeth from a nearby person's mouth, and slap the false teeth into the dog's mouth all to the tune of the game's noire jazz tunes."", ""The arm emerging from Ray's head is a remarkable and useful appendage. Need to reach a ledge? Just aim the spaghetti arm at a pin above the ledge, and trigger the arm to grab the pin, swinging Ray along in the process.

They're pretty gross looking, after all, and they serve no real purpose other than to wake you up by skittering along the wood floor of your bedroom in the middle of the night. Yet science suggests that these nasty creatures would outlast humans in a nuclear apocalypse, which is the basis for Journey of a Roach, a point-and-click adventure game that does the impossible: it makes roaches likable."", ""Perhaps even more impressive is that it does so without any dialogue. Journey of a Roach tells the story of two roaches: Jim and his clumsy buddy, Bud. Upon getting a glimpse of a flower growing in the barren wasteland of what appears to be a postapocalyptic Earth, Bud tries to guide Jim to the beautiful plant, only to fall deep underground where all sorts of mutated bugs live. On your journey to rescue him, you discover a world full of interesting and varied characters, all brimming with plot and personality despite never speaking a word. It's as if Pixar's A Bug's Life merged with the animated movie 9."", ""As a roach, one of your biggest advantages is the ability to crawl up walls and across ceilings, which is immediately neat and useful. You can move freely around the environment with the keyboard or analog stick, and climbing walls makes traversal easy. There are occasional issues with movement, such as when you might not be able to climb onto something that should be no real obstacle for a roach, or moments when the camera rotation is disorienting when you're climbing on ceilings (particularly in one section with air vents you must crawl through), but for the most part, getting around is not a problem."", 'Since Journey of a Roach has no dialogue and isn\'t heavy on story, the majority of the experience comes down to solving puzzles. This is where the game\'s point-and-click inspirations are clearest; most puzzles boil down to the tried-and-true ""find item in one area, use item somewhere else"" mechanics. That said, Journey of a Roach seems to have learned some lessons from both successful and failed adventure games of recent years, and most puzzle solutions do make logical sense (as opposed to requiring seemingly random item combinations that lead to more guesswork than brainpower, like many adventures of old).', ""Even if you get stuck, you can often get a subtle hint by hovering the cursor over a specific object, which can alleviate some of the frustration of not knowing what an inventory item might be used for. There are a few moments when you might have to resort to trial and error (one puzzle in particular I solved completely by accident, and I'm not sure I would have figured out the solution on my own), but generally, this hint system works well to inform you of exactly what you should be doing."", 'There is also a handy feature that lets you zoom out slightly and highlight ""hot spots"" (the objects in the environment you can interact with), which can help you locate some of the harder-to-find items. The small arrows it uses to point out objects of interest, however, aren\'t always enough help. It\'s still possible that you will spend more time than you\'d like beating your head against a puzzle only to discover that you missed the necessary item hidden in the corner of an adjacent room. In this sense, Journey of a Roach falls into the same sorts of traps many adventure games fall into, which you will either find nostalgic or frustrating, depending on your history with the genre.', ' ', ""Though the journey itself is charming, it's the puzzles that keep you pushing forward. None of the puzzles are especially demanding, and you can finish the game in a single two- to three-hour sitting, which feels like an appropriate length once the credits start rolling. Once you know all the solutions to the puzzles, however, the game can easily be completed in under half an hour (in fact, a Steam achievement awards you for finishing it in under 18 minutes). This is not a game for which you'll want to rely on a walkthrough, because it will be over far too quickly."", ""Journey of a Roach is a charming, worthwhile adventure with some clever puzzles and a nice cast of characters, though you may wish for a longer adventure for the price.

Whether you're hoisting a squad member up to higher ground, replenishing dwindling ammo supplies, or using a defibrillator to revive a fallen teammate, a sense of compulsory camaraderie drives the intense co-op missions. If your team doesn't work together as a cohesive unit, everyone dies. It's a cool hook that can alternately forge strong bonds or throw your crew into bickering turmoil. But beyond its spirited cooperative battles, Warface just doesn't do enough to set itself apart from other military shooters pushing up to the front lines this year."", 'One of Warface\'s biggest shortcomings is its generic setup, which inspires precious little excitement. Pitting the G.I. Joe-esque Warface faction against the special-ops-costumed Blackwood forces, the bland conflict contains only subtle hints of the game\'s military context, which is delivered in rambling radio chatter while you\'re waiting for your chopper to touch down at the start of each co-op mission. Once the door blasts open and your squad bolts into the line of fire, vague references to terrorists and chemical compounds quickly devolve into ""kill all of the bad dudes who are shooting at you."" The quasi-futuristic setting affords a few opportunities for the game to throw giant mechs and soldiers in heavy power armor at you, but otherwise, it\'s all familiar stuff.', 'This lack of a strong identity spills into the game\'s competitive multiplayer content. Sure, you find a decent mix of modes on tap, ranging from standard deathmatch and team deathmatch to bomb-planting runs and territory capture, but it\'s hard to shake the ""been there, done that"" vibe of these matches. Still, the underlying action is punchy enough to keep you itching for another few rounds even when repetition sets in.', ""A slide maneuver offers one of the few interesting aspects of Warface's standard run-and-gun formula. Getting a running start, you can drop to the ground instantly to keep your forward momentum, while craning around to blast the kneecaps off unsuspecting foes as you slide by. It's a fun move that gets a lot of play, particularly around tight corners. The ability to lift squadmates up, alley-oop style, onto higher terrain and then get a lift up yourself is another cool maneuver that adds to the flow of battle. In general, combat speeds along at a blistering pace, and stage designs offer lots of diverse nooks and crannies to use for sneaky tactics and gaining the upper hand. While the four classes available aren't original on their own, their strengths and weaknesses are finely tuned for teamwork in a way that makes them a lot more enjoyable to play as part of a squad."", 'Some items are tied to a time restriction, which forces you to buy them again after the clock ticks down.', ""At first glance, the selection of assault, medic, engineer, and sniper classes seems painfully limited, but their interplay in co-op missions reveals greater depth than you might expect. Each of the four classes has a unique primary weapon--an assault rifle, a shotgun, an SMG, and a sniper rifle, respectively--and a secondary pistol and knife for backup. That sets them apart to an extent, but the additional abilities of three of the classes are particularly useful. The assault class, for example, is the only one capable of dropping ammo boxes to resupply your team's dwindling bullet supply. Medics are the only ones who can restore health, and the fact that they can revive fallen teammates is invaluable in tougher missions. Engineers are similarly in demand, given their abilities to plant explosives and apply armor to team members to keep them alive longer. The impact of one team member not doing his or her job properly can be catastrophic to the whole group. This makes the co-op missions both exhilarating and frustrating to plow through."", ""Instead of a cohesive campaign, Warface's co-op missions are one-off affairs that differ from day to day and come in several difficulty tiers. They pit you in multistage runs on a five-person team against droves of enemy AI in more traditional campaign-like stages. High risk and steady challenge make these increasingly punishing gauntlets the most heart-pounding encounters in the game. Once the chopper lands, your crew is on its own. Anyone who dies and isn't revived by a medic in time is stuck on the sidelines as a spectator until someone makes it to the next checkpoint and everyone is revived. This forces your crew to stick together and work as a unit, which is particularly important during brutal encounters with heavy mechs, attack choppers, and armored troops that can mow down a careless squad in one fell swoop. The necessity of teamwork works against you if you can't find the right mix of players to join you, but it also makes for lots of thrills when your group pushes through a crazy stretch in one piece. Warface smartly rewards successful team efforts with bonus experience and spendable points for a job well done."", 'Competitive multiplayer sadly doesn\'t encourage you to make strategic use of the four distinct character classes like the co-op missions do. For example, while speedy medics can revive downed teammates to hamper your opponents\' efforts to score, players assume you\'ll respawn and largely ignore your cries of ""medic!"" to let you bleed out. As a result, your choice of class in versus modes mainly boils down to what kind of gun loadout you prefer. That leads to one of Warface\'s other key disappointments, which is the absolutely shoddy way it handles the free-to-play elements.', 'There\'s a ton of sweet guns and gear to unlock as you level up, but spending either in-game or real-world cash to buy new stuff for your soldiers gives you only temporary use of anything other than your starting weapons. Some premium items are tied to a time restriction, which forces you to buy them again after the clock ticks down, and other weapons get worn out and have to be repaired before you can use them again. For example, you can grab the EXAR-H Crown for a 14 day period if you\'re willing to throw down the astronomical cost of 14,000 crowns, a currency that is earned at an abysmally glacial pace in co-op missions. On the other hand, a different, less pricey gun only lasts a few days before disappearing. One machine-gun I picked up cost a respectable amount of coin, and in the matter of a few quick missions, only 94 percent of its life remained. Spending massive amounts of in-game currency, paid ""kredits,"" or accumulated crowns to have to re-buy or repair a favorite weapon you\'re used to wielding is a real drag. Since in-game currency is earned at such a slow rate, you can sink some serious time into grinding away to buy a rad piece of kit only to wind up losing it after a busy day or two of gunning. This throws a wet blanket on a key aspect of the game.', ""Considering Warface is a sharp-looking game that you can play for free in your Web browser, you might be inclined to overlook some of its minor faults. The collaborative dynamic of co-op missions is the real draw, but the generic presentation and uninspired competitive combat don't take enough risks to push beyond what you've see done before.""]"Kevin VanOrd,7-Nov-13,Path of Exile Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/path-of-exile-review/1900-6415531/,9,PC,"[' ', ""The first leg of the journey is a familiar one: within moments of waking on a lonely beach, you are fending off the lurching undead, receiving only a few words of encouragement to help you find your bearings.

It allows you to discover its world's mysteries without immediately overwhelming you with its complexities. And it all starts with the clicking, as it so often does."", 'Given its initial similarities to the Diablo series, it\'s no surprise that Path of Exile\'s players so frequently compare it to Diablo III, a game they treat with much disdain. This always-online game\'s chat channels are often filled with statements like ""This is the sequel to Diablo II I always wanted,"" and developer Grinding Gear Games clearly looked to Blizzard\'s classic for inspiration: the dark and arcane continent of Wraeclast recalls Sanctuary\'s murkiest regions, and the skeletons and wildlife you encounter in the early hours are much like the foes you manically clicked on years ago.', ""Path of Exile is not a mere retread of Diablo II, however, though it smartly uses this familiarity to instill comfort before introducing you to the diverse mechanics, vaporous dungeons, and wandering phantasms that give the game its unique identity. After you reach Wraeclast's first sign of civilization, quest givers send you into the wilds, where you slaughter goatmen and cannibals as one of six classes. (A seventh class, the scion, unlocks when you first reach the final act's conclusion.) The click-happy action leads you across three increasingly large and intriguing acts. The standard hellions and scavengers that populate Wraeclast's sandy beaches give way to religious temples swarming with floating banners that strike you with deathly bolts of electricity. Path of Exile masterfully builds its world without spending unnecessary time on narrative exposition. Each underground network is more squalid than the last, until you're sure you can smell the stench on your own clothing. You leave behind unremarkable forests in favor of intricate hedge mazes and ramshackle city ruins, and as the world deepens, so too does your investment in it."", 'That\'s not because Path of Exile tells a stupendous story. Magniloquent sentences spill from characters\' mouths, but the stories they convey are less interesting than the lilt of their speech. ""Clarissa pesters me with pity once more,"" says one resident. ""There\'s only so much broth, so many bouquets a man can take."" Such alliteration is more at home in written language than in speech, but it sounds reasonable in Wraeclast, as if the exiles realize that they themselves are this barbarous world\'s only source of tamed culture. This place is much like Dark Souls\' kingdom of Lordran, where I was drawn in not so much by the words the characters said as much as I was by how they said them.', ""Wraeclast's wildness is amplified by multiple mechanics that subvert genre tropes in intelligent ways. You don't collect piles of gold here; there is no use for such extravagances on this callous continent. Instead, you barter with merchants, and indeed, with other players. Scrolls of wisdom, which you use to identify equipment, form the basis of the economy, though players and merchants may require you to give up valuable whetstones if you want an orb that improves a health flask. And like that orb, health itself is a precious commodity that you cannot just purchase from a wandering salesman. Instead, you equip health and mana flasks that fill as you murder your attackers. Like other kinds of equipment, flasks can be modified with orbs that you loot from corpses. Swigging from a flask doesn't just replenish your magical energy; the refreshing liquid may also temporarily add knockback to your melee attacks, or remove bleeding."", 'Electrified golems emit crackling orbs in all directions as your friends sling arrows and knives into their petrified flesh.', ""I see Wraeclast through the eyes of my witch. And she is truly my witch, different from the other witches I encounter in Path of Exile's shared areas. The game provides an astounding number of ways to customize your abilities, starting with skill gems. Your active abilities are not determined by a talent tree but by jewels you insert into slots on your equipment. Both gems and slots are color-coded, and you may only insert a gem into a matching slot. You earn some gems by completing quests, but others appear as loot after a particularly energetic battle, and the game doesn't restrict your choices based on your chosen class. Path of Exile offers an incredible amount of skill flexibility, and showers you with a bounty of treasure."", 'The abundance of loot that clatters to the ground as you slash through a quiver of cobras is continually useful, in part because its value does not rest on its core attributes alone. You must also consider the number of gem slots items contain, as well as the colors of those slots. Some gems support others, causing an ability to last longer, or turning a single fireball into an entire trio of them--but they only function when the support slot is joined to the slot it modifies. A rare robe might seem a remarkable find, but may not allow you to retain your preferred skill composition. The higher you level, the more gems you collect, and the harder the choices you must make become. You can apply certain baubles to your equipment to change the colors of gems, the number of them, and how they are linked, but there is no guarantee that the randomized result will be any more to your liking.', ""One of the earliest gems I found in my travels allowed me to resuscitate corpses as shambling zombies. I could fling fire from my wand and generate a ring of ice, but I soon found myself wanting to play the role of necromancer. Later, I was summoning skeletons from thin air and resurrecting fallen creatures as phantoms, and ultimately could forge a spiritual sentry out of the melee weapons and shimmering armor littering the ground. I scavenged the Imperial Gardens with a 15-member undead entourage, watching my minions tear living statues to pieces while I shot bolts of energy at the most dangerous adversaries. A few glitches occasionally interfered with the fun; I sometimes wasted mana by trying to cast the animate guardian skill on items the spell can't affect, for instance. But I was compelled to push onward at every step, anxious to find an array of gems and armor that fully supported the witch of my dark-fantasy dreams."", ""Many mysteries still await me, even in the savage regions I've already charted."", ""I found myself relying on my fatal flames when my minions were vanquished, particularly when corpses were in short supply. If you rely on certain key skills in this manner, you should approach Path of Exile's extraordinary passive skill tree with thoughtful care. This massive web of passive augmentations is a shock the first time you open it; the entire range of possibilities stretches beyond the confines of the screen, your eyes glazing over due to the sheer magnitude. If you get too experimental with this tree, you could ruin your character, wasting points on skills that don't improve your effectiveness. That's a scary proposition. Common sense is the talent you must rely on here, presuming you don't rush to the Internet to research popular character builds. By the time you reach vital branches in the passive skill tree, you should already have a decent idea of where your path might lead."", ""Perusing the passive skill tree is an intellectual delight when you're hanging around town, preparing for your next adventure. Nevertheless, bloodthirsty combat forms Path of Exile's ironclad foundation, and the moment-to-moment thrills are inescapable, especially if you invite other players to the battleground. It's easy to join up to five others, and should you create a public party, at least a few others are certain to accompany you on your journey. Marching forward as a full party is a visual treat. Electrified golems emit crackling orbs in all directions as your friends sling arrows and knives into their petrified flesh. Multiple marauders hammer on a colossal walker as you conjure an elemental deluge. Some boss fights prove difficult should you face them alone, but fellow exiles are quick to leap to your aid. Sometimes too quick, as it turns out: in a few cases, my powerful teammates quickly slaughtered the opposing general before I had time to blink."", ""It's too bad that Path of Exile's competitive play is so limited. Not only does joining a player-versus-player queue force you to stay in a village, but you can participate only when your level falls within certain bounds. (If you're too high in level, you're out of luck.) Overall, however, you couldn't accuse the game of wanting for content. Various leagues reshape the rules, making bosses more difficult, adding unique items, and implementing permanent death. Other leagues pit players against each other in races, spurring participants to level up as quickly as possible. And even after it seems you've exhausted every possible option, collectible maps give you access to unique adventuring areas with various modifiers applied to them."", ""Considering that Path of Exile costs you nothing beyond some Internet bandwidth, it provides an embarrassment of pleasures. If you like standing out in a crowd, you could toss Grinding Gear Games some cash by purchasing a cosmetic accessory, like a nature aura to surround your wand, or a pet ferret to tail you. I'm so fully committed to Path of Exile that I've spent a bit of coin myself, and my witch is only one of many wayfarers I intend to guide through Wraeclast.

They repeat the same design mistakes they have always made, over and over, with seemingly nothing changing in spite of frequent fan feedback. One such series is Valhalla Knights. After two and a half mediocre-at-best PSP outings and an astonishingly miserable Wii spin-off, the series went quiet for three years, only to return to life like some sort of horrible Frankenstein's monster on the PS Vita. You would think those three years would be put to good use fixing the series' many, many problems for a new generation. Unfortunately, the Frankenstein's monster metaphor is particularly apt here: Valhalla Knights is a lumbering, ugly, patched-together mess. It's made up of some interesting concepts, but the specific parts that compose it are rotten."", 'Valhalla Knights starts off with you creating a central player character. You are part of a team of spies infiltrating the prison city of Carceron, a hive of scum and villainy that has housed numerous scoundrels since it fell from grace during a war many years ago. The setting is one of the few interesting bits of Valhalla Knights 3: a palace transformed into a prison city in the aftermath of a war, with criminal ""families"" warring over territory and a legendary treasure said to rest somewhere deep within its walls.', 'As interesting as the concept is, the execution is thoroughly botched. Many stories have given us lawbreakers and career criminals who nonetheless manage to be appealing and interesting characters, but practically every person in Carceron--aside from the ""service girls"" in various locales--is unappealing at best and detestable at worst. The game also quickly squanders its own setting; the appeal of finding the secrets within a mysterious, cordoned-off prison town dissipates as soon as you step outside into the generic fantasy fields and caves where most of your quests take place.', 'The setting and class system, while great in theory, are attached to a game that is ugly, grind-heavy, laughably animated, and just plain unpleasant on numerous levels.', ""Once you get past the initial batch of tutorials and story (and load times, which are frequent and lengthy), you start digging into the gameplay of Valhalla Knights 3, only to find that it is also wholly unappealing. You start off by creating a character from one of several races and classes, each with its own attributes, stat bonuses, weapons, and skill trees. As you progress through the game, you can swap classes, unlock new races and classes, create and/or hire new party members to join your band under CPU control, and reassign both main classes and subclasses to your crew. The game does an awful job of explaining when and how you can do all of these things, however. At one point early on, I expended a bunch of money to assign my main character a subclass, but then discovered I could do nothing with it because the game hadn't told me that I could learn skills only from a main class."", ""Classes have a direct effect on combat through their specialized weaponry and skills, and no two classes play the same way. While the variety is nice, there's no class or class combination that makes the fighting any more fun. Fighting in Valhalla Knights 3 is akin to that in other action role-playing games: attacks, spells, items, and skills are mapped to certain buttons (or button combinations), and you and your CPU-controlled band try to stay alive while beating down whatever foes are in the way. What becomes clear from the very first battle you enter is how hilariously awful the character and enemy animations are. Hits have little impact, with fighting and hit animations looking abysmal when compared to the sophisticated fighting animations of comparable games. Giving enemies a few soft smacks with a choppy punching combo and watching them topple over dead sucks all the thrill out of a fight. (Cutscenes look just as slapdash, if not more so because you can see the poor character modeling much more clearly.)"", ""Adding to the annoyance are the game's bizarre AI and difficulty fluctuations. You can see enemies wandering the fields, but it's tough to tell when or how they will be aggressive toward you (unless, of course, you initiate combat first). They don't behave in any sort of believable way, either. I encountered instances when I could start a fight, kill some members of a band, run away, and then come back and loot the corpses while the leader was still wandering around, not bothering to strike back even when he saw me again. Also, there's not much of a difficulty curve. You can easily demolish every foe in each area the game leads you to, but the side and story quests that are presented to you in those same areas utterly crush you unless you spend time grinding. The game makes believe you are prepared for the challenge, only to pull the rug out from under you."", 'As if the game weren\'t already embarrassing enough, Valhalla Knights 3 tries to add some spice to the experience by attempting to be ""sexy."" Several of the higher-class stores and facilities in Carceron employ scantily clad, attractive women whom you pay an upfront fee to before you do your regular shopping. Besides buying items and upgrades, you can give presents to the ladies serving you. If they happen to like your gift enough, you enter a Sexy Time minigame where you use the Vita\'s touchscreen to rub the girls\' bodies, stopping every so often to make sure nobody\'s catching you trying to get to first and second base. Succeed, and you go to the Inn in Carceron, and receive potential recruiting and item rewards. Sexy Time is accessed by both male and female main characters, but only female non-player characters can receive your affections; there are a few male NPCs you can give gifts to, but you\'re going to be sorely disappointed if you want equal opportunity Sexy Time. Sexy Time isn\'t fun--it\'s just sleazy and embarrassing.', ""Valhalla Knights 3 is a far cry from being any sort of enjoyable. The setting and class system, while great in theory, are attached to a game that is ugly, grind-heavy, laughably animated, and just plain unpleasant on numerous levels. When you've got a game that lacks an option to alter its obnoxiously slow text speed in favor of numerous options to change some characters' panty patterns, that's a good sign that its priorities aren't in the right place.

It's a goofy premise, since a lot of this fate guiding involves helping a weak-willed zombie find his courage or a knightly couple fall in love."", ""Sadly, the game chooses not to embrace this silliness, and instead gets bogged down in a workaday, good-versus-evil plot culminating in a workaday, good-versus-evil showdown. The fact that you're playing as God is of no real consequence; it's just a flimsy rationale supporting the game's singular purpose: level grinding."", ""The Guided Fate Paradox is a turn-based role-playing game played on a grid. Combat and exploration are not separate modes, so every step your take, or attack you make, counts as a turn. After you act, your partner acts, and then all the enemies act in unison. As you fight, you collect equipment for Renya--aka God--and friends to use, which confers new attacks, spells, or other special abilities. It's a play style reminiscent of the roguelike genre, but with a Japanese RPG twist in character advancement and death."", ""Paradox's woes start with leveling up, which is divided across many systems. By juggling these different systems, Paradox makes you feel as if you're getting stronger, but the complexity of this system also makes it difficult to understand exactly how strong you've become."", ""This is especially vexing when Renya is humming through a dungeon, dropping all challengers with a single blow, and a few floors later wanders into a foe that can do the same thing to him. Finding a happy medium where your abilities are comparable to your foe's is a rarity, which is disappointing since those moments are when Paradox is at its best. They force you to stop and think about the battlefield, and carefully calculate every action."", ""Surmounting one of these encounters is a triumph, but it's short-lived. Renya inevitably outpaces his foes, and then it's back to the mindless slaughter. Some different enemy types would help break up the monotony, but Paradox has only a handful of different foes and none of them are especially interesting to fight. Many simply behave like zombies, wandering aimlessly until they spot you and then relentlessly attacking you until defeated. A handful of boss encounters offer complex challenges, but aside from those endeavors, enemy encounters are simple affairs. One of the most complicated enemies you encounter is a snail with a shield covering its face. The shield blocks all attacks from the front, and the snail follows you around. Besting this devious adversary requires all the trickery and guile of maneuvering someone behind the snail for a flanking attack."", ""A variety of stage gimmicks, including explosive traps and moving platforms, attempt to put a spin on these encounters. However, the enemies and stage gimmicks don't play off each other in interesting ways, unless by total accident. The only constant in Paradox is the grinding: a circular system that rewards grinding with the ability to do more grinding."", ""Not even death can stop the grind. One of the cheapest items in the game lets you escape from any dungeon with all equipment in tow, so there's really no excuse for dying. You can also safeguard your best equipment in a special vault that lets you continue to use it without the fear of losing it upon death. And if the worst should come to pass, you don't have too much to worry about so long as you remember to save your game before entering the dungeon."", 'After you finish the game--a feat that could easily set you back more than 40 hours--something interesting happens. A survival dungeon is unlocked. This dungeon negates all of your base stat advancement, and lets you use only the items recovered in that dungeon. You can improve your characters and their items, just as you would in the rest of the game, but that progression is lost once you leave the dungeon. This goes a long way toward providing a consistent, satisfying challenge. Both Renya and his enemies start at the same level and advance along a similar curve. Play smart, and you can make life easier for yourself by getting ahead of that curve. Alternatively, if you rush through the dungeon the enemies will quickly outpace you.', ""With its intricate leveling system and randomized dungeons, The Guided Fate Paradox succeeds in creating a game that can easily gobble up biblical amounts of time. It's simply too bad all that time spent ends up feeling like a waste when there's no great payoff for all that hard work.""]"Shaun McInnis,5-Nov-13,Call of Duty: Ghosts Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-ghosts-review/1900-6415523/,8,Xbox One & PS3 & Xbox 360 & PS4,"[""The first few minutes of Call of Duty: Ghosts don't paint a terribly accurate portrait of what lies ahead. You barely have time to take stock of the idyllic Southern California setting before fire begins raining down from the heavens, destroying every car and home in sight as a shouty man commands you to follow him to safety. But whereas Infinity Ward's recent work on the Modern Warfare series was weighed down by bewildering plot twists and an affinity for restricting its most exciting moments to noninteractive set dressing, Ghosts tells a lean, straightforward story that throws you into plenty of spectacular situations, but with more breathing room to appreciate the action. Along with the outstanding new Extinction co-op mode and an abundance of clever refinements to competitive multiplayer, Call of Duty: Ghosts is a refreshing and thoroughly satisfying entry in the blockbuster shooter franchise."", ""Much of Ghosts' success stems from its own sense of humility. Infinity Ward has done a great job reining in the excesses of previous Call of Duty campaigns, replacing the crumbling Eiffel Tower and runaway Tube trains of Modern Warfare 3 with a less heavy-handed approach that employs spectacle--and there's no shortage of that here--as more of a complement to its core combat. It's a game that avoids falling in love with its own cinematic ambitions, allowing the ruthless combat and well-paced encounters to take center stage over the plot."", ""It's a good thing, too, because the story is every bit a predictable tribute to American military might. After the collapse of the Middle Eastern oil economy, South America's oil-producing states join together to form an economic and military superpower known as the Federation. Naturally, the Federation decides to hijack a satellite weapon system and turn it against the United States. The conflict that follows is one centered on the Ghosts, an enigmatic tier one task force with a penchant for lethal efficiency and sweet skeleton masks."", 'The whole thing feels like a geopolitical Mad Lib, but a functional and rather harmless one. Ghosts delivers just enough narrative to serve as a catalyst for its whirlwind tour through global warzones, while resisting the urge to club you over the head with plot twists and gratuitous shock-and-awe moments. In many ways, Infinity Ward has crafted a story that reflects the stoic nature of the Ghosts themselves: focused, efficient, and committed to the task at hand.', ""The approach pays off: Ghosts features a terrific collection of shootouts and set pieces, largely unburdened by the sensation that you're merely an extra in someone else's adventure. At various points you go after a missile launch center by tank and an offshore industrial facility by helicopter, each serving as excellent examples of how well Call of Duty's zippy and responsive controls can be applied toward massive, fully navigable battlefields. It's also a game with a knack for crafting tense shootouts in unexpected locales, highlighted by a brief jaunt into outer space that has you floating from one piece of debris to the next, aiming the shots that will make a Federation soldier's helmet decompress in a gruesome hiss."", ""These bombastic set pieces are complemented by more subdued moments, like a deep-sea scuba mission that has you swimming through gorgeous reef formations while avoiding enemies both shark and human. Then there are the more tightly scripted scenes, like prowling through a dense jungle while using a motion tracker to spot enemies, or rappelling down the side of a Caracas skyscraper as you quietly snipe soldiers patrolling its interior. Moments like these further the game's excellent pacing, serving as welcome palette cleansers after some of the more spacious and chaotic battles."", ""It all adds up to a campaign that follows the familiar rhythms of the series, but in a more varied and generous way. There's a real willingness to let you stretch your legs and soak up the spectacle, driven by the feeling that--for the most part--you're the one at the center of the action."", ""There are some missteps. Using your pet dog to take out enemies serves as an entertaining staple of the game's early missions, but this gameplay mechanic completely disappears for the latter half of the campaign. Your AI squad mates still have a habit of occasionally running in front of your gunfire as thought you don't exist, and a few levels follow the bland corridor template a little too closely. But those issues aside, this is an impressive campaign that uses the series' winning formula as more of a roadmap than a shackle."", ""This is an impressive campaign that uses the series' winning formula as more of a roadmap than a shackle."", ""Ghosts is even more impressive on the next-gen hardware of the PlayStation 4. While the current-gen versions are just as competent as ever, rendering the chaotic shootouts at a smooth 60 frames per second, the PS4's next-gen artistry creates a much more immersive battleground. Those effects are most noticeable in the levels that emphasize lighting: the soft bokeh effects of floating embers on a burning oil refinery, or the way moonlight refracts and ripples while underwater. It's essentially the difference between a PC game running on high versus low settings. Each version is functionally the same, but all those extra effects add up to a more engrossing experience."", ""If Ghosts' story campaign is an example of its developers leaving Modern Warfare behind, its approach to co-op takes that trend one step further. Gone are the Spec Ops missions from Infinity Ward's previous work, replaced by a new co-op campaign dubbed Extinction. Much like Zombies in the Black Ops games, Extinction presents a playful alternate reality where you and up to three friends are dropped into a battle against fantastical enemies. But instead of shambling zombies, you're fighting a swarm of buglike aliens. The way these enemies scurry up the sides of buildings and burst forth from underground hives changes the dynamic in a monumental way: you're still employing Call of Duty's signature shooting mechanics, but you're doing so against an enemy whose animalistic movement makes it much more imposing and unpredictable than your average foot soldier."", ""Extinction is an ambitious hybrid of tower defense, Left 4 Dead, and Borderlands. You're drilling into alien hives as you move through the backwoods and small-town streets of rural America, each drill site its own standoff against swarms of incoming enemies who grow larger and nastier as the campaign progresses. There's a class system that allows you to play complementary roles, an in-game skill tree that lets you beef up your character on the fly, and a scavenging system where taking the time to rummage through a dumpster might reward you with a new weapon sight. There's also an economy that encourages fun twists on teamwork, like the ability to pool your money together to unlock a helicopter strike when things get really tough."", ' ', ""None of these ideas are remarkable on their own, but the way Extinction blends them with Call of Duty's fast-paced action is tremendous fun. Throwing a hypno knife at an acid-flinging scorpion to turn it into a friendly, debating whether to buy a turret gun for yourself or a crate of incendiary ammo for your team--Extinction is full of all these little moments and decisions that add up to a stellar co-op experience. This is Call of Duty venturing as far outside its comfort zone as it ever has, but the payoff is immense."", ""A more familiar experience can be found in Ghosts' competitive multiplayer. The frantic pacing and close-quarters encounters are every bit as enjoyable as they've ever been, augmented by contextual lean and running slide abilities that make for more fluid transitions in and out of cover. Infinity Ward has taken a delicate approach to the existing multiplayer progression, though a new perk weighting system promotes better player balance while still giving you plenty of ways to micromanage your loadouts."", ""One of the features that Ghosts introduces to multiplayer is a character customization system that takes those abstract player levels and wraps a greater sense of ownership around them. You can now create a roster of personalized soldiers, each decked out in a wardrobe full of custom armor and equipment. Facial designs, skin color, and gender are all options you can use to craft your own characters, and then you take those creations one step further by leveling them all up independently of one another. For a series that has long given you such granular control over your weapons and abilities, it's nice to finally be able to apply that same level of personalization to the characters themselves."", ""That customization system is what drives the new Squads mode, a feature that pushes Call of Duty eerily close to the realm of management sim. Squads is where you take your custom characters and turn them into a full-blown team of AI soldiers, leading your creations in competitive matches against teams designed by your friends--even if those friends happen to be offline. It essentially spreads the rewards of repeated prestiging out across different soldiers, giving dedicated players a new kind of progression for the countless hours they will spend leveling up. Squads is clearly a feature designed for the most hardcore Call of Duty players, but it's also a testament to just how deep the well of competitive experiences has become."", ""Yet Squads is hardly the only addition to Call of Duty's competitive landscape. Ghosts introduces a number of clever multiplayer modes that keep a keen eye on the series' strengths while taking a playful approach to how you can interact with one another. Blitz is like a twist on American football: players dash toward scoring zones on the other team's side of the map, warping right back to safety if they're successful and becoming sitting ducks if they fail to properly judge the scoring cooldown timer. Hunted takes a Hunger Games approach to multiplayer design, giving players one handgun and 10 bullets to start and forcing them to fight over randomized weapon drops that fall from the sky. And then there's Grind, an evolution of Kill Confirmed that makes players take the dog tags dropped by fallen enemies and run them back to a handful of specific locations in order to bank points. Each of these game modes adds a devilish new wrinkle to the multiplayer experience, taking an already exceptional collection of competitive options and expanding them further."", ""From an exuberant campaign full of spectacle and variety to the way Extinction's unpredictable aliens force you to use those targeting skills in entirely new ways, Ghosts strikes an excellent balance between the familiar and the novel. This is a game that's keenly aware of the series' strengths, but doesn't find itself beholden to them. No matter what standard you apply, Call of Duty: Ghosts is a terrific first-person shooter.""]"Chris Barylick,4-Nov-13,Angry Birds Star Wars Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/angry-birds-star-wars-review/1900-6415525/,6,PS3,"['My Luke Skywalker Angry Bird has crossed the blazing sands of Tatooine, survived the icy plains of Hoth, trained with Yoda in the swamps of Dagobah, fought Boba Fett in Cloud City, and is ready to take down Pig Vader in the final levels of the second Death Star. With a little luck, the right trajectory, and the boosted Force powers I picked up several levels ago, he might just make it.', 'Angry Birds Star Wars has moved beyond its traditional mobile operating system roots. After four years of dominating iOS and Android sales, the franchise has spun off, in Star Wars form, to current-generation consoles. The game re-creates the original Star Wars trilogy in Angry Birds form and retells the story of Luke Skywalker, complete with the birds as the Rebel Alliance and the pigs as the Empire, in an amusing adaptation of the trilogy.', ""As in the Angry Birds you know and love, the goal of each level is to hurl your bird at the pigs, using whatever terrain, explosives, or unique features might be available to wipe them out. All of this is presented in the classic Angry Birds tongue-in-cheek style. Colorful visuals recreate beloved Star Wars scenes with a sly wink, and provide a wonderful complement to the birds' and pigs' grumblings at the start of each level. Birds shriek as they're launched into the air and land with a thud or crash, and their cries of victory when you complete the level are a charming reward for a job well done. Conversely, should you fail the level, the pigs' mocking chortles--and the half-demonic laughter of Pig Vader in particular--inspire you to try a new strategy."", ""Angry Birds has always combined elements of luck, strategy, and chaos; upon launching your bird, you work with whatever variables--such as gravity, TNT, air vents, or weighted objects--complicate the level. Just as in the mobile Angry Birds games, a responsive set of controls makes it easy to pull back the slingshot, find the right angle, and send your bird soaring into the fray. It's consistently enjoyable to try random new ideas within a level before stumbling upon a tactic that works and earns you two or three stars upon demolishing the last piggy. It's best to stick with a standard controller, for what it's worth. If you use the Move controller, you get a wider default view, but don't get access to the widest view available, which makes for cumbersome navigation."", ""There's nothing quite like flinging your Luke Skywalker bird by the head of an AT-AT walker, cleanly cutting that head off with a light saber, and then watching the head roll down a hill to reign utter chaos among your porcine foes."", 'Where Star Wars would be nothing without the Force, Angry Birds Star Wars would be nothing without an upgradable set of unique and Force-related abilities for your birds. Your Luke Skywalker bird can swing a light saber in midair, your Han Solo bird can fire a trio of laser bolts at any target along its trajectory, and your Obi-Wan Kenobi bird can use a Force push to shove objects in midair--as well as through walls--or deflect laser blasts. Not to be outdone, your Princess Leia bird can grab objects with a miniature tractor beam and fling them about as needed, your Chewbacca bird can crash through almost any object, and your Rebel pilot bird can split into three small, fast-moving birds. These powers round out the Star Wars element and make it fun to enter a new level, look over the puzzle at hand, take a mental inventory of what birds you have at your disposal, and begin racking your brain as to the steps you have to take to beat the level. You also upgrade your birds after you complete the requisite number of levels, which only improves the pig-smashing fun.', ""The Star Wars element isn't merely a veneer: the levels embrace the locations from the movies as well as the source material itself. The inventive level design keeps you on your toes, and it's interesting to see the physics change based on location. The Cloud City and space-based levels introduce variable gravity and varying air paths you must fling your bird over, and these shifts keep the gameplay lively. There's nothing quite like flinging your Luke Skywalker bird by the head of an AT-AT walker, cleanly cutting that head off with a light saber, and then watching the head roll down a hill to reign utter chaos among your porcine foes."", ""When your birds' powers just aren't enough, the Millennium Falcon has been transformed into the Mighty Falcon, wherein a probe can be flung toward your opponents and set off, and the Millennium Falcon scorches the general area with laser fire. You have to save up the stars you collect by beating each level to use the Mighty Falcon, but it's fun to call in a laser-based air strike when you want to wipe out a few holdout enemies."", ""While Star Wars Angry Birds' single-player mode pulls out all the stops, the multiplayer mode is bland by comparison. Two players can fling birds cooperatively or compete for high scores, but either way, Angry Birds Star Wars makes for a lackluster shared experience. It's a shame these modes play so closely to the traditional Angry Birds structure, rather than bring something novel to the mix. As it is, taking turns with a friend doesn't bring anything meaningful to Angry Birds that you couldn't experience on your own, even in the game's mobile versions."", ""And that's where things get sticky. All of this content is available for under $10 in total on mobile platforms, yet runs a hefty $39.99 on console. Granted, Angry Birds Star Wars arrives with a hefty amount of content--about 100 levels to play through, some cool bonus levels, and character stickers and concept art to unlock--but that's a huge premium to pay for the luxury of playing Angry Birds on your television screen."", ""It's hard to overcome the price point, as charming as Angry Birds Star Wars is. The difference in price between platforms is substantial, but the difference in gameplay is not. Yet you shouldn't outright sentence Angry Birds Star Wars to the Great Pit of Carkoon to be slowly digested over the course of 1,000 years. The game's midi-chlorian counts may not be through the roof, but not every bird needs to be a Jedi Master to have value in this galaxy.""]"Brett Todd,4-Nov-13,The Harvest Review - GameSpot,http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-harvest-review/1900-6415524/,3,PC,"[""The campaign in The Harvest takes about three hours to complete, and that's way too much time to spend with this action-heavy role-playing game."", 'The Harvest takes the usual Diablo-esque hack-and-slash tropes and moves them to a sci-fi world of blasters and robots. Granted, this is a premise with promise. Developer Luma Arcade gets a couple of brownie points for doing something outside of the Tolkien-derived comfort zone of action role-players. I was excited in the beginning about the five futuristic character classes, including space marine wannabes, dual-blade assassins with cloaking devices, and robots that are followed around by heavily armed battle drones.', ""The minor thrill wears off fast once the game gets under way, however. First, the story is nigh on incomprehensible, and the quality of the graphic-novel-style cutscenes introducing everything is abysmal. Future Earth seems to be under siege by enemy aliens, or robots, or some weird cross between the two, and they're looking to harvest souls, grain, or maybe the endless supply of Cheetos. You're called upon by a quasi-military body of men and women in big hats to save the day by killing these bad guys, which take the form of just a handful of creatures, most notably small robot spiders, midsize robot spiders, giant robot spiders, and guys with guns or blades."", ""The action is tedium itself. Combat consists of the usual clicking, with little variation beyond one or two canned attacks. You use either your main gun or blade, or one of each character's three special abilities. With the scarab space marine, for example, I did nothing but mindlessly chip away at enemies with a blaster or cause greater damage by leaping into the air and shaking things up with explosive landings. The game isn't challenging on the default difficulty setting, as long as you keep an eye on your health and energy levels, which keep you upright and dealing out special attacks, respectively."", ""The only strategic consideration is not being able to boost your HP at will through the game's med-pack take on health potions. Whenever you hit the med-pack button on the main screen, it starts a recharge timer that must tick down before you can go for another round. Since this takes a little while, you generally can't buff your HP more than once during a battle. This does add a slight tactical dimension to combat, especially with bosses and large numbers of foes."", 'Levels are huge, sprawling affairs that take ages to trudge through.', ""Loot drops are always disappointing. Slain enemies sometimes spit up goodies like helmets, armor, and weapons, but loot doesn't appear as often as you'd hope, and does little to buff your abilities. Armor items come in various flavors of metal, while the weapons have exotic-car monikers (I think I test-drove a VX-7 Tarantula once). You level up frequently, which lets you boost the three core scores--strength, endurance, and agility--but that's it. This is remedial role playing in a Technicolor world."", ""There isn't even much to buy. You earn potion bottles that come with various point values and can be used to purchase gear, as well as to buy instant respawns at the point of death so that you don't just beam back to the most recent checkpoint. Yet actual choice is limited; items change up seemingly at random, and what is available is typically so expensive that you can't afford it until well into the game. The in-game marketplace has also been so fully automated that you can magically buy and sell from the character menu screen at any time."", ""Levels are huge, sprawling affairs that take ages to trudge through. Some are outside in desert terrain, and others are in indoor sci-fi lab facilities, but all are bland and nearly featureless. You notice the odd bit of kit like monitor screens and chests you can blow apart for the gifts inside, but there just isn't anything that interesting, and one real letdown is how character appearance changes so little with the addition of new gear. There isn't much of anything worth taking the time to look at. Or do. Outside of killing enemies, tasks never amount to more than annoying busywork where you run down one corridor or another to activate or destroy some sort of device. All of these jobs drag out the campaign unnecessarily."", 'Multiplayer only proves that misery doesn\'t always love company. It lets you experience the same brief, irritating campaign with others, but trying to join public games almost always results in a ""No suitable public game rooms could be found"" message, making it impossible to tell whether online play is broken or no one is actually playing.', 'Somebody will no doubt someday make a good sci-fi Diablo. But The Harvest is definitely not that game.

It's an odd but enduring mix, one that's given us Charmy Bee cameos in a stylised re-creation of England's capital city for London 2012, but sadly the mascot duo's fourth outing falls flat."", ""In Mario & Sonic's first outing on the Wii U, developer Sega starts with a major change for the series: Mario & Sonic at the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games demands that you make use of the Wii MotionPlus across its collection of 20 Nintendo and Sega characters and 25-odd minigames. The hardware boost ensures an extra degree of controller fidelity in new and returning Olympic events including skiing, figure skating, and curling. And while the move creates an additional expense for families with only a few regular Wii Remotes kicking around, the MotionPlus helps bring a touch of finesse to a previously waggle-intensive series."", ""It's the forced addition of the GamePad that serves to complicate matters, shifting the series away from its simplistic roots. At best you've just got to explain each individual mechanic to a group all holding different configurations of controllers, but at worst you've got to contend with groups of irate children arguing over why one gets to have a GamePad and the others don't."", ""The GamePad is incorporated in various ways, and like with many aspects of the Mario & Sonic series, there are both ups and downs. Biathlon, a new event for 2014, mixes cross-country skiing on the Wii Remote with a shooting range, letting the player at the top of the pack shoot via the GamePad while forcing others to use the more complicated Wii Remote. It's a sporting event that hasn't been well translated into a party game, suffering too much from the fact that it's the person who's already ahead that gets placed in the most advantageous situation."", ""Bobsleigh is another example of an event that's complicated by the GamePad's involvement, only one that's far more endearingly preposterous. The leader steers the vehicle with the GamePad while barking orders at up to three other players, who lean their Wii Remotes to the left or right to help steer around corners. Sitting cross-legged in a row on the floor isn't required, but it does make this event a lot more fun."", ""Snowboard slopestyle, meanwhile, has you take turns to get the highest score on a downhill run, with points awarded for speed, jumps, and grinds. You steer with the GamePad, and flick the touchscreen to perform tricks. It's simple but fun, and is pleasantly different from the more traditional downhill skiing."", ""Many returning events are identical to their previous incarnations, though some have been spruced up a bit. Hockey, a particularly drab addition in Mario & Sonic's last wintry sojourn, fills in the hole left by the absence of soccer and beach volleyball, now functioning as a kind of cut-down NHL that has you darting around a tiny rink making chaotic overpowered shots while a Shy Guy sits in goal at each end. It's a lot more fun than you'd expect from such a rudimentary implementation, but it's also hard to imagine it being something you'd want to play multiple times. "", ""Figure skating pairs easily takes the crown for the barmiest minigame. Two players are judged on synchronising their movements, and while you're each allowed to hold a Wii Remote, it's when you play together by holding hands around a single controller that the real silliness kicks in. Having one player clumsily spin around the other in real life while an onscreen Daisy pirouettes elegantly around Dr Eggman is enough to put a smile on anyone's face, although you might need to encourage your immediate friends and family members to finish a glass of wine before joining in."", ""There are highlights, then, but too many events prove to be a disappointment. I've always found it particularly difficult to feel anything but boredom for this series' ski jumping and speed skating modes, and the downhill slide offered by skeleton is handled with more panache by skiing and snowboarding. But it's Sochi 2014's Dream Events that are especially lacking, with the series' former fantastical twists now reduced to half-baked spins of preexisting events wrapped loosely in the aesthetics of the Sonic or Mario series. Snowball scrimmage is the worst of the lot; it's a crude third-person two-versus-two battle with flat snowball-firing guns."", 'The Mario & Sonic series has been an inclusive experience, catering to all players of all skill levels, but Sochi 2014 complicates that simplicity.', ""Developer Sega attempts to add value with a flurry of other modes, with Legends Showdown acting as the game's campaign. As opposed to the technically involved London Party board game of London 2012, Legends Showdown simply peppers a cluster of events with the odd cutscene, as a quartet of characters face off against shadow versions of themselves. Each area is capped off with a boss battle against one of the Sonic or Mario series' more obscure characters, including E-102 Gamma, Birdo, and Jet the Hawk. The mode is completely dull."", ""Medley Mania is similar to Legends Showdown, but presents clusters of events without any narrative context, and Action & Answer Tour mixes individual events with a quiz show . You must complete various feats during randomised events, such as exposing a picture hidden in smoke with curling stones. It's the most successful additional mode in the game by a country mile, forcing you to keep a little something extra buzzing around your head while competing."", 'The game also adds online competition to the series for the first time, but only via four events: Olympic events freestyle ski cross, snowboard cross, and short track speed skating, alongside multi-vehicle Dream Event winter sports champion race. You can be matched into games alongside strangers or people from your friends list, and online multiplayer is tied together with a national metagame. Winning points in an event goes towards a ranking for your country, with the game displaying the national rankings on the main screen and also via in-game updates on the GamePad.', ""The Mario & Sonic series has been an inclusive experience, catering to all players of all skill levels, but Sochi 2014 complicates that simplicity. The game's long-winded tutorials have a wearying effect, and the most enjoyable events--which are the simplest, coincidentally--are essentially identical to events from previous years. There are dribs of fun to be extracted from the overall package, but from the outset, it's hard to shake the feeling that this is a series that has now thoroughly outstayed its welcome."", ""The Mario & Sonic series is the perfect example of the kind of charming, bite-sized, and all-inclusive entertainment that defined Nintendo throughout the Wii's golden years, but a lack of creativity and a poor implementation of the Wii U GamePad ensure that Mario & Sonic's fourth outing in six years fails to secure a podium finish.""]"
