0,Halo: Spartan Strike,21-Apr-15,Dave Rudden,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/21/halo-spartan-strike-review,"[""Halo has plenty of elements that don't work within the framework of a top-down shooter; it's pretty much impossible to be cinematic from a bird's eye view, and the absence of a vertical plane removes much of the combat's nuance. Fortunately, the few elements that do work are Halo: Spartan Strike's strong suit. The variety of weaponry, skills, and enemies culled from Halo's 13-year history add enough variety to keep the campaign afloat, while the series lore contributes the modicum of narrative drive necessary to keep up the storytelling side."", ""Like 2013's Halo: Spartan Assault, Spartan Strike takes place within a tactical simulator, using fictional combat situations to train soldiers. While I was initially irked by Spartan Strike's non-canon status, it uses this what if scenario to really open up some combat diversity, it just takes a little time getting there."", ""The first few levels of Spartan Strike seem almost like a post-patch Spartan Assault. Besides an improved reticule system that makes aiming a tad easier, I was using most of the same weapons to mow down most of the same enemies,though the stages aren't as one-note as they were before. At around the halfway mark though, Spartan Strike gets really interesting with the incorporation of Halo 4's Promethian enemies and weapons."", ""In particular, the Watchers add a nice twist with their ability to revive Spartan Strike's two toughest enemies: Knights and Promethian turrets. Due to ammo limitations, Spartan Strike already encourages a more tactical-top down action experience than most typical twin-stick arcade-style shooters, but having to reassess an otherwise benign enemy that revives the heaviest hitters made for some of my favorite sequences; particularly when I had to manage another element like an NPC to guard or a gate to slowly open."", ""There's also a few great combat options you can pluck from those Promethian corpses, including the scattershot gun and the shock chain ability that makes some of the late-game onslaughts a bit easier to tackle. There's a bit of repetition between human, Covenant, and Promethian weaponry (a fact thats tougher to bear when they're millimeters apart on the ground and represented by tiny icons) but having the majority of Halo's artillery at my disposal was worth it. Having the straightforward UNSC pistol and dual semi-automatics, the Convenant's more complex Needler, and the Promethian's powerful-yet-slow incineration cannon available on the same level allowed for more combat variety than I've seen in most twin-stick shooters. The new UNSC Kestrel floating ship (which was intended for but cut from Halo 2) provides a bit more firepower than the Warthog with a tad less speed."", ' ', 'One element I wish had been given a bit more attention in Spartan Strike is the combat-modifying Skulls. The six that were in Spartan Assault went a long way toward spicing up the combat, giving more points for trying unique things like turning off the HUD or needing melee kills to restore shield power. Spartan Strike has the same exact six, and and between that and the loss of online co-op, which added some replay value to the console versions of Spartan Assault, Spartan Strike isnt quite as replayable - though at half the price and no microtransactions, its still a better value.', ""There are 20 stages in Spartan Strike's core campaign, which can be completed in roughly four hours. There's five more bonus stages which can only be unlocked if you hit the gold medal score threshold. The key to getting high scores? Using boosters you buy with XP that those Skulls are necessary for. It seems like a sad vestige of Spartan Assault's awful microtransaction system, which Im glad to see gone. I'd honestly rather grind and replay a five minute stage two or three times than have to shell out money to buy the best boosters."", 'Of the versions available, PC is the best choice, as it\'s the only platform that allows the use of a controller, with the mouse-keyboard setup offering an option for those who want quicker aiming. Surprisingly, the twin-stick style holds up on iOS and Windows 8 touch-screen for the most part, though there were a few instances where my left thumb moved off the screen and my Spartan stopped dead in its tracks. The ""drag on the right side of the screen to shoot"" system is a bit unwieldy at first, but it eventually became second nature after a few of the easier early stages. The major exception was the Covenant plasma pistol, as its unique charging ability was tough to pull off without a button to hold down. Fortunately, it\'s far from Spartan Strike\'s best weapon.']",IGN
1,The Evil Within: The Consequence,23-Apr-15,Lucy O'Brien,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/23/the-evil-within-the-consequence-review,"[""A direct continuation of The Evil Withins superb first story DLC The Assignment, The Consequence is torn between wrapping up a complicated story and delivering a stylish stealth experience. Thanks to gorgeous environmental design and great boss battles it's still a compelling experience, but it's also a disjointed one."", ""As protagonist Juli Kidman is propelled by malevolent forces toward her fate, the team at Tango Gameworks have clearly rushed to tie up the first installment's loose ends. I continue to appreciate The Evil Withins nutty psychological horror concept for what it is, but ghostly real-time flashbacks and encounters with Julis ominous boss are too frequent here, taking on an air of insistent - and lifeless - pantomime."", '\n', 'Their constant interruptions break up the tight stealth gameplay that was such a highlight in The Assignment. While Julis still without a weapon for most - but not all - of her journey, The Consequence struggles to maintain an air of tension while moving the story forward, and enemies, poised on precipices for a pre-determined shove or thrown carelessly beyond the obvious route, feel like an afterthought.', 'More problematically, The Consequence struggles to know what to do with its Big Bad, Ruvik. Now something of an overexposed figure, his all-seeing presence is mostly relegated to the clunky abstract in The Consequence, and one miserable sequence saw me lighting paintings of his face on fire in order to break his demonic hold.', 'There is a fun to be had once Tango throws up its hands and gives Juli a gun later on in proceedings. Shes only a little stronger with a weapon in her hand - unlike The Evil Withins tougher Sebastian, she is killed in two hits - so every bullet counts. A stealthy approach might have been more interesting, but its hard to deny the satisfaction of downing five enemies with five bullets in the chamber.', 'And fortunately, originality blooms elsewhere. The Consequence has some of the creepiest environments in The Evil Within to date; the series trademark askew camera angles and ghostly filters complement body-horror walls and narrow corridors. Tango has always enjoyed messing with time and space, and here its set-pieces shift in wonderfully bizarre - and disorientating - ways.  Of particular note are its boss battle arenas, which pulled the rug from under my feet so frequently I felt genuinely panicked; which is, of course, the point.', 'It doesnt hurt that these bosses are truly unnerving creations. Tango continues to be happy tapping into horror cinema - more specifically, Adrian Lynes hugely influential Jacobs Ladder - and has riffed on the familiar to create new frights. While the terrifying lamp lady returns here with style, one boss - in the throes of Lynes judder effect - spooked me in a way no video game nasty has before or since.']",IGN
2,State of Decay: Year One Survival Edition,22-Apr-15,Ryan McCaffrey,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/22/state-of-decay-year-one-survival-edition-review,"['When I reviewed State of Decay on Xbox 360 on June 5, 2013, I gave it an 8.9  the highest end of great on our scale without graduating to amazing. Heres how I summed it up then:', '""State of Decays ambition reaches farther than most $60 titles, so its value is unquestionable as a $20 download  especially given how it manages to successfully meet so many of its lofty goals. I spent about 12 hours in this Zed-infested world, and while I saw most of whats there, I couldve spent a few more hours exploring. And since I focused on melee weapons the first time, I fully plan to start another game with a gun-centric character...Decay belongs in the pantheon of great modern zombie games alongside Valves Left 4 Dead series and Telltales Walking Dead episodes.""', '', 'Coming back to it on the Xbox One for the Year One Survival Edition, I realized Id forgotten how much I love State of Decay. Its deep, raw, unforgiving, and even emotional -- all in the very best of ways. Its neither a pure action game nor your typical open-world action-adventure. It is, in fact, a systems-based role-playing game with permanent (and sometimes far-reaching) consequences for your characters. Youll need to manage: relationships with fellow survivors, your groups resources, injuries to you and your group, your backpack weight, your influence, your fatigue, and more. That may sound like an intimidating list, but through an easily understood and managed interface (press up on the D-pad to access it anytime), Decays elements are intuitive and digestible.', 'Year One Survival Edition also bundles in State of Decays two excellent expansion packs: Breakdown and Lifeline. Each tells a side story with a different gameplay angle: the former being a sandbox-emphasizing, challenge-oriented romp, and the latter letting you play from the perspective of the military -- a group at odds with the player in the primary campaign. Each is clearly meant to be played after you complete the main game, but its refreshing that neither is simply more of the same.', ' ', 'Unfortunately, being re-released on a more powerful console has not cured its technical and presentation-based ills like Id hoped (and reasonably expected) it would. Clipping bugs, warping characters, and frame rate problems all still plague State of Decay on Xbox One. Even running in 1080p with higher-resolution textures and a few other minor cosmetic upgrades, Year One Survival Edition still very much looks like an Xbox 360 game. At least the annoying screen tearing has been rectified.', 'But, please, do not judge this book by its cover. Everything I said in my original review still rings true: This is a special game, and captures the post-zombie-outbreak survival experience Ive always wanted to play. Is it worth double-dipping if you already played the heck out of it on 360? If you havent played the expansion packs, Id say yes -- particularly when existing State of Decay owners get $10 off YOSEs $30 asking price. If youve already squeezed every last drop of fun out of this game on 360 or PC, though, the additions here are minimal.']",IGN
3,Crypt of the Necrodancer,21-Apr-15,Cam Shea,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/21/crypt-of-the-necrodancer-review,"['Crypt of the NecroDancer has one of the most ingenious game design twists Ive come across in some time. This dungeon-crawlers gameplay is fundamentally tied to its music. You move on the beat, and so too do your enemies, making every encounter an elaborate dance. Get the steps right and its a thing of beauty.', 'Of course, being a roguelike, the penalties for getting them wrong can be severe, and you can very quickly find yourself starting again. The beauty of Crypt of the NecroDancers central concept, however, is that every run is essentially a series of puzzles to be solved. Sure, theres plenty of randomness, and theres no denying that picking up a bad-ass weapon, some armour, a sweet charm and some health-restoring food can make a journey into the NecroDancers lair a whole lot easier, but theres predictability within the randomness: enemy movements follow the same rules each time, so defeating them is all about knowing the steps.', '\n', 'Youre actually doing more of a nervous jig than a dance as you hop from tile to tile, puzzle solving to the beat. As the music plays your enemies come ever closer, forcing you to find and exploit an opening before its too late. The rules of engagement are pretty simple. If you and an enemy both try and hop onto the same tile on the same beat youll take damage. Instead, you want to move so youre adjacent to an enemy, which then lets you attack. Youll only take damage if the enemy then tries to jump into your tile and doesnt die from your attack.', ""Its pretty cool working out how to outmanoeuvre NecroDancer's varied bestiary. The dirt walls within each dungeon can be dug out, for instance, which is great from an exploration/discovery perspective, but it also enables you to dig buffer  to dig a dirt tile out and thus stay stationary for a beat. Need to let an enemy jump one tile closer while you stay in the same spot? This is the way to do that without losing your coin multiplier."", 'The gameplay, then, is entirely geared around manipulating enemy movement patterns so that you can safely attack. This might be about knowing that an enemy jumps forward one square every four beats, which enables you to jump in and attack twice before jumping away and having it follow so you then have three more beats to finish it off.', '', 'Monkeys move on every beat, while red dragons can one-shot you from across the screen.', 'Each failed run teaches you more about how each enemy moves, which then  hopefully  makes it easier to execute your dance of death next time. Cleverly, though, Crypt of the NecroDancers randomly generated dungeons never let you get too complacent. The music changes with each floor you descend within a zone, for instance, forcing you to adjust to a new tempo. Each of the four zones also has its own set of enemies and its own gameplay tweaks, and ends in a randomly chosen boss fight, making it its own distinct challenge.', 'Every level in Zone 3, for instance, is divided into fire and ice sections, with music that shifts in tone depending on which one youre in. There are ice creatures that leave behind frozen tiles which you slip across, adding another wrinkle to kiting enemies correctly, while the lava tiles that appear in the wake of fire monsters will deal damage if you walk on more than one in a row. Ice tiles can also be melted to create water tiles, which are their own obstacle.', 'Zone 4, on the other hand, sees the digging mechanic change so that its multiple tiles at a time, changing how buffering works but also allowing the player to knock down the scarabs that perch atop walls. Here you also have enemies that parry attacks, drop live bombs when defeated and teleport the player.', 'Each zone, then, requires its own approach and knowledge-base, but even when youve got something of a handle on enemy movement patterns, Crypt of the NecroDancer still offers up a good challenge. No two games will ever be the same, and when the soundtrack is bumping along and you have to quickly appraise a room and execute a sequence with multiple enemies all moving to their own beat, its all too easy to mess up.', '', 'The fire and ice theme is great - particularly its impact on the soundtrack.', 'The right loot can really help, and can also drastically change the feel of the gameplay. Broadswords can do damage to adjacent tiles for instance, whereas the crossbow can fire up to four tiles ahead, but needs to be reloaded  on the beat. You can also expand your viewing range with torches, upgrade your shovel so it can dig through tougher walls, put on armour to raise your base defence stats, eat food to restore health, pick up a wide variety of spells, expand your health or carrying capacity, wear a number of charms and crowns, find dungeon maps and so on.', 'And of course, youre deciding what to pick up and what to buy while hopping back and forth, adding somewhat comical pressure to even the act of gearing up. Is an obsidian rapier better than a golden whip? Is it worth swapping my pick-axe for a glass shovel given it will shatter when I take damage? Is the Ring of Charisma better than the Ring of Luck?', 'There are just so many variables here, and like most roguelikes youre always in search of that dream run, where you get helpful gear that makes pushing through the area youre in more straightforward. Its entirely possible to get by with just the dagger, but what a difference a bit of reach and some armour makes. After all, death can come very very swiftly in Crypt of the NecroDancer. All it really takes is getting a single strong enemys attack pattern wrong and youre dead. And starting all over again. Well, mostly.', 'NecroDancer does have a meta game, where you spend diamonds earned during runs on gear that directly upgrades you  like extra starting life  or on items that will then appear within the game. It helps keep the game evolving, but unlike a game like Rogue Legacy  where you have a long road of small incremental upgrades to make over the course of the game that gradually improve your chances - youll run out of things to spend your diamonds on before too long here.', '', 'Zone 4 is pure chaos.', 'Thats a little disappointing given diamonds are a core collectable, but it does make sense given NecroDancers overall design philosophy. This game, after all, is driven by the pursuit of tactical metronomic movement, and its longevity comes from twisting the core gameplay with the many unlockable characters.', 'Theres the Monk, for instance, who is killed instantly if he picks up gold, but can choose one free item from the merchant each time he appears. Theres the pacifist, Dove, who doesnt kill enemies  just confuses them with the flower she wields  and for whom the exits are always unlocked and there are no boss battles. Theres Eli, who takes a page out of Bombermans book, with no weapons, just infinite bombs, which he can kick at enemies. And then theres Melody, who wields a golden lute, which only does damage when shes adjacent to enemies, demanding a completely different approach to combat.', 'With ten playable characters in all, each offers up quite a unique challenge. The one Ive spent the most time using other than Cadence  the starter character  is actually the Bard, as he effectively makes the game turn-based. Global movement remains tied to the beat, but you no longer have to move in time with the backing track. What that means is that the music plays as per normal, but if youre not moving, the gameworld is effectively frozen. Move a tile and everything moves forward a step. Hop through the map at pace and everything else moves in fast motion. Its a cool twist because it means you can puzzle out how to defeat each level without the time pressure of having to move on every actual beat. It makes you a puppet master, in other words. And yet I still die... over and over.', 'Theres more here too. Mod support is baked right in. Theres a level editor. The final game has three versions of the soundtrack to switch between  and you can set the soundtrack on a character by character basis. Not only that, but you can allocate your own music as the soundtrack, which is every bit as cool as it sounds. You can play local co-op with a friend, you can take on a daily challenge, you can practice against every enemy and every boss using every weapon. Oh, and hey, you want to literally dance your way through the game? Theres an easier mode for anyone with a dance mat.', '', ""Bosses riff on the dancing theme, and aren't overly punishing.""]",IGN
4,I Am Bread,13-Apr-15,Mikel Reparaz,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/13/i-am-bread-review,"[""As I nudge a slice of bread away from its loaf, it pushes open the door of the medicine cabinet where someone inexplicably placed it, revealing a vast, untidy bathroom. If my slice can somehow reach the hairdryer on the other side of the room, it'll be able to toast itself to perfection. It shouldnt be possible, but the slice flops forward, gripping the cabinet door with one of its corners. Slowly I swing it upward, grab the door with a different corner, and repeat the motion until the slice reaches the top of the cabinet  which turns out to be surrounded by mildew. As the bread's edibility rapidly diminishes, I reflexively lurch it away, only to watch helplessly as it plummets toward the watery floor and soggy doom. It's moments like this that typify I Am Bread: awkward, frustrating, and a little exhausting, but with just enough bizarre charm to justify another try."", 'I Am Bread has a story, surprisingly, but all that really matters is your bread slice\'s single-minded drive to toast itself by whatever improvised means are available. Like Bossa Studios\' other hilariously clumsy physics puzzler, Surgeon Simulator 2013, much of I Am Bread\'s challenge lies in simply coming to grips with its purposely awkward grab-and-flop controls. Each corner of your slice corresponds to a different key or shoulder button (theres controller support), which makes them grab whatever they\'re touching, creating an axis from which you can flip or fling your slice. Touch the floor or some other filthy surface, and your slice\'s health  or ""edibility""  drops (along with your final score) until you can swing to safety. And when you need to climb, make it quick; your bread can cling to anything, but it can only do so for as long as its grip meter holds out.', ""It's difficult, but not impenetrable. Like anything else, manipulating your toast-to-be gets easier with practice, and toward the end of I Am Breads story mode (which takes around four to six hours to complete, depending on how good you are), I was able to get around with some degree of speed and even accuracy, halted only by hazardous surfaces and occasional confusion over which corner was which. Also, if you're totally stuck, failing a level a few times causes a power-up to appear that grants you infinite edibility and grip if you touch it. It's tempting to turn your nose up at this and the dismal end-of-level scores it brings, but it's an excellent way for the easily frustrated to experiment with each level without the constant frustration of failure  and experimentation is a big part of I Am Bread's fun."", 'Each of the eight suburban-themed levels is a huge physics playground, filled with breakable objects and rewarding secrets to find. Aside from ""get toasted,"" there isn\'t really any direction, so there\'s a certain thrill in discovering that  for example  rubbing up against butter and jam improves your deliciousness score, or that flopping onto a skateboard can create a safe path from a table to a counter. And while the radiator on the other side of the room might seem like an obvious toaster substitute, it\'s a lot more fun to find out that you can also smash a TV in the same room and toast yourself on its fiery wreckage.', ""That sense of discovery also extends to the non-story modes, which unlock gradually and reshuffle each environment. Rampage, for example, is a wonderfully cathartic mode that swaps out your bread slice for a destructive baguette, and fills your surroundings with smashable objects. Cheese Hunt seems boring at first, but after a while, ferreting out stinky cheese hunks as a fragile cracker becomes strangely satisfying. On the other hand, Free Roam's lack of danger or goals may be great for experimentation, but quickly turn dull, while Bagel Race  in which you roll an unsteady bagel through a high-speed obstacle course  is too linear and unforgiving to really be enjoyable. Both are rendered insignificant, however, by the engrossing Zero-G, which outfits your bread slice with realistic space thrusters and challenges you to find a way to toast yourself while navigating a minefield of floating objects, all while accompanied by serene choral music."", ""Once you get over the initial frustration of learning to survive in each new level, learning its secrets can be hugely rewarding  provided you can also put up with I Am Bread's myriad glitches. Some of these are the stuff of YouTube gold  touching certain objects just right, for example, can send your slice spiraling wildly around the level, and getting stuck on level geometry can turn your bread into an uncontrollable mass of flailing corners. Other bugs are less entertaining, like repeatedly falling through the world at one level's start (which was fixed by quitting out and coming back). Certain levels also consistently caused performance problems on my test PC, dipping the framerate from a steady 30fps to an unplayable three, so there's clearly some work still to be done.""]",IGN
5,BoxBoy!,5-May-15,Jose Otero,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/05/boxboy-review,"['BoxBoy builds a devilishly smart puzzle platformer out of a simple premise. Like any good puzzle game, it tosses lots of variety on top of an easy-to-learn idea, in this case revolving around a plain-looking living box that turns into more boxes. But what makes it a great game is how well the collection of puzzles comes together for over 100 stages, and beyond.', 'The core concept of BoxBoy couldnt be any simpler: You play as Qbby, a small white box with tiny arms and legs. He cant jump very far or high, but Qbby does have a surprisingly useful talent: he can replicate himself to create a string of boxes, an ability with clever applications like creating a bridge of boxes to safely cross over deadly pits, or building three-block staircases to  reach higher platforms. The early stages contain lots of easy levels that painlessly introduce us to these ideas.', 'But just two or three hours into the six-hour campaign, BoxBoy satisfied my need for a puzzling challenge. It continued to unfold and present even more interesting and progressively wackier mechanics along the way, never reusing any for too long, and each new implementation feels clever. You can use five boxes to shield Qbby from deadly lasers, or use a string of attached boxes as an anchor to pull yourself to a ledge  and thats just the start.', 'Later levels offer a stiff challenge, but it never feels overbearing or cheap. Occasional tutorial videos play on loop in the background of some levels, but BoxBoy never outright reveals the solution (unless you use the buy a hint help system). Instead, it uses excellent level design to push you in the right direction. When I wasnt sure what to do, experimentation would show me the way forward. BoxBoy doesnt punish you for trying either  if you die, you respawn immediately at a nearby checkpoint, ready to try, try again. Some of the harder levels conveniently tuck checkpoints into the puzzles themselves, as a helpful way to understand that youre on the right track.', 'BoxBoys simple black-and-white graphics wont light the world on fire with their personality or style, but its not a huge detractor either. The world can feel charming at times, but also very sterile  Ive seen actual scientific labs with more specks of personality than these monochrome rooms  but by efficiently clearing levels you unlock currency to spend on silly costumes, which provide just a dash of humor. Theres just something about clearing a level as a box dressed as a ninja, a rapper, or a wacky professor that gave it a little extra flavor.', '', 'BoxBoy can create a string of boxes to protect himself or reach higher platforms.']",IGN
6,Broken Age: Act 2,26-Apr-15,Marty Sliva,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/26/broken-age-act-2-review,"['Spoilers for Act 1 ahead. Head over here for our full Broken Age: Act 1 review.', 'Broken Age: Act 2 is a smart, fun, challenging cap to Double Fines Kickstarted adventure. Still just as gorgeous and well-written, Act 2 is nearly twice as long as its predecessor. It ups the ante with surprising new characters, intriguing story reveals, and some really ingenious puzzles for the most part. There are a few nagging challenges along the way, but nothing that really detracts from the fantastic adventure at hand.', '\n', ""Picking up right at Act 1s phenomenal cliffhanger, a bulk of Act 2's charm is how it flips the first parts script on its head. I really enjoyed how the theme of role reversal seeps through nearly every moment of Act 2. Exploring a decrepit Mog Chothra as Vella, and meeting the citizens of Meriloft as Shay shine new light on the events of the first half of the game. Controlling both characters as they come to terms with the realizations that theyve been lied to for a bulk of their lives constantly provides hilarious, and often-times poignant moments. It's a well-written and surprisingly-mature story of growing up, dealing with the messes life throws at you, and ultimately coming out a better person."", ""That being said, I was a little bit disappointed that Act 2 takes place predominantly in the same locales as Act 1, albeit under very different circumstances. I loved revisiting folks and seeing how they've changed, such as Curtis giving up wood working in favor of becoming a metal smith, but I wished there had been more new characters and locations. Maybe Im just being greedy, but I loved discovering each new setting so much, and I wish Act 2 kept throwing those surprises at me."", 'Still, those settings are again populated with some of the most interesting characters in modern adventure games, and Broken Age shines because of their incredible interactions. Vellas rocky friendship with a violent, sentient knife is hilarious, and choosing which awful tree-puns Shay uses on a morose oak brings back fond memories of the insult sword fighting in the Monkey Island series. I found myself trying out every single item on every single character in the world, not because I thought it would help solve a puzzle, but because I just wanted to hear every fantastic line of dialogue.', '\n', 'But rest assured, the puzzles in Act 2 are mostly top-notch. It really plays with the dual-character setup by peppering puzzle solutions across both halves of the adventure. For example, spending some quality time with a snake as Shay is going to help you answer some strange questions as Vella. The puzzles in Act 2 are much larger, more complicated tasks, but most of the time that means the reward for solving them is that much sweeter. However, there are a handful of challenges with vague objectives that ultimately require oddly precise timing to accomplish. Early on in Vellas story, I found myself getting frustrated as I tried again and again to get the timing down on a puzzle where I had to swing a rope at a specific item.', 'A handful of bad apples aside, Broken Age: Act 2 doled out satisfying puzzles at a fantastic rate, and provided dozens of wonderful aha! moments that separate great adventure games from the rest of the pack. Adding to this is the fact that most of the puzzles contain a plot or character element to them, meaning that every time you solve one, you flesh out a bit more of the world around you.', '\n']",IGN
7,Wolfenstein: The Old Blood,8-May-15,Marty Sliva,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/08/wolfenstein-the-old-blood-review,"['Wolfenstein: The Old Blood is a strange beast. As a six-hour, stand-alone prequel to 2014s excellent Wolfenstein: The New Order, it puts us through a grinder of tense, exciting, and memorable shootouts in some really great settings. But while The New Order shined brightest during its quiet moments of exploration and character development, The Old Blood never really gives you time to catch your breath during its descent to zombie-filled strangeness. That unrelenting pace makes it lots of fun, but not as thoughtful as its stand-out predecessor.', 'Taking place during the late 40s, The Old Blood once again places you in the blood-soaked boots of B.J. Blazkowicz, back before he saved the world from Deathsheads alternate-history evil. The story this time around has you infiltrating mountainside fortresses, escaping Nazi prisons, and fighting waves of zombies, but nothing about the story ever really felt memorable. Like so many entertaining but forgettable shooters before it, The Old Blood comes across more like an automated shooting range, most notable for presenting you with diverse locations to shoot all manner of baddies in. From the torchlit halls of Castle Wolfenstein to cryptic caves underneath burning villages, you briskly move from place to place, and encounter to encounter. While this speed keeps the action hot, I really did miss New Orders surprisingly effective detours into character relationships, non-combat areas, and story. That felt brave and bold in a way this doesnt.', '\n', 'In place of those palate cleansers, The Old Blood uses stealth puzzles that act as nice buffers to the action. Many of these have you sneaking around rooms and turning off electricity to hulking, tethered mechs, taking out sentry guards in heavily fortified areas, and using your all-purpose pipe weapon/tool to climb up walls and jimmy open doors. These scenes turn down the volume, but keep the tension high, as many enemies are able to tear you apart extremely quickly if you get caught. While checkpoints are generally plentiful across The Old Bloods eight chapters, there were a few tough stealth sections where I managed to remain hidden for well over 10 minutes, only to be spotted within sight of my goal and frustratingly forced to repeat the whole thing over again.', 'In addition to these scenarios, I really appreciated the various nods to other Bethesda-owned games peppered throughout The Old Blood. During my time in this alternate history, I spotted Fallouts Nuka Cola, a Dragonborn helmet from Skyrim, and a pixilated model of Quake 3s rocket launcher.', ""When you do find yourself in combat, which I promise happens quite a bit, the scenarios are by and largely satisfying. Arenas are multi-level, filled with cover points, and peppered with secret passages. Each weapon, from the precise Bombenschluss to the room-clearing Kampfpistol, has a balanced use throughout the campaign. Managing scarce ammo, knowing which weapon to use on which type of soldier, and constantly surveying the surroundings for cues make these fights more interesting and satisfying than the typical run-and-gun. But while the weapons all feel good in their own right, none of them really do anything unique when it comes to genre. Shotguns, sniper rifles, and explosives act exactly as youd expect from a shooter in 2015, and while that makes for some fun encounters, they don't really deliver any surprises. Apart from this, it was nice to see prototype versions of what would become standard enemies 20 years later in The New Order, like a janky version of the mechanical dog that stalked us back in 2014s game."", '\n', 'That said, Im disappointed that The Old Blood didnt take the opportunity to fix some of New Orders nagging issues, particularly the repetitive effort required to pick up items. I was already tired of hitting a button every time I want to grab health, armor, ammo, or a collectable when I got here, and Old Blood only exacerbates this problem by throwing even larger piles of items at you. Theres no reason you wouldnt want to pick up everything, so the lack of streamlining this action definitely adds a layer of tedium.', 'The other weird issue with The Old Blood is the bizarre tone shift from Nazi-killing and espionage to apocalyptic zombie horror that occurs about two-thirds of the way through the campaign. It mightve felt justified if zombies were something more than dumber, bullet-spongier versions of regular enemies, but thats all they are. Theyre not scary, theyre not interesting. Theyre just...there, being dumb zombies. Strategy and excitement definitely takes a hit in the final chapters, but the variety and action carry this short shooter through to the end.']",IGN
8,StarDrive 2,20-Apr-15,Rob Zacny,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/20/stardrive-2-review,"['Where StarDrive 1 is a giant, rambling mess of a 4X game, StarDrive 2 is divided into discrete segments of varying quality and cohesion. At its heart its still about ship design and combat, and this time the execution is good enough that playing Space Admiral and ship designer ends up being enjoyable. But it\'s in service of a strategy game that overwhelmingly focuses on the ""exterminate"" portion of the 4X formula to the exclusion of all else, which ultimately makes StarDrive 2 feel a bit two dimensional.', ""StarDrive 2 lifts a page from Total War's book by having tactical space and ground battles that occur separately from the turn-based 4X layer, on which you do the usual mix of exploration, colonization, planetary development, and diplomatic negotiation. But these pieces don't all fit together equally well, and tend to get in one anothers way."", ""At its very best, StarDrive is a space admiralty simulator. There are a lot of different things to take into account when designing your fleet: the power draw of your weapons and engines, the weight of your armor and equipment, the output of your engines, and the overall maneuverability of your ships. It's an enjoyable exercise in trade-offs and forecasting; when I'm sitting there in the ship designer, I'm thinking about how the carrier I'm building is going to support the battleship I just designed, and how their protection from long-range missiles will rely on an electronic warfare cruiser I'm planning to design next."", ""It's not just a case of slapping the latest and greatest technology onto the old templates (though you can easily exchange outmoded equipment if you need to). That's because StarDrive 2 cleverly offers you mutually exclusive research opportunities in groups of three. Once you've researched one technology from a trio, the other two are closed off to you, except through trade or conquest. That means that your rivals can have very different threat profiles that you need to take into account as you build your ships. Are you going to be fighting the Draylok, who have a lot of long-range missile technologies but seem to be lagging when it comes to close-range weaponry? Or are you more like to end up at war with the Kulrathi, who have big ships with lots of armor, but whose focus on energy weapons requires massive reactors and power capacitors? You'd want a different fleet for each fight, and guessing at the right balance is the most interesting challenge StarDrive 2 offers."", 'The real-time combat in which all these plans come to fruition, however, is slightly less rewarding. The AI seems to beeline for your ships almost regardless of what weapons it has access to. My ship design choices still mattered, but most battles ended up turning into scrums as capital ships twisted and turned at close range, which made them far less tactically interesting than the ship designs imply.', '', 'Still the best part.', 'Where StarDrive 2 is least successful is when it comes to ground combat, which is a very simple turn-based combat game in which two armies line up on opposite sides of a grid and start marching at each other. While you can equip your troops with different weapons and items that give them special abilities, the ground combat mostly feels like a slow-motion math problem where firepower and weight of numbers take their toll. It feels like an afterthought.', ' ', 'Outside of combat, StarDrive 2 is also a very familiar type of 4X, and this is where the results are decidedly mixed. The first game introduced a lot of the enjoyable goofy characters (like the Pollops, a race of sentient hippie plants) who are back for another round, and there are even more neat narrative touches and random events to spice things up. Menacing and mysterious aliens ships conduct raids on your territory, your generals might give you special quests, and you might encounter strange anomalies in space that will reward you if you investigate them. Minute-to-minute, StarDrive 2 can be a fun, if simple, strategy game.', ""Take a wider view, however, and that simplicity proves very limiting  and at times a bit puzzling. There is no real concept of territory in StarDrive 2, despite some coloring on the starmap. You'll get a warning when you cross into another race's territory, but other races will colonize absolutely every rock they can lay their hands on, including planets in your home system. There are no diplomatic options to keep them from doing it, so you always end up with potentially hostile fleets cruising around your own space unless you lock everything down first."", 'More like inevitably hostile, because all roads eventually lead to war in StarDrive 2, even without the help of randomly and at times suicidally aggressive AI faction behavior. That\'s a shame, because the diplomacy system has some great ideas that dont get a chance to pay off. Each trade you do with another faction consumes ""tolerance,"" so you can\'t just farm your best friends for technologies. Every race is a bit xenophobic, so you have to really think about what you want to ask them for in each negotiation. It really does feel like Im developing relationships with alien races who aren\'t too sure about me. But without victory conditions besides galactic deathmatch, eventually you\'re going to have to kill your friends.']",IGN

The pieces are all there, but they are patched together in a dry, passionless way that left me feeling emptier the longer I played it."", ""Chronicle's uninspired story is probably the best example of this. It's stitched loosely together with still drawing sequences that bookend each level. Apparently the main character, an assassin named Shao Jun is out for revenge against the Templars for...something. The voice actors playing the two main characters sounded positively bored throughout, making it hard for me to connect my actions with their motivations in any meaningful way."", ""Fortunately the game itself is more well-constructed than its story, though it feels no less dispassionate. Chronicle's muted colors and sparse environments make levels feel hollow, but they're incredibly well laid out. Smart use of multiple background layers makes each area feel like a place rather than a flat plane these characters exist on. They also stretch out as far vertically as they do horizontally, providing multiple paths to your objectives. Exploring and seeing how the different paths connect to one another is probably the best part of Assassins Creed Chronicles: China."", 'Except, perhaps, for the occasional sections where you need to make a fast getaway, fluidly running, sliding and killing without missing a step. In these moments, Chronicles feels like an endless runner, and its almost better off for it; the actual stealth gameplay that makes up its core feels safe, even tepid by comparison. Theres a pleasing number of variables in play: differently-armed enemies that require specific attacks to defeat, the ability to hang off ledges, and the option to grapple your way up to certain ceilings. Particularly for a side-scroller, theres a lot of tools at your disposal.', 'Variety isnt the problem, rather, its the simplicity of the answers. Chronicles gives you lots of different tools and obstacles, but the one youre supposed to use at any given time is pretty obvious. Theres some room for improvisation, but it usually boils down to playing by the unwritten rules, and waiting a few seconds for guards to return to their regular patrol routes if you break from the script. Rarely did I feel rewarded for being clever.', 'Even direct combat, which usually makes me feel powerful in other Assassins Creeds, feels oddly subdued. Battle animations are smooth, but devoid of style or energy. Interestingly, its more challenging than the combat found in the main series, with precision timing being required to even block incoming attacks. Coupled with the fact that you can only take a couple of hits before going down, and suddenly, taking on even two enemies at once becomes a test. This places a pleasing emphasis on staying out of trouble, with the option to fight your way out if you have the skill, but combat is conveyed in such a visually lackluster way, that it never felt thrilling. In fact, being a skilled assassin never felt so plain.']",IGN
10,Story of Seasons,1-May-15,Meghan Sullivan,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/01/story-of-seasons-review,"['Despite the difference in its name, Story of Seasons is very much a Harvest Moon game in spirit  and one of the best Ive played in years. Its dynamic mix of old-school farm simulation and new inventory logistics makes it feel different and unique. Though it moves slower than a plow ox at the beginning, by the end there was barely enough time in the day to enjoy running my farm, managing my shop, doing business with travelling merchants, and exploring the nearby safari.', 'Running a farm in Story of Season has a satisfyingly rhythmic feel to it. Picking vegetables in a garden and spinning homemade overalls out of sheeps wool feels cathartic, as does selling goods for a tidy profit. That sounds like something you do in every farming simulator of course, but Story of Seasons adds a few significant tweaks that differentiate it from its Harvest Moon brethren.', '', 'She works hard for the money.', 'For example, instead of plucking turnips from the ground one by one, you can scoop up a whole batch with a quick tap of the A button. Fishing is easy, too: trout and salmon can be caught with a traditional rod, or by swimming in the local rivers. Theres also a handy multiplayer option that allows friends to exchange gifts and help harvest each others fields. But my favorite new feature is the special seeds that sprout into Nintendo-themed items, like a Super Mario 1-Up mushroom that makes produce spring up faster. Its a fun and clever mechanic that adds variety to the harvest, and speeds up progress.', 'Spending less time on repetitive farm chores during my 30-hour adventure meant more time to go off and explore the lovely countryside, which includes a cool safari area. There, you can bring farm animals to graze (yielding better animal products), mine for valuable ore, and best of all, keep a menagerie of exotic pets like monkeys and penguins. The land around your farm is fairly large too, which gives ample opportunity to look for unique types of bugs and flowers to collect.', 'The biggest and best new idea, though, is in Story of Seasons use of economics and inventory management. In most farm sims Ive played, you make a profit just by tossing turnips into a crate and waiting for the money to pile up. Here, its deeper and more involved than that: you have to ship items to travelling merchants, who dole out more money for specific things on specific days when demand is high.', 'Making sure I had the right items at the right time (like dairy products to serve the needs of customers coming from Silk Country, or seafood for the people of Wheat Country) involved a welcome bit of strategy. I was constantly checking my calendar to see who was coming into town, then stocking inventory accordingly so that I had whatever a merchant needed. Eventually I was able to open up my own little stall in the local trade depot and sell my own wares (which was great when merchants werent around), but even then I kept up a steady stream of business with foreign shopkeepers, since doing so would attract better traders with better items for my farm.', '\n', 'Alongside turning the town into an international trading hub, theres an opportunity to turn the sleepy hamlet of Oaktown into a popular tourist destination. Sprucing up public areas may sound dull, but its surprisingly fun thanks to the design tools that let you arrange decorative items like park benches and flower beds to your liking.  I felt a sense of pride whenever the visitor count ticked up.', 'If theres one unique feature in Story of Seasons that misses, its the farming competition. This idea requires you to compete with other farmers for use of public land, which is needed to more effectively grow crops like corn and spices, by shipping the most items in day. Its supposed to add another layer of strategy, but it feels like an obstacle more than anything else, since the best way to win is to stockpile goods and wait until the day of the competition to sell them. I hated having to do that, since it meant waiting longer before I received funds to upgrade my farm, and there wasnt much to do in the meantime except tap my foot.', 'Which brings me to the one other significant problem: the pacing. Like its Harvest Moon predecessors, Story of Seasons gives you very little to do in the beginning. Options are limited to a small handful of activities including fishing, planting, and bug collecting. Those are all decently fun things, but they started to get boring well before I could open up more activities to spread them out. It didnt help that there was only one merchant in town during the first farming season, which meant several in-game days went by without the ability to sell goods and buy more fun things to use on my farm (like a cheese factory).', 'Luckily, going into town is always an interesting experience. Oaktowns layout is comprehensive, with shops and houses divided into neat, accessible areas connected by flights of stairs. That means you dont have to waste time running through empty space just to chew the cud with one of the locals, all of whom are interesting. (I especially got a kick out of Elise, whose snobby attitude and high opinion of herself is pretty darn amusing.)', '', 'Counting his chickens before they hatch.', 'Speaking of the locals, I really enjoy Story of Seasons pool of eligible bachelors and bachelorettes, who felt slightly more diverse than in the Harvest Moon games. I especially liked the dashing restaurant manager Raegear, the charming Klaus, and the stunning novelist Iris, all of whom felt more age appropriate than the teens and tweens of Harvest Moon. Wooing them wasnt too difficult (all I needed to do was give gifts and converse with them a lot), but their personalities made it an entertaining way to spend my time while waiting for crops to grow and merchants to arrive.']",IGN
11,Magicka: Wizard Wars,5-May-15,Rob Zacny,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/05/magicka-wizard-wars-review,"[""Magicka: Wizard Wars seems like it should be better than it is. On paper it's a sure-fire winner: take Magicka, with its comical little wizards and huge number of elemental spell combos and counterspells, add team-based multiplayer, and make it free-to-play in a fair and appealing way. So why is the reality so frequently lackluster? It remains a fun game, because theres something inherently enjoyable about that skill-based Magicka formula, but Wizard Wars shows how a poorly thought-out MOBA-inspired design can suck the magic out of a game."", 'Developer Paradox North hasnt done Wizard Wars any favors in saddling it with a surprisingly crude and unstable client. Wizard Wars may bring back some unwelcome memories of Magicka 1s famously rocky co-op: half my attempts to join a session have ended in crashes or matchmaking failures. I\'ve sat in a game lobby for several minutes, watching fellow players flicker in and out, resetting the countdown timer each time they reconnect. When a game ends, you get a fleeting glance at the score screen before ""CONNECTION LOST"" pops-up and you\'re dumped back to the main menu. Or the desktop, depending on how Wizard Wars is feeling that day.', 'It\'s not game-killingly bad. Most of the time I\'m able to find a match within a few minutes of sitting down (give or take a few restarts), and once I\'m in, I\'ll almost certainly get to play it through to the end. But there are also times when either matchmaking is broken or there is practically nobody online playing  even in the week following the official launch. Either seems plausible, but it means that Wizard Wars is a game that I always approach with the mindset of ""I\'ll try to play,"" rather than ""I\'m going to play.""', ""Once you get into a match, things are much more stable. The trouble is that even when Wizard Wars is on its best technical behavior, you're playing a MOBA version of Magicka where the MOBA and the Magicka aspects don't complement each other so much as just exist alongside each other."", ""Of Wizard Wars' three game modes, Wizard Warfare is the clear winner. It's a control-point-based spawn-ticket game where the first team to run out of respawns, or to be locked out of all the spawn points, loses the game. It's fast-paced, dynamic, and progresses to a swift endgame. There are several different maps, each one has slightly different dynamics that allow for sneak attacks and rush strategies."", ""The one-on-one Wizard Duel probably gives you purest magical competition. There's a couple teleporters to allow players to maneuver, but it really comes down to casting spells and blocks more effectively that your opponent. On the other hand, the distance is so compressed that it starts to feel a little random. Whoever gets a little behind on hit points is easy prey for spammed melee attacks, and wizard melees always felt a little anticlimactic to me."", ""But most of the time, and especially in the other game modes, victory is a matter of who proves to be the better wizard. You can queue up to three spells, combining different effects to make new spells, and then choosing how you want to cast them. It's all as enjoyable as ever, though a bit overwhelming at the start. With time, however, I took great satisfaction in casting protective wards on my character based on what spells other players were favoring (giving myself wards against Death and Fire magic, for instance, when I saw players making use of fiery beams of Death magic). Knowing what spells will be effective against which defenses, and how to deploy shields and traps of your own to defend yourself, gives Wizard Wars a bit of the feeling of a fighting game."", ""That works well in Wizard War and the Duels, but the MOBA-style Soul Harvest game mode ends up being a misfire because it shoehorns Magicka gameplay into a drawn-out format that doesnt suit it. Since Magicka wizards don't level up or get more powerful as the game goes on, there is nothing to create an endgame. The two teams merely cycle around creep camps, slaughtering the same groups of mindless monsters, until they bring down each other's defenses and can destroy the other team's effigy. Fighting other players is almost a waste of time, especially since the respawn timers never change. In fact, if you win a big teamfight near the end of a game, it becomes harder to finish them off because your opponents instantly respawn at their base, which means they'll be waiting for you when you get there. When you have a MOBA where you're telling your team not to fight other players because winning will cost you the game, something has gone awry."", 'The odds of having a fair game are also pretty small, unfortunately. Whether it\'s because of the server instability issues that I experienced in the client, or because Wizard Wars does nothing to discourage people from abandoning games or being abusive (there\'s no ""report player"" option), most games I\'ve played have seen the 4v4 erode into a 4v3, or even a 4v2 or 3v2. That\'s a hard blow in a Soul Harvest game, which depends entirely on team\'s abilities to spread out across the map to farm for souls.', ""It's stuff like this that really hurts Wizard Wars as a competitive game. Not being able to report players is infuriating in a MOBA that allows friendly fire. One of my first games had a player on my team running around killing everyone in his path, whether a friendly or not, and it cost us the game after 30 or 40 minutes of misery. The griefer was the second-highest scoring player. Any online competitive game needs a way to deal with people like that. Wizard Wars doesn't have one."", 'Since Magicka doesn\'t really have distinct characters (everyone is a faceless robed figure with access to the same set of spells) it\'s metagame elements take the place of traditional MOBA class and character distinctions. You can buy (with real money or in-game gold) items and equipment that provide special bonuses and penalties. You also gain experience and unlock masteries, which give you access to special equipment and special, limited-use powers (think ""ultimates"" in other MOBAs).', ""So it's important to play to your strengths: I favor Death magic, so my special robe, staff, and underpants (hey, this is Magicka) all give me Death magic bonuses, but at the expense of penalties to Fire. So Fire has basically vanished from my repertoire while Death is a part of almost every spell combo I use. However, it's harder to approach other players the same way. You can see their bonuses before a match starts but, once you're in-game, who is going to remember that the green wizard with the chainmail has a healing bonus and extra HP while the guy in the ninja robes has... wait, I forgot what the ninja robe does. See what I mean?"", ""Finally, there is the store where you can buy things with real money or currency earned during battle. As you play, you get treasure chests that have to be unlocked with keys (similar to Dota 2s system). You don't know what's in the chest, but you do know how rare it is, so there's always a temptation to go get some keys when you're sitting on particularly rare loot. You can also just buy some equipment outright. Yet I never felt like I was getting the hard sell. Wizard Wars isn't a poorer experience with basic gear, and fundamentally it's the same game no matter what you're using in battle."", ""Which is, of course, Wizard Wars' biggest problem. As I said at the start, there is something fundamentally enjoyable about Magicka, and the same is true of Wizard Wars. Magicka has always been a lighter, sillier kind of game about semi-competent wizards running around blowing themselves and others to pieces. However, Wizard Wars' conservative approach to adapting Magicka to the MOBA template makes for a game that's long on repetition and short on tactical depth.""]",IGN

Heres what we said then:', '', '\n', 'Grand Theft Auto 5 is not only a preposterously enjoyable video game, but also an intelligent and sharp-tongued satire of contemporary America. It represents a refinement of everything that GTA 4 brought to the table five years ago. Its technically more accomplished in every conceivable way, but its also tremendously ambitious in its own right. No other world in video games comes close to this in size or scope, and there is sharp intelligence behind its sense of humour and gift for mayhem. It tells a compelling, unpredictable, and provocative story without ever letting it get in the way of your own self-directed adventures through San Andreas.', 'It is one of the very best video games ever made.', '', '\n', 'Thats still where we stand on it today. And whether you agree that its a masterpiece or not, the PC version is definitely the best way to play GTA 5. Developer Rockstar has taken full advantage of the technical power of the platform, and made GTA feel right at home here. Its well optimized, and the frame rate and resolution will go as high as your hardware can handle  including 4K/UHD resolutions and multi-display setups. Maxed out, the enormous and incredibly detailed open-world region of San Andreas looks more amazing than ever, thanks to long draw distances and enhanced effects. This is the only place you can play GTA 5 at 60 frames per second (or higher), and with all the high-speed driving and shooting, it definitely benefits from that smoothness.', 'Graphics options are plentiful and powerful, with everything from standard quality and view-distance adjustments to a field-of-view slider (though its more limited than discriminating FOV players might want - modders have already remedied that). Controls are customizable, and you can play your own music library on the in-game radio. Its hard to complain much about that.', 'For the most part, the menus are well done and feel good to use with the mouse. Thats best exemplified with the web browser, which feels like youd expect navigating a web page with a mouse to feel. The one place this breaks down a little is in the score menus; its a little tougher to navigate an Ammunation gun stores wares with the mouse than it is with a D-pad or arrow keys, but its still totally workable. Its simply a small reminder that this wasnt originally a PC game.', 'Using a mouse to shoot, on the other hand, is good enough that it risks making combat feel a little too easy. I dont pretend to be a brilliant marksman, but if youre a bad guy (or a cop) in Los Santos, your odds of even making it out of your car to start shooting drop considerably when Im using a mouse. Without the scourge of auto-aim dragging the targeting reticule down toward center mass, I found myself picking off most enemies with a single shot to the head, especially when playing in first-person mode. That doesnt mean I felt invincible, though; because the authorities will never stop coming until you give up and run away or die, theyre always going to give you a challenging fight through the weight of sheer numbers.', 'Nice PC-specific control touches, like not having to hammer a button to keep up running speed (just hold down Shift) and being able to hit a single button (Caps Lock by default) to activate a special ability make everything feel like a native PC game. You dont get the annoying horizontal drift when running in first-person like you do in the PS4 and Xbox One versions, either.', 'One of my favorite things about the control setup, though, is that like GTA 4 and a select few other games before it, GTA 5 lets you seamlessly swap between the mouse and keyboard and a gamepad on the fly. No need to go into a menu and swap - just push a button on one or the other, and all on-screen prompts change to reflect what youre using. Its a fantastic thing for a game like this, where running and gunning is more precise with a mouse and keyboard but driving or especially flying benefits greatly from the analog input of a thumbstick. You can even use both at once, if you like.\n', 'Then theres GTA Online, which has been very well behaved this week (Im as surprised as you!). Though Ive experienced the occasional disconnect or bout of lag, its nothing out of the ordinary for an online game that matches up groups of up to 30 players. What is out of the ordinary is how diverse and varied the available activities are: dozens of different types of deathmatches, co-op missions (including the all-new and very impressive multi-stage heists), races over land, sea, and air (some of which involving combat), and general open-world chaos like spontaneous drive-by shootings (or strafing runs) of other players. The online version of San Andreas is a place where anything can happen at any time, and its fantastic to watch people make use of that freedom, even if the majority of it is the inherent humor of crashing things into other things.', '\n', 'The main PC-specific feature is the Rockstar Editor movie tool and its associated Director Mode, which gives you access to a wide spectrum of playable character models. Its a powerful creative tool that lets you easily capture gameplay clips and then edit and export them into what can end up as extremely elaborate movies. I did experience a crash that robbed me of about an hours work on a classy short film about a man in an alien costume who punches people on a beach without provocation. I love the flexibility of the camera and the simplicity of the editing controls  they make me wish I had a finer eye for filmmaking as I go for easy laughs with a montage of slow-motion close ups of fists hitting faces. Fortunately, there are far more creatively talented folks out there who will entertain us for years to come with GTA 5-made machinima.']",IGN
13,Shadowrun Chronicles: Boston Lockdown,5-May-15,Leif Johnson,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/05/shadowrun-chronicles-boston-lockdown-review,"[""Sure, there may be shotgun-toting orcs and dwarves on the mean streets of futuristic Boston, but when you're born an troll, it seems only right to toss aside guns of your own and chase ruffians down with a big slab of lumber with a nail in it. That's how I approached Shadowrun Chronicles: Boston Lockdown  the latest game in the slightly odd renaissance of the 1980s Tolkien-meets-Gibson sci-fi universe  but my brutish approach wasnt as rewarding as Id expected based on previous Shadowruns. As with so many elements in this overly simplified cooperative tactical roleplaying game, there's not enough surrounding the act of smashing, smashing, and smashing to maintain its appeal over time."", ""But in case it's not clear, I love my troll. One of the strongest aspects of Boston Lockdown is its character creator, and by the time I stepped out into the historic homeland of Paul Revere and Whitey Bulger for the first time, I had a Red Sox cap perched between my horns and a leather jacket barely concealing my brutish figure. The cosmetic options are surprisingly rich; I never once ran across anyone else who looked quite like me in the MMO-style central hub zone."", ""That catch is that diversity is largely faux-leather-jacket deep. This being Shadowrun, you can play as a number of Tolkien-ish races such as dwarves and orcs, but the racial bonuses are so tiny as to be near inconsequential. As an troll, my guy got a single-point damage boost to blunt weapons, which quickly ventures into pointlessness after the first or second level-up. It's a shame, too, that you can't extend that depth of character creation to the hirable henchmen you bring along on your journey, who look bland almost to a one and come with preset (and sometimes useless) skills. I half-suspected this was intentional, a handicap designed to nudge me into using the handy co-op options thatre activated by simply clicking on players in the hub. Besides looking cooler,  there's usually a good chance that the real players will have the specific skills I need to get the job done."", 'The hub itself isn\'t too much to look at, either. Boston Lockdown honors its setting with passable accents and recognizable sports paraphernalia, but the hub in which you spend all your time in-between missions is just ye olde cyberpunk grungehole that could just as easily be in futuristic Houston as the City on a Hill. The story itself is serviceable enough, but it makes a significant break with the existing Shadowrun revival games by not allowing branching dialogue options. It\'s a strange omission, and I kept expecting them to show up since the text boxes seemed designed for them. As the plot unfolds, we get to see a fairly enjoyable look into an ""alternate"" world where evil corporations control the country, but it loses some of its roleplaying cred in the process. It doesn\'t help that the missions retain a samey flavor regardless of how far into the 15-hour campaign you are, and they all involve wiping out the bad guys rather than tackling some non-standard objectives for the sake of variety.', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', ""Design decisions like these drive home the realization that Boston Lockdown is concerned with combat above all else, as its tactical combat is actually quite good, given that youre playing with a team that has a basic grasp of tactics. It's quite tough, too. I jumped into the first mission expecting to breeze through, but I found myself dead in a handful of turns because some punk behind a car managed to plug two slugs into me. I didn't even get a chance to smash."", 'It\'s initially jarring to learn that Boston Lockdown doesn\'t have an ""Overwatch"" option (such as the one found in XCOM,) but it\'s soon clear that this is because developer Cliffhanger gives a lot of love to melee-favoring brutes like my troll. Melee here is high risk but high reward  complete with a 100 percent hit chance  which means that if I can just get into range, I\'m almost guaranteed to make a glorious mess of the bad guys. The smart AI makes the experience even more enjoyable. They\'re prone to taking advantage of Boston Lockdown\'s heavy emphasis on flanking shots, and I rarely found myself in a mission where I didn\'t feel as though Id earned and deserved the victory. My only real complaint about the combat is that it grows too samey over the long haul, in large part because the skill trees really only consist of non-transformative options for existing skills, which ruins the sense of progression and discovery.', 'The real danger, though, is getting burned by poor experiences with reckless players. A few times that was enough to send me running back to pick up three of those bland AI companions. That made me sad, because without other human brains in the mix, the streamlined skill system runs the danger of losing my interest compared to its more complex cousins in the other recent Shadowrun games.', 'Complicating matters further are server troubles. Boston Lockdown is plagued by horrible server lag that can sometimes cause half a minute to go by before one of your orcs or elves responds to a command. Its worth noting that it ran fine in the pre-launch beta period, so we know it can run smoothly - it just doesnt do so reliably as of this writing.']",IGN

Infinite Crisis is a beautiful, cartoony MOBA that handles the DC Comics characters with care. Unfortunately, despite its great looks, it fails to provide solid game balance, and its just too difficult to access many of its game modes."", 'Infinite Crisis distraught world has beautiful comic book aesthetics. Lore videos, hero introductions, and strong voice acting come together to create a great story.  Due to a tear in the multiverse, six universes blend together, which is how there can be multiple Batmans in the pool of available Champions. Each of the Batmans, Wonder Womans, Green Lanterns, and other characters have their own personality, so its fun seeing what they have to say to friends and enemies during in-game banter.', 'As most MOBAs go, theres a standard three-lane map, called Gotham Divided, but what I really like is that Infinite Crisis instead places its focus on Coast City, a two-lane map with a massive jungle. The Champion classes reflect this focus too. There are more jungle-centric Champions that can fight for control of not only their neutral creep camps, but also for the three vitally important Power Relays that give teams bonuses when captured. Its refreshing to see a PC MOBA focus on something other than the three-lane map while maintaining a nice balance between objectives and lane control.', ""While Coast City is fun, there's a lot to be desired from the other four modes. Right now Infinite Crisis is still in its infancy, so it's understandable that the player count is low. To make queue times faster, Coast City is the only open queue, and that's a problem. Sure, queue times are faster, but the other modes can only be played in a custom game which generally requires you to invite a few other players. If you're playing Infinite Crisis alone or don't have many friends on, then you're essentially unable to play the other modes."", ""The solution for these types of issues is usually filling the empty player slots with bots, but that's unfortunately not an option. There are only two bot modes; a 1v1 that isnt the same game type as its online counterpart  which is incredibly annoying  and Coast City. Aside from solving the queue problem, bots are incredibly important for learning the maps, new tactics with a few friends, exploring abilities and combos with new heroes, and then of course for people who just dont want to play online. This may not be an issue one day, but it feels incredibly punishing to early adopters."", ""One thing early adopters wont miss out on is a nice roster. Theres a diverse pool of characters to try with 41 Champions. Infinite Crisis has a weekly rotation of free Champions, and I found it easy to earn credits to buy Champions. The first Champion I bought was Poison Ivy, a character that showed just how Infinite Crisis tries to redefine character roles in MOBAs. Instead of being a straight support with low attack and heavy healing abilities, Ivy is able to hold her own ground  something I found to be true with other characters that'd be typically classified as a support, or a controller in Infinite Crisis."", 'I greatly disliked playing against the assassin role. True to the standard characteristics of the class, assassins are stealthy and deal heavy hits. However, in a game that doesnt have a cheap move speed item, the crazy assassin blinks and movement abilities feel like a big problem. Chasing after opponents in Infinite Crisis typically feels like a waste of time unless youve purchased the expensive blink item or have the Super Speed power chosen. However, for assassins like Nightmare Robin and Atomic Wonder Woman, they can easily catch up to their prey and do tons of damage then easily disengage. Even worse, assassins usually get very tanky in the late game. Imbalance in a MOBA is bound to happen, but it feels bad knowing its a problem across an entire class.', 'Thankfully Super Speed, one of Infinite Crisis 53 Stolen Powers did help me get away from assassins from time to time. Each Champion can pick two of these before a game begins. Theyre like Summoner Abilities in League of Legends, but way cooler. Most notable of these extra powers are Super Strength and Consume. With these two, you can pick up cars or rocks then throw them at enemies with the former, or use them to regain health with the latter. Those environmental objects can also block paths, so having these powers can totally change the flow of a match as you head into the mid and late game. Its incredibly useful, and adds another dynamic to keep in mind when building a team.']",IGN
15,Dungeons 2,21-Apr-15,Rowan Kaiser,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/21/dungeons-2-review,"['Theres just one slight issue with Dungeons 2: one half of it is bad. Any time a game attempts to split its attention between two entirely different modes, it runs the risk of having one side drag the other down. In this case, the entirely competent dungeon mode of Dungeons 2 is tied to a poorly made real-time strategy anchor and thrown out to sea, with no chance to swim home.', 'In theory, this is idea was clever! Moving into the endgame of a Dungeon Keeper-like management game has never been satisfying, so replacing it with an RTS battle mightve been a good payoff--thematically appropriate too, as it connects the idea of an underground evil corrupting a totally different surface. The central idea of Dungeons 2 is a good one. As a personification of Ultimate Evil, youre playing a Dungeon Keeper-like strategy game belowground  indirectly controlling your creatures to build rooms for efficiency, sending little imps out to find caves and gold, managing entertainment for bored creatures all this stuff works. When youve got a decent little army, you send them above the ground, where its a conventional real-time strategy game in the Warcraft vein: direct control over troops, right-click to move and attack, and so on.', 'And it feels like playing Warcraft...the first one, from 1994. Theres no major strategic element--you just find enemies and smash them. Nor is theres a significant tactical component. Things like attack-while-moving, or formations? Not present. A few units have skills, like upgraded orcs who can buff nearby units with a Battle Cry, But youll have to wrestle with the interface to get to them. There are hotkeys for the special skills, it turns out, but Dungeons 2 never makes this clear.', 'Obfuscation of important information, or poor explanation, is a consistent problem throughout Dungeons 2. It tells you what you need to do (often, and annoyingly, during the campaign) but rarely how you might go about doing it using the confusing interface. For example, on one campaign map, you have a mission to build an arena and train a unit with it. I did this, and consistently dropped my units on the new fighting pit. He or she would sit there, whack the training dummy for a while, gaining experience...and the narrator would continue to tell me I needed to train units. It turned out that by train, Dungeons 2 meant a much more specific use of the Arena: I had to drop the unit onto the pit, then click on the Arena and select a unit upgrade. That would get the narrator off my back... half an hour later. That was simply the most egregious example  far too much of my time was spent trying to figure out how to navigate three or more levels of maps, or why, despite clicking the attack button that appeared over an enemy trap, my troops were simply standing there and letting it kill them.', ' ', 'Yet even once I learned Dungeons 2s interface quirks, I found that its two-mode structure prevents its stronger management game from being any fun. Because all of the significant conflicts occur in the RTS overworld, this means that a huge section of any Dungeon Keeper-like game  dungeon defense  is utterly perfunctory. Occasionally a handful of enemy soldiers will pop in to keep you honest, but a handful of traps is usually enough to wipe them out. Since the dungeon is essentially a safe place all game  and since you will acquire hands-off resurrection tech for your troops  nothing stops you from just sitting for hours until you have the perfect army, then bashing through everything in the overworld.', 'Meanwhile, spell casting and research (an essential part of the genre) exists in Dungeons 2, but since most of the spells only work in your own territory, away from all the conflict that might require them, theyre rendered essentially useless. In the end, each Dungeons 2 maps middle and endgame consists of little more than get big army, right-click on giant armys target over and over.', 'So its up to the story to save Dungeons 2 from being a forgettable exercise... but it cant. Its focused on you, the Ultimate Evil, attempting to regain power and crush all the good heroes whod defeated you in the tutorial mission. This is fairly standard stuff within the dungeon-management genre, but its told almost entirely through the voice of an incredibly chatty narrator. The overall tone is supposed to be a genial British storybook narrator gone evil, and it succeeds in small doses. But the narrator never shuts up. Whatever charm he might have quickly disappears after yet another passive-aggressive demand to do the next mission in the quest log, regardless of your circumstances.']",IGN
16,Project CARS,6-May-15,Luke Reilly,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/06/project-cars-review,"['Project CARS isnt for everybody. Its a serious, deep, and demanding racing simulation for people who like their motorsport pure. Theres no pop punk soundtrack, or explosive takedowns, or generous rewinds. Developer Slightly Mad Studios set out to capture the experience of manhandling a real racing car around a long list of some of the worlds most famous racing circuits, and has thoroughly succeeded. Tough but satisfying and cruel but fair, Project CARS is a truly fantastic racing game with the potential to become a real force in the genre.', 'It is, however, for anybody  and this is an important distinction. Project CARS is probably the most user-friendly racing sim Ive ever played. Even a layman who wants to learn can delve into Project CARS and be able to find a series of settings and options that will massage it into an experience that suits them, because the list of things to tweak is frankly exhaustive. Theres a lot to admire here, from the incredibly authentic handling to its lavishly detailed cars and tracks and its potent sound, but Im seriously impressed at just how malleable this game is.', '\n', 'Project CARS features all the typical crutches, from braking assistance to stability control, but the options keep coming. Dont like where the on-screen track map sits on your HUD? Move it somewhere else. Do you play with a steering wheel peripheral and find it distracting to see an on-screen steering wheel too? You can delete the wheel from the dash. Its exceedingly well thought out.', 'What I like most, however, is the way Project CARS allows us to fine-tune the overall AI difficulty and race length before every single session. The AI operates on a slider from zero to 100, which gives you the freedom to find a sweet spot that matches your ability. Find yourself out-qualifying the pack by several seconds? Maybe dial the AI up a few notches until theyre on par with you. Settled on a satisfying level of challenge but need a little more race time on a short track to realistically challenge for top spot? Increase the amount of laps for this event. Racers like the Forza Motorsports series traditionally offer similar scope to increase or decrease the overall challenge before races, but the implementation here is markedly more elegant and nuanced.', ""Project CARS is at its best with evenly matched opponent cars, where every overtake is a small victory and it may take a lap (or several) to set up for a pass, but if you prefer to feel like a hero and blast past the whole pack in two laps from last place on the grid you can do that too. You can ask Project CARS to be either of these extremes and it will instantly oblige. Low-level opponent AI is quite nervous off the start line but, in general, all opponents display good situational awareness and are satisfyingly aggressive without being total bullies. Ive found myself tagged by passing cars only occasionally and, for the most part, opponents seem pleasingly adept at avoiding race incidents. On one occasion I was beaten by a jerk AI driver who (illegally) didnt make his mandatory pit stop until the last lap of a race and won by passing the finish line in pit lane, but its otherwise mostly well behaved. The autodrive needs a little work though; on one occasion I got hung up against some kind of invisible barrier while stopping for tyres at Bathurst but as you don't have manual control during pit stops I couldnt rectify it and had to quit the race."", '\n', 'Project CARS player-first philosophy extends to its meaty career mode too, which is divided across open wheel racing, touring and GT racing, and prototype racing. They key point of difference is that, while there are a series of tiers available in each to progress through, you can start your career wherever youd like. Want to start in karts and work your way up through the various open-wheel racing leagues before you finally land a seat in the top LMP1 league? Not a problem. Rather go straight to the top? Also not a problem. Enjoying your stint in GT4? Re-sign for another season, and another. You dont have to move up if you dont want to. Start where you want, stay where you wish.', 'Its not entirely dissimilar to Codemasters Pro Race Driver games, and the more recent Grid Autosport; the idea is to simply earn drives with various racing teams. Offers for stints in upcoming race seasons from team principals will come through your career email; all you need to do is accept the one you want. The team provides the car, so theres no need to grind for cash or purchase cars. You just need to perform as well as you can over the whole season. I like this as it properly tempted me to challenge myself, and there is a lot more satisfaction to be gleaned from a real dogfight to defend a top-10 finish in Project CARS than there is farming first place trophies for cash in other racing games.', '\n', 'You can also have multiple careers on the boil if you wish. I began my first career in a one-make Renault Clio championship and moved up to GT4 racing, but I wanted a crack at the Endurance racing and LMP1 racing, so I started parallel careers in both of these.', 'The only rigid part of the career mode is the three career goals  Zero to Hero, Triple Crown, and Defending Champ  that are available for you to attain, but its entirely up to you whether you try to achieve them all or focus on one in particular (or none, I guess).', 'A taste of other forms of racing outside your active career(s) is available by diving into Project CARS one-off race weekends. The individual race weekends differ from the events you enter during your career by allowing you to determine things like how the weather will change throughout the race. You can activate several weather slots and choose what will happen in each, as well as how fast the weather will shift. I ran into an odd glitch here in this mode that hasnt occurred elsewhere; it seems to try and place two opponent cars in the same spot on the starting grid. It causes a bit of a fuss but it doesnt ruin proceedings.', 'You get a similar level of control when setting up online races. The online racing has seemed robust and reliable on track during testing, although there are some quirks in the race set-ups that have emerged that will need addressing. In one case, a player that had joined our session after the warm-up period was driving an LMP1 vehicle that drastically outclassed the GT3 cars the rest of us had to choose from in the lobby. Its unclear to me why this was possible.', '\n', 'Project CARS is an extremely handsome racing game across PC, PS4, and Xbox One, but its the little touches I like most. The leaves whipped up in the wake of cars ahead of you. The shards of light stabbing through tree tops obscuring a low-hanging sun, or the bobble of the rubber marbles accumulating just outside the racing line as cars rumble past. Thats a subtle flourish only perceptible in replays but programmed in nonetheless. The effect of rain on windscreens isnt as remarkable as it is in Driveclub (it isnt sloshed around by the wiper blades or cornering/braking forces) but the weather effects overall are great, and the tracks look spectacular in the wet. It makes up for its minor shortfalls (the animated pit stops present in the pre-release builds have been removed for the moment) with some cool attention to detail elsewhere, like the ability to monitor your opponents section and lap times from the garage during qualifying sessions.', 'Project CARS vehicles also ooze detail, and are certainly on par with the competition. The range of vehicles varies across a large number of categories, from GT cars, to Le Mans prototypes, to a smattering of tracks toys, hypercars, and classic racing cars. Most, but not all, are licensed models. Im not quite as smitten with this vehicle roster as, say, the slightly more rounded selection curated for Grid Autosport, but I still found quite a lot to like about it, even though some of the categories are a little less populated than others (and Japanese marques are virtually unrepresented).', '\n', 'That said, the vehicles in Project CARS feel far, far more distinct from one another than the cars of Grid Autosport do. The difference between a purpose-built race car and a regular, road-going hatchback is expertly translated by Project CARS supremely capable handling model. The former feel light, agile, and grippy; theyre stable in corners, but when pushed to the brink they snap in an instant, and it takes a deft touch to rein them in. Road cars feel almost whale-like in comparison. Even a performance hatch like the Focus RS feels heavy and understeers like a pig when you try to wrestle it through bends.', ""The effect is amplified tenfold with a steering wheel, but survives translation on a gamepad too, although I found it worthwhile to play with the controller filtering sensitivity and other settings to find a feel that suits best. Either way, forget the problematic input lag from Slightly Mad Studios previous racer (the otherwise underrated Shift 2: Unleashed). I will say I don't like the karts in Project CARS, though  they're just too frenetic for me."", 'The important thing is Project CARS makes me feel like a racing driver, just like FIFA puts players on the pitch in their favourite football team. When my race engineer told me someone in my virtual pit crew had just fumbled a wheel nut in a particularly time-sensitive stop, seconds felt like hours  as they likely would to a real race driver. Exiting the pits after a botched stop is tricky; I wanted to curse and push hard to try and claw back some time, but was invariably on cold tyres. Its not a good feeling; its annoying, actually. But its not like getting annoyed at a cheap glitch; its a simulation of the kind of pressure on a driver suffering the consequences of a pit lane mistake. Its a new feeling, a realistic one  and its one Ive never had before in a racing game. And that, I appreciate.']",IGN
17,Borderlands: The Handsome Collection,23-Mar-15,Vince Ingenito,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/24/borderlands-the-handsome-collection-review,"[""Sitting down to tear into Borderlands: The Handsome Collection, I couldn't help but be impressed by the sheer volume of content it wraps up: two great action RPG-shooters, 12 well-differentiated playable characters, and hundreds of hours of story and side missions that take you from Pandora to the moon and back again. It's truly an embarrassment of riches."", ""Aside from the 1080p resolution and beefed up textures and lighting effects, nothing has changed here for Borderlands 2 or The Pre-Sequel. They're all just as generous with loot, they still feature some of the best humor in modern gaming, and they both still wield irreverent goofiness like a deadly weapon. For a more detailed sense of why we think these two games are so darn great, check out our full reviews for Borderlands 2, and Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel."", 'Not only do they function wonderfully as shooters, but their gear and skill progression are still some of the best you can find amongst action RPGs, with zany skill trees that still make starting a new character fun even after a few hundred hours. The Pre-Sequel is particularly strong here, with every character having at least one skill tree that requires you to commit to strange playstyles in exchange for big-time power, like constantly reloading to become a whirling dervish of explosive destruction.', ""The issues I have with this package are matters of minor inconvenience more than anything else. For one, once you've chosen which game to boot into, there's no way to switch to the other without closing the application and booting it back up, which is a somewhat inconvenient oversight."", ""Second is slightly inconsistent performance. Borderlands 2 is rock solid whether playing solo or with three friends split screen, but while the Pre-Sequel mostly stays at 60  frames per second in single-player aside from the occasional hitch, in four-player split screen, the frame rate is half that, and sometimes worse. What's more, the skill and inventory screens aren't scaled proportionately with your screen quadrant, so you can only see a slice of these screens at a time. None of this stuff is a deal-breaker, but it does make couch co-op just a bit less enjoyable.""]",IGN
18,Mortal Kombat X,13-Apr-15,Vince Ingenito,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/13/mortal-kombat-x-review,"['Lets just get this out of the way: Mortal Kombat X is the best Mortal Kombat, period. Its deeper, mechanically richer, and more fully featured than any of the nine games before it, hands down. On top of that, developer NetherRealm Studios has taken a bunch of risks by adding eight entirely new characters to the MK roster, while introducing fun, distinct variations to returning ones. Each of these risks pays off to varying degrees, but they also serve to highlight some of the ways in which the franchise is stuck in the past. As a whole, Mortal Kombat X is an excellent fighter, and the most fun Ive ever had with a Mortal Kombat game.', 'The first thing MKX does to make itself feel new and exciting to both old series fans and casual fighters is a major roster shakeup. Before DLC ever enters the picture, MKX sports a respectable 24 fighters, and a whopping one third of those are honest-to-goodness new characters; not palette swaps or tweaked alternate versions of existing ones. Few fighting games with such a deep vault of fan-favorite characters have cleaned house so completely, and MKX is so much the better for it. Sure, I go way back with guys like Kabal and Smoke, but fresh faces like Takeda and Kung Jin bring so much novelty to the table gameplay-wise that its hard to be sad about their absence.', 'Takeda is the most eye-catching new design, and he exemplifies what MKX does right with its new characters. He fights like youd imagine a 21st-century ninja might, with an interesting mix of traditional weaponry and high-tech gadgetry. Hes got remote-controlled laser swords he can plant and recall at will, explosive kunai throwing knives, and arm-mounted, retractable grappling hooks that can open up into imposing blade-covered whips. He wields it all with a confident martial arts swagger that makes it all seem somehow plausible.', 'In fact, everyone conveys their fighting style more effectively than in NetherRealms prior games thanks to the much-improved animations. Injustice was a step in the right direction of addressing the shortcomings of 2011s Mortal Kombat, but MKX gets the rest of the way there: dash and hit animations no longer look like hapless flailing, for instance. Little details like this used to distract me from the fighting all the time, and Im glad to see them finally ironed out.', 'This helps MKX feel like the smoothest-playing Mortal Kombat ever. Walk speeds are snappier, pokes feel more useful, and with the awesome new variation system that gives each character three possible abilities to choose from at the beginning of a match, theres more to explore, discover, and exploit than ever before. Liu Kang has a variation where he can switch on the fly between healing and damaging stances, new grappler Torr employs an assist character to double-team opponents, Kotal Khan can place totems to grant himself temporary buffs  this is the kind of stuff you usually see in games like Persona 4 or BlazBlue, and seeing NetherRealms open up so many fun new doors is really refreshing.', 'One mild distraction from the excellent combat is the visual inconsistency between characters. Some fighters, like Scorpion or newcomer Dvorah, look excellent, with tons of little details in their faces and costumes. Others, like Sonya and Jacqui, look far less detailed, with comparatively plain facial textures. It stands out because of the high peaks MKX hits during its best moments. With two of the better-looking fighters duking it out against one of the many beautiful backgrounds, this is one of the best-looking console games around, so it sticks out when everything isnt up to the same high quality level.', 'The inconsistency that sticks out the most for me, though, is the content of MKXs so-so story mode, and how completely at odds it is with the dark and gruesome aesthetic Mortal Kombat has built over the years. Again, NetherRealms has created something substantial for folks who like a single-player experience, but its far less successful than previous attempts when it comes to providing a meaningful context for the bloody brawls. The spotty writing and voice acting are largely to blame, but the real issue is that its weaving a tale of family and young adults coming of age in a world about death and brutality. Without the storytelling wit to do something interesting and unpredictable, its simply a poor fit.', 'The chapters set in a civil war-torn Outworld fit the Mortal Kombat tone the best, but there is just no reconciling the feel-good tale of a single father who loves his daughter in story mode with the image of him gleefully tearing a hole in her chest and proudly standing over her fresh corpse in every other mode. Yes, of course, Mortal Kombat is ostensibly about Fatalities, and theyre gorier and more satisfying here than ever, but MKXs story mode also wants to be about characters with deep ties to one another: fathers and sons, estranged lovers, budding romance, and long-standing blood-feuds finally laid to rest. Adding all of that drama to a series that began as a thrown-together story of a bunch of loners fighting to their deaths for their own reasons in strange, dangerous-feeling places leaves MKX feeling a bit confused in that regard.', '\n', 'Theres a small bit of this inner conflict in the excellent combat engine as well, but fortunately it matters far less. The bi-directional block button is back, and after being free of it in Injustice it simply feels limiting to come back. Scream sacrilege! all youd like; the block button is a poor mechanic. It completely removes the left/right mixup that cross-ups are supposed to create in 2D fighters, eliminating an entire axis of mind games and setups without offering anything interesting in return.', 'Still, theres a ton to sink your teeth into here. Each character has a long list of attacks and combo chains that serve different purposes, from high/low mixups to safe block strings and juggle starters. X-Rays, the MK equivalent of super moves, have been retuned to be more worth the resources they cost to execute, and throws can be canceled out of and linked into full combos, giving you another meaningful way to spend meter. This makes resource management decisions that much richer. Most importantly, the ability to choose between three version of every character means there will be more matchup-specific stuff to learn, since playing against Sonyas martial arts-focused Special Forces variant wont prepare you for the oki setups she can create with her Demolitions style.', 'Thats what really matters in the end. Sure, the three or four-hour story mode experience feels middling and largely out of place, but story mode isnt really what a fighting game is about. Its endless nights in the lab and the joy of outsmarting your opponent in single combat. MKX provides all this with an incrementally improved version of the same great training mode from Injustice, and a solid suite of online features. The best of these is King of the Hill, which allows you to queue up and chat with a bunch of players while training, watching live matches, and paying respect for performances that impress you. Its a fun, social way to play and learn with other people.', 'The netcode is mostly up to the task of keeping online fights reasonably smooth, but there was usually just enough input lag to throw off my combos or punish timings relative to what Im used to playing locally. Still, thats a huge improvement over Mortal Kombat 9, and while online isnt a replacement for in-person competition, its close enough to keep me learning and playing for a long time.', 'One more thing that will keep me coming back is the returning Krypt, where you unlock MKXs humorously massive cadre of costumes, finishers, and supplemental materials. More than ever before, this interactive unlockable menu feels like a game of its own. Theres a certain thrill to spending your hard-earned koins to open up treasure chests that could have anything in them.', 'That joy is somewhat dampened by the knowledge that you can just buy your way out of the entire thing with a separate $20 unlock key. Its not the only thing thats been monetized, sadly: new options for executing easy, two-button Fatalities or skipping story or tower fights require tokens, which are also sold on PSN and XBL. Its worth noting I never felt outright pushed to get any of this stuff, but between all that and the big push X to buy Goro message that appears when you cursor over him on the character-select screen, its a bit too much in-game marketing for me to be okay with. It didnt impact my enjoyment of the experience exactly, but even a hair more aggressive, and it would have. Its sad that were even in that territory.']",IGN

Capcoms horror doesn't frighten, but as an action-adventure its elevated by this occasional synergy, and the excellent bonus Raid mode."", 'Revelations 2s four episodes dance between two timelines, each with its own pair of characters, to weave together a mystery that kept me hooked right up until its finale. In one, reliably endearing Claire Redfield and tude-filled Moira Burton - who I also liked, despite her tendency to swear for the sake of swearing -  are two unlikely friends, thrust together by an evil overseer who is keeping them captive for reasons unknown.', 'Resident Evil fan-favourite Barry Burton is back in the second timeline, joined by mysterious newcomer Natalia, a little girl whose memory harbors half-remembered secrets. Each episode manages to keep its cards close enough to its chest that I was compelled to play the next one  perhaps the only justification for Revelations 2s four-episode structure  and theres a humour in the characters that I found refreshing.', 'Pairing off these characters does more than serve the story, though, as your companions are legitimately useful in ways that make gameplay more interesting. Moiras flashlight is used to blind enemies and find hidden objects for Claire, and Natalia can see enemy weakpoints and crawl through tiny spaces where Barry cant fit.', 'Revelations 2 is at its best when it makes us use all these skills at once. Its most satisfying moments involve switching between characters on the fly - or shrieking instructions at your partner if playing in split-screen or online co-op - in order to make it through particularly tricky or dangerous areas.', 'Both Natalia and Moira are physically underpowered, too, which can lend to a sense of hysteria. Theres a thrilling section in Episode 3, for example, where Moira and Claire must escape an enemy-filled building by working together against the clock. Moira cant defend herself against giant enemies, so youve either got to make a run for it or youve got to switch to Claire and pump bullets into them from afar.', 'I would have liked to have seen more of this kind of co-op play across the board, but unfortunately Revelations 2s biggest sin is its boring corridor environments.Theres a significant lack of environmental detail here - unbreakable crates is as spicy as it generally gets - and its crumbling interiors are painted in far less than 50 shades of grey.', 'Equally unimaginative enemies roam them. While there are a handful that stand out - Claire faces off against a deliciously gross monster at the end of episode 3, while the final boss will likely inspire fan-art - most enemies are generic shamblers or walking pustules with glowing red spots. In 2015, these monsters arent only played out - theyre simply not scary.', 'Fortunately, traditional Resident Evil puzzles do eventually spice things up, after a conspicuous absence in the first few episodes. Episode 3 introduces some classic brain-benders, including one that involves Barry and Natalia working together to move a box from one end of a level to another. Its all nonsense, of course - the justification is that the giant box is an outdoor power source - but it incorporates some clever level design and provides a nice break from the running and gunning.', 'Theres far more consistency outside the main campaign. The Raid minigame is a highlight, played either solo or co-op. Raid mode challenges you to clear out a huge number of shooting galleries under the recommended level without healing yourself, offering bragging rights and unlockable characters as a reward. At 130 medals down, Ive only scratched the surface, yet Im compelled to continue: Raid offers real longevity outside of the main campaign.']",IGN

In Mario Party mode, you only play a minigame if you land on a minigame space  and theyre rare enough that it's entirely possible to play an entire game without hitting one.\nMinilame!"", '', '', 'Bowser Party not only introduces a fifth player to the party, but also makes use of the Wii U GamePad  a fittingly large controller for the role of Bowser as master party crasher.', 'In this mode, up to four players share a car and roll dice to flee from Bowser on one of three boards shared with Mario Party mode (two are unavailable for some reason) while Bowser rolls a handful of dice in an attempt to catch up at the end of each turn. If Bowser catches up, he takes on the four other players in a 1v4 minigame. Interestingly, these games are balanced individually to favor either Bowser or the partiers. As Bowser gets more ""angry"" throughout a match, the minigames you play will be tilted in his favor.', ""Playing as Bowser is a blast: You blow fire at scurrying players; mess with their minds by rotating and stopping a giant wheel that throws them into flames; and officiate a game of BINGO that the partiers pretty much always lose. You do all this with your own screen and set of controls, so others can't see your scheming. I highly recommend the submarine game board, where the Bowser player gets to draw on the GamePad to try and trick players into choosing the wrong path on the big screen. You don't actually have that much psychological sway, but taunting with GamePad graffiti is totally gratifying."", ""Whether you are Bowser or not, this five-person modification of Mario Party is 10's greatest achievement  and one of the best uses of the Wii U GamePad yet."", '', '', ""Amiibo Party requires Nintendo's interactive toys (amiibo), but amiibo aren't exactly the life of the party. Each player must keep an amiibo and a Wii Remote on hand at all times, with the GamePad sitting at some place within reach of all players (which was awkward both in my living room and in the office)."", ""The integration of amiibo amounts to little more than constantly tapping the figures to a sensor in the corner of the GamePad. You tap to roll, tap to stop random spinners, tap to use items... You tap the GamePad a lot. In between amiibo tapping, you play an old-school version of Mario Party: You get to move as separate characters (yay!), and there's a minigame after each round (yay!), but there's a huge catch: The game boards in this mode are small, linear, squares. You can swap out corners of the squares with different Mario themes, but they left me and my fellow partiers yawning. And tapping.\n"", '', ""Lurking in Mario Party 10's bonus menu is a great standalone game called Jewel Drop, which captivated the office for a few hours one day. It's a clever color-matching game not unlike Dr. Mario, but with a spin: Physics apply.

21,Titan Souls,13-Apr-15,Brandin Tyrrel,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/13/titan-souls-review,"['With no more than a bow and a single arrow, Titan Souls nameless child protagonist is a pure symbol of skill over style. Hes a small, barefoot, and seemingly insignificant David in the 16-bit shadows cast by the many hulking Golaiths that tower over him. And fittingly, just like the two-dimensional sprite of this boy, Titan Souls is itself an unassuming and short expression of mechanical excellence. Though the sparse fiction of its fantasy world takes a backseat to the exacting top-down arcade-style boss battles, felling the gargantuan creatures with feats of precision is an intense gauntlet where one mistake means instant death. Titan Souls great challenge is mastering these arenas and besting your own past performances in a game of escalating difficulty  and its a greatly rewarding experience.', 'The spartan nature of Titan Souls is best summed up by the way it demands that you make every shot count. You have a bow and the ability to fire one single arrow  the longer you draw the bow, the further and faster the arrow travels  but the farther you shoot it, the tougher it is to retrieve and reuse. You can walk, run, or roll to go pick it up, or use your Force-like will to pull it back to you (at the cost of planting your feet). Thats it. This is your entire toolkit when tackling creatures that spit fire, swing boulder-sized maces, and conjure all sorts of lethal magical forces.', 'And though scant in ways to interact with the world, whats here is snappy and fluid. I always felt as nimble and precise as the boy on screen appears, which is necessary when youre running for your fragile life while waiting for that golden window to appear. The simplicity is refreshing, as it scoops out the fat that so many games layer on with so many variables and strategies.', 'Here, there is only one strategy: Learn where to fire your arrow and practice until you hit your mark. Each clash with the varied range of titans is excellently engaging, forcing you to learn their movement patterns, attacks, environments, and weak spots where a well-placed arrow undoes their imposing stature. And as if these hulks were goading you into their grasp, the glowing chinks in their armor are almost always plainly visible, yet painstaking to reach in the ensuing maelstrom of attacks that will snuff you out on contact. Victory is always just an arrow away.', 'Its fortunate that these engagements are so creative and meticulously constructed, because the experience is generally devoid of anything else. The world proper is very much a hub that non-linearly connects the usual suspects of fantasy environments: the lava region, the snow area, the forest section, and their appropriately themed encounters. However, there are no minions or monsters to slay en route to a boss fight, so while the 16-bit-style art is endearing, theres little to really see or discover beyond the caves, paths, and stairways that lead toward your next bout with a titan.', 'That same scarcity applies to the very loose story that ties it all together. Its told through a few ambiguous cutscenes, cryptic murals etched into stone, and a single encounter that offers some narrative pseudo-explanation. Titan Souls is less a world in which one can get lost and more an obstacle course of mechanically challenging boss battles, though the superbly soothing acoustic strings that create its soundtrack make the repeated trek between fights much more enjoyable.', 'But as so much of Titan Souls is trial and error, and death comes so quickly and repeatedly, developer Acid Nerve has wisely scattered checkpoints throughout the smaller environments, minimizing what could otherwise be an immensely tedious journey back to an encounter. I found one or two battles to still be a noticeable shade too far from their respective checkpoints  a 10 to 15-second run  but the majority of the fights are helpfully just a few seconds away after death, which I absolutely appreciated when a titan ostensibly had my number.', 'Yet through perseverance and improvement, I conquered all of Titan Souls nearly two dozen titular beings in approximately four hours. And with all said and done, I admit to wishing there were more of these creative engagements to test myself against  thats less a slight toward Titan Souls and more a symptom of the great satisfaction to be enjoyed from each victory.', 'It doesnt end that quickly, though; this is a game thats meant to be replayed, and replayed again, though due to the lack of randomization, the means by which it refreshes itself may only intrigue the most dedicated players. Once completed, you restart the same crucible to beat your tracked clear time with a smaller number of deaths, doing it faster and more efficiently each time. Modifiers like Hard Mode  which recycles each fights formula but ramps up the speed and difficulty  along with the aptly named No Rolls mode, and Iron Mode where a single death restarts the game, slightly extend the experience, but only for those who want to conquer their own imperfect reflexes as much as the titans.', '', '', 'PlayStation 4 Version', ""The current-gen console version of Titan Souls is as great as the PC version in every technical way. Additionally, the fact that Titan Souls almost requires controller support means that the PS4 version automatically comes with the intended control peripheral. However, if you're a bigger fan of a non-Sony, third-party controller then PC is a totally comparable experience."", ""The addition of the Share button on PS4 is actually incredibly useful for Titan Souls. As titans will occasionally crumple in mere seconds thanks to a one-in-a-million shot, now you can save those moments forever. And you should, because it's quite possible they'll never happen again."", '', '', 'PS Vita', ""Of the current three versions of Titan Souls available, the PlayStation Vita is my least favorite. Though technically fine and on par with the console and PC offerings (outside of some noticeably small text on the main menu), the smaller scale is certainly noticeable. While it may not be an issue for every game, a game like Titan Souls, ostensibly about firing arrows at exact angles to hit extremely small targets, suffers under the reduction in size. I found the precision of combat to take a hit, but otherwise it's an equally fine and functional portable alternative in every other way.""]",IGN
22,Final Fantasy: Record Keeper,1-Apr-15,Meghan Sullivan,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/01/final-fantasy-record-keeper-review,"['Its been over 20 years since I first encountered Final Fantasy IVs Mist Dragon, but I still remembered that attacking it when it turns into vapor is as futile as punching air. So when she pulled this trick again in Final Fantasy: Record Keeper I ordered my party to defend themselves and wait; the moment the dragon re-emerged, I ordered the dragoon Kain to perform his signature Double Jump move, then had Cloud finish it off with a heavy sword blow. Yes, Cloud. That burst of novelty and nostalgia makes this free-to-play turn-based RPG for mobile devices briefly entertaining, though it began to fade away as I realized that Record Keeper has little depth or breadth.', 'Record Keeper relies heavily on fans knowledge of Final Fantasy lore, and doesnt waste much time with plot or character development. In doing so, it ends up being a bland presentation of what we know are actually interesting people and places. Each Final Fantasy realm is represented by nothing but a numbered door, and the magical paintings that represent a realms story are just screenshots with a brief summary of events below them. Theres no world exploration and very little character interaction, which made Record Keepers world and characters feel strangely nebulous. I was especially disappointed that I couldnt unlock videos of iconic moments from each Final Fantasy, because I would have loved to see Yuna sending souls to the Far Plane (FFX) or re-watch the epic battle between Alexander and Bahamut (Final Fantasy IX).', 'The warm, fuzzy feeling of nostalgia is much stronger when I actually get into combat. Enemies and allies are all adorably pixelated in the style of 16-bit era Final Fantasy games, with music for each realm matching the game its from. Enemies and allies trade blows as soon as their attack meters fill up (the signature feature of Final Fantasys classic Active Time Battle system).  Theres also some nice touches of nuance available, such as equipping characters like Kain and Rydia with armor and weapons from their native Final Fantasy IV and sending them into that games battles, which gave me useful stat boosts while conjuring up pleasant memories of them teaming up to defeat the evil Golbez.', 'Enemies within each realm retain their unique behaviors and abilities (warning boards from FFVII are still invulnerable to lightning, wererats from VI still love to bite, etc.) which helped me come up with an effective battle plan because I knew what was coming. For instance, I made sure to have a Black Mage in my party when I entered an area of Final Fantasy IV I knew was filled with fire-fearing zombies. And it was fun mixing and matching characters from old and new Final Fantasies to see how their abilities meshed; I thought Clouds Soul Break and Kains Double Jump worked particularly well together.  Unfortunately, without world exploration and interaction between party members to break things up, combat began to feel pretty repetitive fairly quickly.', 'The only other significant thing you can do in Record Keeper is customize weapons and abilities using gold and materials dropped on the battlefield. Having to decide whether to spend precious black orbs to create elemental spells, or whether to combine two low-grade spears to make a stronger one was a welcome challenge, but waiting for enemies to drop enough orbs and materials to do so was a test of patience. So too was being tethered by a limited amount of stamina, which I needed to fight my way through each realm. The only way to get additional stamina was to wait for it to replenish, spend mythril found on the battlefield...or flat out pay for it.', 'Because yes, this is a free-to-play game, and it was pretty obvious throughout that Square Enix was gently nudging me to spend cash to access better equipment and more stamina points. Luckily, its never too pushy about it, and there wasnt anything I couldnt access for free eventually. Plus, daily login bonuses and dungeon challenges gave me just enough gil and material each day that I could press forward, and special events let me recruit popular characters like Tifa and Sephiroth to my party. I appreciated the amount of content at my fingertips--Record Keeper features tons of weapons, armor, enemies and allies--I just wanted it all a little faster.']",IGN
23,Bloodborne,23-Mar-15,Brandin Tyrrel,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/23/bloodborne-review,"['Theres incredible power to Bloodborne. Its not just an amazing dance of dodges and swipes through encounters that often push the limits of reflexes and endurance, its a thought-provoking experience thats wormed its way into my mind and melted my resolve. But through perseverance, patient growth, and determined skill, its proved itself an unconventional adventure that ultimately gives much more than it takes  which at times can be a staggering cost. By the end, the only frustrations that dont turn to triumphs are the technical ones. After more than 60 hours of grappling with its terrors, monsters, and the environment itself, Im left dumbfounded by Bloodbornes capability to draw powerful emotions from me, and make me earn the successes that Ill remember for years to come.', 'Its unconventional approach to action-RPG gameplay walks a fine line between utter elation and despair as it takes us on an awe-inspiring journey through the highest peaks of satisfaction and the deepest, blackest pits of exhausted desperation. Developer From Software chooses to tell us little about how to survive its gauntlet, and yet expects feats of intelligence and perseverance in the face of its brutal, unrelenting difficulty. That balance is slightly upset by painfully long loading screens upon death or travel to different zones, but the highs of taking down one of the many intimidating bosses make up for those chunks of downtime.', ""Bloodbornes semi-open world structure and hard-earned progression draw heavily from the Dark Souls and Demon's Souls games that made From famous, though the aggressive new pace of combat is all its own. These diving, rolling melee battles with an awesome arsenal of transforming melee weapons and tactical sidearms chiseled away my calluses and made me form new ones, even as a hardened Dark Souls veteran. Switching weapons between their light and heavy modes on the fly to string together combo-like attack chains in an engaging way injects a newfound versatility, even if its a less calculating kind of battle than we see in Froms earlier games."", 'That doesnt make it any easier, though. Being overwhelmed by enemies is commonplace, but thanks to your ability to leech back lost health with quick counterattacks and to stun opponents with secondary weapons, I found its possible to sustain a constant onslaught when Id built up enough skill.', 'And these tools are absolutely needed, as Bloodbornes horrifying beasts span an imaginative range, from pedestrian insane village folk to cosmic horrors and patchwork fiends. Creature design strikes terror in many ways  enormous axe-swinging skeletons, peculiar semi-transparent childlike creatures, and subtle creepiness, like a coven of wailing, cleaver wielding hags  but each entity is well-crafted and triumphantly threatening. Thats best exemplified by the bosses, which have the power to mystify, terrify, and infuriate. I ultimately found many of those big fights much simpler than getting past the trial-and-error battles with dozens of smaller enemies I fought to reach them, but the satisfaction in each and every victory was huge.', 'The progression that follows those hard-fought wins is a carefully doled-out treat in Bloodborne. For one thing, the glowing pale purple lamps that serve as its version of checkpoints are scarce. Surviving long enough to reach the next point is rarely an option you can count on, but delving out of your comfort zone to find a secret shortcut back to safety brings a wave of comfort. Unfortunately, the inability to warp between these lamps without a layover back to the Hunters Dream (your ethereal-feeling home base) is a needless annoyance that exacerbates the issue with the extended load times.', 'After arriving at a destination, nearly every careful, blood-soaked step through the consistently stunning environments reveals something new about Bloodbornes vague and cryptic lore. Whispers and clues are everywhere, begging to be interpreted. Despite a frame rate that all too often buckles under the strain of loading new areas or heavy action, the atmosphere retains its full effect. Theres a sense that this strange and dark place is alive. You could find a subtext of criticisms on real-world concepts like faith and worship in the understated dialogue, but taking each outrageously odd story point at face value is the more enjoyable path.', 'Yet your personal story will be created on your own terms, as you explore the spiderweb of paths and secrets that crisscross Bloodbornes potent world. Everything is packed with hidden meaning, and spending time speaking with the forgotten citizens of the eerily rotting city of Yharnam yields new ways to interact with the world. At one point, I spoke with a victim of these dark circumstances who gifted me a family heirloom that seemed inconsequential at the time; it wasnt until I took the time to read its description that it suddenly became a vital tool in a battle to come. Rewards in Bloodborne come with careful examination and curious effort, and I wouldnt have it any other way.', 'Theres so much to do and see and try here that I obsessed over finding every secret, which greatly extends Bloodbornes already lengthy playtime  though that number can easily be extended in a New Game Plus, or the refreshing procedurally generated Chalice Dungeons. These areas arent just more of the same  theyre loaded with items that can be carried back into the main story, exclusive weapons and bosses, and the player-versus-environment replayability that the Souls series was always missing.', 'And though Bloodborne is mostly an isolating and solitary experience, subtle cooperative elements enhance that in fascinating ways. Spotting (non-interactive) ghostly shades of other players passing through your area, reading warnings and tips left by people who have come before, and studying reenactments of player deaths by activating prompts on the ground all serve as cautionary tales  immensely helpful in avoiding surprises that would otherwise leap out and kill you.', 'Though these features are all mostly identical to their earlier iterations in Dark Souls, some things have improved. The best addition to the messaging system is the inclusion of emotes that spring to life like a hologram when someone reads the message. On the lowest rung of Old Yharnam, in a grimey alleyway corner, I used the available pick-and-choose word selection to lay down the message: item waits ahead, but beware ambush, then aimed and added the point emote for a visual indicator to point to where a killer waited in the shadows. According to the rating system, its been very helpful to others, and thats a great feeling. I saved lives.', 'As far as cooperative multiplayer, Bloodborne is every bit as obtuse as Dark Souls ever was. It allows you to call for help from another player when you need it most, such as a boss fight that feels like a brick wall or a group of enemies you dont feel confident in taking on alone, by ringing a Beckoning Bell; any players ringing a response bell in the area will warp into your world. The catch (since theres always a catch in Bloodborne) is that at the same time, you open yourself up to invasion from hostile players that are actively seeking to hunt and kill other hunters. In a rare move of compassion, this time around From has wisely included a password-protected game feature so that you and a friend can connect deliberately, removing some of the ambiguity of anonymous cooperation.']",IGN

While it doesnt stand out enough from the main game to prove essential, it does offer beautiful Lost World-esque environments to explore, some tough new challenges, and a story that adds an interesting, if surprisingly low-key, dynamic to the Dragon Age universe.', 'Jaws of Hakkon introduces a sun-dappled region studded with fairy-tale mushrooms, prehistoric nasties, and tropical birds known as Frostback Basin. Not only is this addition one of the Inquisition maps most immediately beautiful terrains, its got a fair bit of design depth to it, too. As I galloped my way through it, I was treated to a wide variety of locales; a muddy, foggy swamp, twisted, dizzying tree trunks twisted into pathways, and little villages where I began the quests that would occupy me for a good five or six hours.', '\n', 'While I found the basic thrust of these overly familiar  Find X to complete the quest! Kill Y to complete the quest! Oh no, Z is mysteriously missing!  Jaws of Hakkon provides an interesting context to give each more relevance. It turns out that the Frostback Basin is being terrorized by fevered fanatics of the God of Hakkon, which causes trouble for your Inquisitor as you search for the final resting place of the last Inquisitor, missing in the region for 800 years.', 'Its a surprisingly impersonal story  your Inquisitor status is rather meaningless, and while your party returns with their signature vibrance, they merely provide background colour  but at the very least, it highlights developer BioWares skill at world-building. Theres a real sense of history here between the Hakkonites and Avaar who live in the region, and their traditions and rituals have been obviously created with a great deal of thought and imagination.', 'Jaws of Hakkon also gives a bit more screentime to one of Inquistions most endearing characters: Scout Harding. While she remains characteristically professional, Harding  and her wonderful voice actress Ali Hillis  reveal a little more of her heart here, and Jaws of Hakkon is a more touching story for it.', 'It helps that Inqusitions sense of humour is dryer than ever in this DLC. While I wouldnt dare recommend one party member over the rest (ahem  Dorian), Hakkons banter game is strong, and some of the characters youll meet have some fantastic one-liners that made me genuinely laugh  always a tough feat in the frequently ultra-serious fantasy RPG genre.', '\n', 'The lightness is particularly appreciated later on, when Jaws of Hakkon ramps up the difficulty to a teeth-clenching degree. For those even at a highish level  I began at 22  theres real challenge to be found here. The more I explored the region, the more Hakkonites swamped me in numbers, and the Pride Demons at fade rifts grew more relentless.', 'For the most part I welcomed the sudden upturn in difficulty, particularly as Id begun to take my power for granted after 60 or so hours of Inquisititing. The exception is that I would have liked the option to have changed my party composition at a certain brutal point in the late game, where a combination of inexplicable finality on BioWares part and poor-decision making on mine almost cost me six hours of progress. My advice? Manually save  and do it often.']",IGN

With RBI Baseball 15, I knew a championship wasn't in the cards after my second at-bat."", ""After David Murphy started my first exhibition as the New York Mets against the Boston Red Sox with a blistering single that almost reached The Green Monster, a sacrifice bunt by Michael Cuddyer led to a phantom out on first despite the fielder never tagging the runner or touching first. The rest of that game went without catastrophe, but that goof-up put an asterisk next to the result. Pretty much every subsequent has game mirrored that initial outing; while I'd go multiple innings at a time enjoying the decent (if shallow) arcade-style hardball, sooner or later a glitch or gross misrepresentation of the MLB experience would sour my attitude."", ""To its credit, the on-field experience in RBI 15 has improved dramatically. (Though given how deficient last years RBI Baseball 14 is in terms of gameplay options, thats a fairly low bar to clear.) If you prefer a static ball-height indicator that shows where a ball will land over RBI's default moving target that expands and contracts based on height, you now have an option. If you prefer mapping throws to each base to the corresponding face buttons on your controller instead of last year's inaccurate option of pressing a spot on the d-pad to correspond with the base while pressing the throw button, you can do that. There's a few more minor additions too, like the ability to choose between moving an individual baserunner or all players at once, and varying pitch speed by pressing up or down in conjunction with the throw, and the end result is a slightly more enjoyable day at the ballpark than last season."", ""But wait, there are more glitches to rain out your fun! I've discovered some sort of Bermuda Triangle on the pitcher's mound where no AI opponent can pick up the ball (and I couldn't move onto the next batter unless I took advantage of the glitch and had all baserunners score). There's no manual button for diving to catch a ball, which can be frustrating when a ball runs millimeters from a fielder's grasp. Errors only occur when fielding, never throwing or catching throws, which makes it weird when outfielders consistently nail pin-point throws to home base from anywhere but the warning track. Starting pitchers still tire too easily, rarely making it into the sixth inning, even when I was extremely conservative with fastballs and rarely went deep into counts."", ""Roster management is midway between the Mendoza Line and All-Star status. Its improved over the miserable RBI Baseball 14s missing stat tracking, but its still lacking. While I was able to get well into the first month of the New York Mets' 2015 campaign by keeping my players atop the league leader lists, managing my bullpen to keep relievers fresh, and tweaking my lineup to maximize production from the best of my bench, its shortcomings soon became obvious. Without the ability to trade players or having to worry about injury (or even fatigue for non-pitchers), I wasn't long before I grew tired of my simple 25-man squad. While there are hints in the UI that there will be roster updates (only the mobile version of RBI Baseball 14 had any last year), right now RBI Baseball 15 is still playing catch-up with games I played 20 years ago.""]",IGN
26,Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel -- Claptastic Voyage,20-Mar-15,Vince Ingenito,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/20/borderlands-the-pre-sequel-claptastic-voyage-review,"['You never know what youre going to get with one of Borderlands many, many DLC expansions. Some of them inherit the wrong things from their big sibling, but Claptastic Voyage is the other way around. It trims out nearly all of the excessive backtracking and pacing problems that Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel struggles with, and introduces a wonderfully whimsical setting that brings out the best in the Borderlands playstyle, and in its most recognizable character.', 'Much like Tiny Tinas Assault on Dragon Keep does for Borderlands 2, Claptastic Voyage moves the Vault Hunters exploits into an imaginary realm that enables it to tell a very personal story. At the same time, its a delightful departure from Pandoras traditional trappings (to whatever degree you find masked, homicidal little people and robots who transform into pirate ships traditional). Here, its a digital recreation of Claptraps notoriously scattered mind instead of Tinas D&D fantasy world, but the setup is equally ripe with potential, and Claptastic Voyage dutifully makes the most of it, both in terms of gameplay and story content.', 'Being set in a digital, Matrix-like world has upsides; Claptastic Voyages environments are basically interesting abstractions of the inner workings of software, or of Claptraps memories, both of which are strange and entertaining in their own ways. Zipping from place to place on neon-colored data streams is a Tron-era fantasy few modern games have realized, for instance, and seeing code glitches and memory degradation made manifest as obstacles or objectives makes Claptastic Voyage feel refreshingly unlike any other piece of Borderlands weve seen so far. It feels chaotic and alien, but definitely cool and even thoughtful - especially when it treads into deeper waters.', 'It doesnt tug on the heartstrings quite as artfully as Dragon Keep, but Claptastic Voyage does shine some light on Claptraps inner workings, making him something more than the silly, wisecracking robot hes been to us for the last six years - though, not much more. Its actually for the best, though. Trying too hard to make us care too deeply for such a light-hearted character could have backfired, but the writers knew where to pump the brakes. They somehow managed to make watching Claptraps struggle with self-hatred both entertaining and sweet. The result is a character I can still laugh with, but also, for the first time in the series, connect to.', 'Story and characters aside, Claptastic Voyage iterates on the low-gravity shenanigans of The Pre-Sequel very well while adding more new twists. For instance, Volatile Bits are essentially floating clusters of polygons, that either heal you or deal big damage to surrounding enemies, depending on what color they are when you shoot them them. Theyre one-and-done, so you need to consider when to burn them carefully  and the fact that they might be a different color the moment you eventually do makes it an interesting decision.', 'The new glitched weapon mods change things up too. Every time you reload a glitched weapon, theres a random chance of it being modified in one of a few crazy ways, like huge single-target damage at the expense of massive kickback. Some effects arent as dramatic as others, and itd be nice if those subtle effects were made more clear and useful, but much like Claptraps randomized VaultHunter.exe action skill, they introduce a fun shot of chaos into the already-hectic firefights. Theyre fun to mess with, but not practical enough that I wanted to use them in my main playthrough. I ended up going back to old bread-and-butters when the going got tough.', 'Said firefights are even more dynamic here than in The Pre-Sequel, thanks to a slew of new enemies with new attacks and behaviors. The couple of boss fights are the ultimate expressions of this: neither leans on existing enemy types or waves of minions, opting instead to project digital clones of themselves or bring a varied arsenal of massive weapons to bear. Even the reskinned, rezzed-out bandits have some new tricks up their sleeves. Some will unpredictably teleport around you, suicide bombers will reconstruct themselves after blowing up, and Trojans can lock you down when you attempt to take to the air.', '\n\n', '', 'Speaking of, its a little silly that theres low gravity in a digital recreation of memories that take place on Pandora, but the level designs make such good use of The Pre-Sequels traversal tricks, I had a hard time caring about the logistical leaps involved. Where The Pre-Sequel sometimes feels like exploring a standard Borderlands environment but with longer, slower jumps, Claptastic Voyage is filled with neat little platforming challenges that make getting from point A to B far more enjoyable. Soaring effortlessly through the air feels more like a superpower than a gimmick here.', 'Thats also due to the superior pacing and general lack of backtracking. In Claptastic Voyage I was almost always moving forward figuratively, not just literally, in that Im not wasting tons of time running in circles with little to do while hunting switches. It still does the this switch/door/bridge is broken so go find stuff to unlock/fix it thing a couple of times too many, but on the whole, it isnt an issue. Ive often said that Borderlands would be better served as a more linear experience, and Claptastic Voyage stands as a great example of why. It achieves scale and freedom of movement without all the pointless wandering.', '\n\n', '', 'Though it doesnt sport a raid boss, theres plenty of content here too. Using my borderline-broken Claptrap build, I tore through in three or four hours without touching a sidequest. Doing those was at least another couple of hours, making Claptastic Voyage one of the most substantial add-ons the series has seen. On top of that, going through again on True Vault Hunter difficulty will net you a different set of voiceovers for a new twist on the story (just like Pre-Sequel does).']",IGN

Although it takes a good stab at doing so, it loses much of its charm along the way, and some extra-creaky gameplay adds up to make the finale the the least satisfying episode of the entire series.', 'The story this time around is told with po-faced sincerity, to its detriment. All humour is gone, replaced by unintentionally silly theatrics (I am a god! Come out from behind the glass so I can choke a god!). It reminded me of the clunkier dialogue in the original Resident Evil; funny, considering all the knowing winks and nudges toward that game in earlier episodes.', 'Worse, in an attempt to explain the complexities of the plot at the last minute, developer Capcom has taken to heavy-handed exposition via notes and additional reading material. Not only do we find an open diary revealing our villainous masterminds innermost thoughts, theres a manifesto lying about in her lair titled Hatred of (character X) followed by reasons why she hates (character X). Resident Evil has never been subtle - which is arguably part of its charm - but this is clumsy.', 'Fortunately, theres a breathless pace to Moira and Claires chapter that leaves little room to linger on the issue. Its a single escape sequence that requires you to battle invisible enemies and work cooperatively against the clock, and while its not the most challenging of chapters, it begins and ends with a couple of big story moments that add to a sense of high stakes.', 'The same cant be said for Barry and Natalias chapter, which drags. While the section on a crane is a standout, most of the experience was totally forgettable, involving lots of walking back and forth, moving carts, and fighting the same clutch of enemies I killed last episode  including the same crummy boss. It doesnt help that chunks of their chapter take place in poisonous gas, so I was doing much of this while listening to the pair cough in a non-stop loop.', 'Its a pace that carries on into the final boss battle. While Capcoms artists have clearly had a ball here  the final form of the Overseer is the most delightfully gross monster in Revelations 2  its a lengthy slog of a fight, and one with a surprising lack of any real challenge in Survival Mode.', 'Still, the endings (a good one and a bad one) do clear up some of Revelations 2s mysteries, even if its a case of piling more on as a lead-in to a sequel. The two bonus episodes, Little Miss and The Struggle fill in further gaps, and more, theyre nice little compact stories in themselves.', '\n', 'If youre still playing the excellent Raid mode, Resident Evil Revelations 2s shooting-gallery minigame, every gauntlet and character (including Alex) is now available to unlock. I continue to be impressed with the breadth  and addictiveness  of Raid mode, which extends Revelations 2a shelf-life well after the credits roll.']",IGN
28,Xenoblade Chronicles,2-Apr-15,Jose Otero,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/02/xenoblade-chronicles-3d-review,"['When we first reviewed Xenoblade Chronicles for Wii in 2012, we called it an amazing game. Heres what we said then:', ""Xenoblade Chronicles is the best Japanese RPG of this generation. The fact that it looks like it's from the last generation is its only drawback, but its technical limitations are offset by imaginative artistic direction, innovative and compelling combat, and thoughtful design. It's a throwback to the glory days of the genre, proof that there are always new ways to tell a story. If you've ever felt neglected by the lack of in-depth gaming epics on the Wii, you owe it to yourself to buy this."", 'So how does the port of this epic RPG made exclusively for New Nintendo 3DS stack up? It still offers the same innovative ideas, deep combat, and an expansive world full of quests to complete for well over 60 hours of play, but its a little harder to look at.', 'Developer Monster Games has done an admirable job compressing Xenoblades grand world into a compact form, with only the textures noticeably suffering in the transition to a smaller, low-resolution screen. The downside is that some characters and environments just dont look very good, either up close or zoomed out. Even so, the 3DS manages to capture the spirit and overall feel of Xenoblades massive world. It has the same grand vistas, whether youre free-roaming the wide-open fields of Guar Plains or the deep jungle of Makna Forest, and the technical sacrifice means this version runs at the same speedy pace as the Wii game.', 'Control-wise, the New 3DS feels well suited to tackle Xenoblade. Bouncing between the C-stick and face buttons feels natural. The ZL and ZR buttons mean we get useful camera options to zoom in or out, and quick access to a fast-travel system. The only bummer is that it doesnt even try to use the 3DS touch screen. Thats an unfortunate omission, since the touch interface could have made navigating the menus a little easier.', 'Likewise, Despite the 3D in the title, Xenoblade Chronicles 3Ds unremarkable use of 3D doesnt make this version feel any better. Some cutscenes benefit from added depth, but theres no sense of dimension added to gameplay.', 'So outside of letting us experience this RPG on the go, Xenoblade Chronicles 3D adds very little. Collectible 3D models of the major characters and a music jukebox are neat, but having already played it on Wii, I certainly wouldnt buy it again just for that.']",IGN
29,Pillars of Eternity,26-Mar-15,Leif Johnson,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/26/pillars-of-eternity-review,"[""Just half an hour after Pillars of Eternity introduced a character whose wanderlust backstory was so eloquently told that I was sure shed be at my side for the rest of the campaign, I found her dead in a tragic mishap shed brought on herself. That was the moment when I knew I'd love this fantasy story and world: its so rich, it can afford to kill a promising adventurer just to set a mood. Its a bold move that couldve backfired, but developer Obsidians latest roleplaying game keeps the story momentum and awesome old-school tactical combat going for an impressive 70-hour running time."", ""Countless other characters crossed my path in the coming days, each with their own stories and personalities and each usually (but not always) voiced by a competent actor. Pillars of Eternity is something of a welcome novelty, in that such elaborate characterizations aren't just reserved for main characters; they extend to everyone, even random folks found on cobblestones of Defiance Bay or dozing drunkenly in the corners of weathered taverns. Reach out to their soul, and you're slapped with a personal story that spills out over fascinating walls of text but has nothing to do with the main story, and the quality of writing involved is such that these moments never entirely lose their appeal. It'd be a roleplayer's dream come true, if it weren't for the slight annoyance that some of the characters are voiced and others arent."", 'That ""reaching out to their soul"" bit isn\'t stylistic cheesiness. Pillars of Eternity casts you in the reluctant role of a Watcher  essentially someone who can ""read"" the souls of those around him or her (living or dead) for insights into their past lives or motives. The formula works well here because it helps Pillars avoid falling entirely into the cliche trap of the predictable Western fantasy RPG, in which a cocky young hero arises from humble origins and kills whatever dragons and bandits need killing.', ""Rest assured, there's still plenty of that. But the appeal here is that the Watcher's accidentally obtained ability (not unlike the Inquisitor in Dragon Age: Inquisition) allows him to see through the lies of the people around him, and that's a handy skill in a world where people openly hang soulless children from trees like Christmas ornaments. At times, that ability pushes what appears to be a humdrum side quest to greatness. Murder mysteries, for example, become much more interesting when the victim can show up to testify posthumously."", ""Lesser RPGs would stop at this and let such a quest devolve into a simple revenge and bribery scenario. Pillars's narrative greatness, however, is that it makes you question even this normally cut-and-dried situation by giving the killer a powerful and borderline justified motive. What then? Youre constantly presented with this kind of choice, and they seldom get easier."", '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', 'Advertisement', ""And yet Pillars's roleplaying strengths go deeper still. Much like many other contemporary story-driven RPGs, new conversation options unlock depending on whether you have, say, seven points in Lore or 14 in Might, but it radically turns the concept on its head by sometimes making these special options the wrong ones. A reputation system enlivens the options further, but even it sometimes tempts you into to the same traps. In some cases, you're better off sticking with the stock responses, meaning each must be read and considered carefully regardless of what kind of character youre playing."", ""The upshot of all this is that Pillars isn't a game for folks who don't like to read. A good chunk of its 70 hours is made up of absorbing at least a couple of lengthy novels worth of text. It makes up for the absence of flashy cutscenes with rich pen-and-ink illustrated storyboards covered with rich descriptions that convey nuances no animation could. Time and time again, Pillars shows that it's less interested in the content of the story (although that's wonderful) than it is in how the story is told. For the most part, the approach works."", 'All that focus on tough choices might lead you to wonder if Pillars is all talk, but in fact, it\'s intensely difficult and tactical. Combat, which draws heavily from the Baldurs Gate tradition, is the same kind of pausable real-time squad battle that BioWare made famous, but don\'t expect a Dragon Age-type experience where you can get away with effectively ignoring tactics. Neglect the pause button here, even for seconds, and you die - even on easy difficulty. I once let my party of six adventurers auto-attack (and there is that feature, at least) a group of ghouls in the woods on the easiest mode, and all except the tank died in the 10 seconds it took to glance at new emails on my phone. Pillars itself makes no secret of this brutality, as a descriptor for the Normal mode screams that it ""is NOT recommended for newcomers to real-time party-based RPGs."" Not hard enough? Try the Trial of Iron mode, which allows only one save file that automatically deletes if you die.', ""The good thing is that this challenge is rarely a problem because the UI is astonishingly intuitive, and Obsidian doesn't clutter the screen with elements that have nothing to do with the act of kicking butt. Assigning actions for each hero mercifully takes mere seconds, though very occasionally Id find that I had to re-issue orders I thought Id already given (either a bug or an easy mistake to make; Im still not certain). A comparatively open stat-allocation system ensures that there's almost always someone around who can pick locks or use scrolls while still carrying their weight in a fight, and a comparatively low level cap ensures the heroes seldom run the danger of out-leveling the content."", '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', 'Advertisement', 'I confess that the heavy micromanagement involved does grow a tad dull over time when spread across the maximum of six heroes  inevitable, perhaps, given the epic length. As a Ranger, for instance, I usually had to give separate orders to both my avatar and my pet in every situation. Worse, pathfinding glitches sometimes cause heroes to get caught on their allies when moving to their assigned spots.', ""But these are mild and infrequent annoyances in Pillars of Eternity's grand scheme. It's a world that's almost absurdly detailed, and it reveals careful thought in virtually every element and landscape placement. Consider the fallen beams of an otherwise-unimportant abandoned house, where we're told through a mouseover popup that a family of birds rests inside. Consider its simple but effective crafting system, which lets you concoct potions and scrolls, or influence day or night circles might have on conversation options. Extra touches abound, such as the more non-traditional of its 11 classes like ciphers and chanters who fight alongside stalwart but predictable warriors and priests, or the playable godlike race that walks the world with grotesque and sometimes vaguely phallic mutations of skin enveloping their faces. (This also means they can't wear helmets, poor things.)"", ""Sometimes, and only sometimes, I got the impression that Obsidian tried to cram a bit too much into this game, as in the case of a personal stronghold you expand chiefly by tossing money at it in the manner of Ezio Auditore's villa in Assassin's Creed II. The resulting bonuses and missions for inactive party members are nice (along with a sprawling dungeon waiting below), but the concept rarely feels like more than Kickstarter stretch-goal fluff."", 'If it isn\'t already clear, Pillars of Eternity was created out of a desire to resurrect the experiences of beloved, seminal RPGs like Baldur\'s Gate and Planescape: Torment, and for the most part it succeeds fantastically. Yes, you\'re even pestered to ""gather your party before venturing forth,"" and reaching a point where you can travel to a new zone often requires lengthy jogs across a map.', ""But if it clings to the stylings of the old Infinity Engine games in any one area too tightly, it's easily in the graphics. Having the benefit of hindsight, its surprising that Obsidian decided to build an isometric-perspective game without taking pains to correct the shortcomings of the setup, such as a rotating camera. As a result, on rare occasions shrubbery and walls obscure the action and make it difficult to issue commands."", 'To be sure, moments of stylistic beauty pop up often such as when you discover a skyscraper-sized jade statue under your keep, but the presentation itself always looks as though it were upsampled from some game created in the late \'90s. This is obviously intentional, but it\'s also unnecessary. Just last year, Divinity: Original Sin proved that you could recapture those wondrous early years of computer RPGs but coat them in landscapes and models that look every bit like they belong in the present. Other drawbacks spring from efforts to honor the backers of the hugely successful Kickstarter campaign. Much credit is due to those who helped Obsidian create such a wonderful game, but it\'s hard to take the outstanding storys heady proceedings seriously when you\'re constantly running across memorials to ""Boobplate"" and ""Bursk Awesomesauce."" Obsessive clicker that I am, I had to learn to ignore those.']",IGN
30,Axiom Verge,30-Mar-15,Marty Sliva,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/30/axiom-verge-review,"['Axiom Verge takes the adage imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and has it emblazoned across every moment of its 10-hour campaign. This 2D sidescroller pulls in most of the things that made Metroid such a classic experience: great weapons, interesting abilities, and a fantastic sense of progression. But where Nintendos classic presents a memorable setting with an evocative atmosphere, Axiom Verges world failed to leave a lasting impression on me.', '\n', 'The sense of character progression throughout Axiom Verge delivers a lot of satisfaction. Youre constantly stumbling upon new powers and abilities that allow you to go back and open up dead ends you passed long ago. Gaining the ability to phase through thin walls five hours in, and then using it to grab a power-up that you saw near the beginning of the game gives a nice feeling of accomplishment for those who pay careful attention to their surroundings at all times.', 'Likewise, seeing your hero grow from a relatively helpless guy stranded on a strange planet, to a demigod with an arsenal thatd make Master Chief jealous is a smoothly rewarding process. The dozen-or-so guns you get all feel very different, and have specific uses. The glitch gun is handy for transforming deadly enemies into peaceful platforms, while ice beams help to slow down particularly chaotic enemies. My favorite tool in Axiom Verges arsenal is a small spider drone which you can deploy and fully control to scout out sticky situations while your main character hangs back in safety.', 'Youll need to become familiar with all of your weapons and tools, because Axiom Verge features some awesome, challenging boss encounters. Learning their patterns and weaknesses, and ultimately slaying one of the massive beasts is a good old-fashioned rush. Controls are responsive, and the sensation of movement and combat feel great. Sure, there were a few that had me dying over and over again until I really memorized their patterns, but this was never too much of a burden thanks to Axiom Verges quick load times and ample checkpoints', 'While the combat feels great, Axiom Verges sense of exploration is a letdown. The map unfolds as a hodgepodge of identical squares that never really give you any indication of what youve stumbled across. While I appreciate a game that doesnt hold my hand, without a clear objective I found myself getting lost far too often, especially after taking a break and coming back to the game. And without a method of fast-travel, I spent far too much time wandering back and forth across vast stretches of the map in an attempt to figure out just what the hell I should be doing.', '\n', 'One place Axiom Verge fails to learn from the classics is in its world design. Where Super Metroid is littered with memorable scenery and zones that feel completely different, yet spatially connected to one another, Axiom Verges locales never really stuck with me. Nothing about the world really felt lived in, or had any memorable personality. Metroids world made sense -- whether it was a crashed ship to explore near the planets surface, or a zone near the planets core thats filled with molten lava. Axioms world just feels arbitrary.', 'That goes for the story, too. Where Metroid succeeds by delivering its plot purely through environmental storytelling and atmosphere, Axiom Verge often grinds the action to a halt and delivers an exposition dump onto you. The story certainly isnt bad, but I never felt attached to the characters or their problems, so pulling me out of the action ultimately turned into a chore.']",IGN
31,Neverwinter,8-Apr-15,Leif Johnson,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/08/neverwinter-xbox-one-review,"[""Console MMORPGs are apparently tricky affairs: regardless of how much effort developers put into them, something always seems too off  too complicated  and up until now the genre's thus largely remained a PC thing, especially in its purest sword-and-sorcery form. But Neverwinter for Xbox One gets closer to the ideal than any other EverQuest-inspired console MMORPG before it. Ive played and enjoyed Neverwinter before (when I reviewed it on PC two years ago) but this time its Dungeons & Dragons-themed online action hit almost all the right spots. As a free-to-play game, it blazes a trail for others to follow with generous content and great controls for its fast and fluid combat. I cant ignore the deafening silence of its community and some potentially deadly performance problems, but Neverwinter stands among the finest free-to-play MMORPGs on consoles to date."", ""My own enthusiasm surprises me because I've already done this twice before, when I leveled two characters to the level cap of 60 on PC. Not much has changed about the core leveling process in the intervening two years, apart from the introduction of two new classes and new races, but interestingly, elements that I formerly found disappointing on the PC version have assume an odd sort of appeal on the Xbox One."", ""Take the environments. Neverwinter isn't without its moments of beauty, and only a few hours in, I found myself looking forward to the moment when I could again ride up the haft of Lakkar's Axe, a skyscraper-sized greataxe that forms a bridge across a chasm on Mount Hotenow as though Marvel's Galactus had dropped it while trying to chop down Yggdrasil... or somesuch. The problem is that most of Neverwinter's heavily instanced zones are as linear as that haft, and many consist of little more than long paths as you bounce forward from quest to quest. Sometimes the path widens considerably, yes, but it's an experience that's not terribly unlike the opening 100 hours of Final Fantasy XIII, where the action unfolds across unrelenting, ill-disguised corridors before at last opening up to wider vistas. You eventually get that here at the level cap, but only in the form of slightly less linear instances."", ""But on the Xbox One, I find that's not so much a problem. The focus here is on combat in the style of God of War or Darksiders, and Neverwinter usually keeps me so focused on it that I rarely find cause to miss more open surroundings. I like to smash things, and it obliges with simple controls that make use the seven classes diverse abilities."", ""As a person who usually plays warriors in MMORPGs, I tend to judge them on how satisfying they make it to beat things down with a big hammer or blade, and regardless of Neverwinter's other issues, few MMOs beat it in this regard. I might hit the Y button to activate Restoring Strike, and boom, up goes my greatsword knocking back a dead enemy like Babe Ruth hitting a homer. I'll let my Daily powers build up, and bam, I shoot down to the Forgotten Realms with a slam that sends enemies reeling. Using these abilities with the Xbox One controller's rumble would make them even more exciting, which is why it's so bizarre to find it missing in action."", 'I was surprised by that because developer Cryptic gets so much about the gamepad right. The number of active abilities is small (compared to what you\'d find in, say, World of Warcraft or Lord of the Rings Online) but that means that they\'re easily mapped to the Xbox One gamepad, and to good effect. Pressing the left or right trigger activates the ""at-will"" powers, granting a hefty sense of swinging a mighty sword that I believe the keyboard often lacks. The rest of the active combat abilities fit comfortably on the X, Y, and B buttons, leaving room for interaction with objects on the A button. Non-combat stuff is neatly tucked away behind the Start menu and the bumper and D-pad buttons, allowing me to access my inventory almost as easily as I might with a keyboard hotkey. It\'s a model of intuitive design, and future console MMO developers would do well to study it.', ""Whats missing here is a reliably stable frame rate. Most low-level players will only see the framerates dip consistently in the combat-free streets of Neverwinter itself, where the crowds of players and NPCs sometimes overwhelm the hardware at moments when it can do the least harm. But in the higher and more detailed zones, like Icespire Peak, the environmental detail and weather effects sometimes slowed my Xbox Ones frame rate to a crawl. I can blame at least one death on Neverwinters frame rate causing a command to drink a health potion to go unheeded; when the world started moving again, my poor Great Weapon Fighter lay dead on the dungeon floor. To its credit, Neverwinter's combat is fun enough that I found myself looking forward to attempting the battle again, with a more careful eye on my health."", 'The other major letdown is in a lack of communication. Without an equivalent of the useful communication prompts in Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn, Neverwinter leaves everything to limited voice chat or text messages. The effect is that I leveled almost to the level cap without seeing a single player ever say anything in group, general, or looking for group chat. I once told a player I was ""headin\' out"" using only my gamepad, but the ordeal took me what felt like half a minute. Connecting a USB keyboard or using the SmartGlass app on my phone was easier, but no one seems to be taking advantage of that.', ""That's a shame, as Neverwinter actually does have some good group content in the form of skirmishes, dungeons, and PvP arenas, but it's hard to make friends and socialize when communication is so unwieldy. (On the other hand, the silence also keeps the trolls who spoil the fun in World of Warcraft quiet.) Voice chat works fine, though, and I had my best time with Neverwinter when I grouped with a pre-existing Xbox Live friend with whom I could chat about life as we quested. Neverwinter does allow you to use voice chat in almost every group scenario accessible through the queues, but based on my extensive experience, almost no one keeps it on."", ""I find myself wondering what this means for the future of Neverwinter's Xbox One community, particularly since this version lacks the player-made Foundry missions that emerged as the most memorable part of the PC version. Without that alternative to PvP and dungeons as a means of filling Neverwinter's inevitable XP gaps as you venture from one zone to the next, I did feel the grind a bit."", ""There is a built-in solution for that, in the form of purchasable experience booster packs from the cash shop. Neverwinter is, after all, a free-to-play MMORPG, but it sports one of the more generous models in that it lets you play through the entirety of the leveling content and beyond without spending a dime. Most everything available for sale is for convenience that I can generally deal without. The drawback, though, is that when you do want that convenience, Neverwinter saddles it with a literal high price. Almost everything in the shop is breathtakingly expensive  the smallest batch of coins costs $9.99. I was most interested in the Dragonborn Legend pack, which unlocks the Dragonborn race and includes a highly useful 30-slot bag among other things, but doing so would require that I fork out about $75. At that price, I'd be afraid of what people would say about me in-game. But then, nobody's talking anyway.""]",IGN

There arent any groundbreaking new features that distinguish it from last years also-impressive MLB 14: The Show, but the minor adjustments to its batting and modes are welcomed. Relying heavily on its nearly perfected formula of gorgeous scenery, strong gameplay mechanics, and rewarding game modes, its fundamentally strong, but theres not much by way of novelty to excite a returning fan like myself. \n', 'Focusing in on those improvements, the first is an incremental graphics upgrade. As great as last years MLB 14 looks on the PlayStation 4, MLB 15: The Show looks even better. Adding a real-time seasonal sun makes a big difference, thanks to striking shadows in each beautifully crafted ballpark that realistically shift throughout the course of a game. MLB 15 has also enhanced its exceptionally detailed player models by adding more skin tone variations that are much more true to life.', 'And the crowds feel alive. Fans hold up clever signs, dance when something great happens, and boo when something bad happens. Theres so much variety that I had a hard time spotting the same models or animations twice when the camera cut to the crowd: families, friends, couples and season-ticket holders are all distinct. Its astounding. As long as you dont look too hard at whats behind the bleachers, the environments are completely believable, and can be remarkably immersive.', 'On the field, the biggest addition this year is directional hitting. Being accustomed to lining up my bat with the ball, this more intuitive approach to hitting actually took me a while to understand. Now, aiming where I want my ball to go feels more logical. Meanwhile, weve still got the solid pitching options available, including my personal favorite: pulse pitching. Its a happy balance thats nuanced and challenging, but not overwhelmingly complex. On defense, players respond realistically wherever the ball lands, and controlling their fielding is smooth and easy.', 'The entire list of game modes from last year are back and slightly better than ever. First of all, Im happy to report that the online modes The Show are vastly improved compared to last year, when the lag made MLB 14 unplayable at times. I havent experienced a single lag-related hiccup so far this year, but I have seen the occasional glitch.  I have to point out, though, that Sonys announcement that the online modes for MLB 14 will be turned off in June [update: in response to feedback, Sony has extended the life of MLB 14 indefinitely] has shaken confidence that MLB 15s online modes will be around for long. \n', 'For single-player modes, the new year-to-year save feature allows you to continue your progress from MLB 14: The Show, which is great, because I wasnt ready to say goodbye to my team. (I spent way more time than Im willing to publicly admit making franchises full of created players with the names and likeness of my friends.) \n', 'The flagship Road to The Show mode has gone mostly unchanged. As before, you start the career of a MLB hopeful, level him up by performing well on the field, and work your way up to the big leagues. Its quick, addicting, and scratched my RPG itch... again. The only notable change to this mode is the addition of licensed equipment  for example, you can earn universal card drops that reward you with equipment like Rawlings gloves, Louisville Slugger bats, and Nike shoes. Their presence adds to the authenticity of the branding-heavy real-world MLB broadcasts, and also gives you a little stat boost.', 'Meanwhile, Franchise mode adds GM contracts and ownership expectations, which can lead to job offers from other clubs if you do well... or can get you fired if you dont. That fear of failure made me plan more carefully and think about every decision I made, as opposed to just trying everything to see what would work. Also, the new Inside the Show radio show does an impressive job with contextualized updates from your team and from around your own personal league. \n', 'The virtual card-collecting fantasy baseball mode, Diamond Dynasty, has been simplified for MLB 15. Its now much more manageable with no contracts to worry about, and is fun even without buying into its microtransactions. You dont even have to play Diamond Dynasty to collect cards anymore, which allowed me to play other modes without feeling like I was missing out on opportunities to progress my team.', 'The best addition to Diamond Dynasty, however, has to be the custom-made utility player that can play every position, including pitcher. When you first create him, hes a very average player, but feeding him unwanted cards from your stash improves his skills. Finding the balance between using my best cards to field a competitive team, saving Giants cards to eventually unlock Will Clark, or feeding them to my created player is rewarding, and will keep me coming back for more.']",IGN

It constantly oscillates between thrilling action scenes, hilarious back-and-forth banter, and some poignant character moments. Each member of your core group is fleshed out, new characters (like Handsome Jack himself) are introduced and provide some fantastic new dynamics, and the episode ends on one of the best cliffhangers in recent Telltale memory.', 'The 90 minutes of Atlas Mugged take the same Cowboy Bebop-esque caper vibe of the original episode and run with it. From the opening scene, in which youre forced to go to grotesque lengths to get past a retinal scanner, characters are constantly thrown into insane situations where they just cant seem to catch a break. I loved getting so close to my goal multiple times over the course of the episode, only to have it snatched away from me at the last second. I couldnt predict where the next scene would lead me, but by the end of Atlas Mugged, I had full faith that it was somewhere entertaining.', '\n', 'The episode is rife with memorable interactions and hilarious moments, a lot of which center around the holographic ghost of Handsome Jack. The way you choose to have Rhys deal with him, whether it be through raw fear or wide-eyed admiration, leads to some of the funniest banter Telltales ever delivered. But the jokes arent just there to make you laugh  with each hilarious line, layers of Rhys personality are peeled back, the bond between Rhys and Vaughn transforms, and the links between Telltales series and the three main Borderlands games are strengthened.', 'While Rhys side of the tale delivers a series of comedic blows, Fionas half is a quieter, more emotional story. How you choose to have Fiona and Sasha deal with the fallout of Episode 1s conclusion really lets you mold what kind of characters they are. Being empowered to dictate whether Fiona takes a higher road, or remains hellbent on revenge led to some really tough decisions: Do you fuel Sashas anger and feelings of betrayal, or try to calm her down at the risk of causing a rift between the two of you?', 'Its a testament to Telltales storytelling that these two tonally different sides of the adventure are woven together without ever coming across as jarring. Seeing the same event from both sides, ping-ponging across Pandora to see how ones decision impacts the other, and constantly trying to figure out how theyre going to get from their present situations to the future scenes that pepper the story give Atlas Mugged a great sense of forward momentum.', '\n', 'Episode 2 also succeeds at adding even more interesting characters to the already fantastic cast. Particularly interesting is Scooter, a mechanic who just might be the dumbest person on Pandora, but also the most loveable and surprisingly loyal.', 'Aside from the fantastic writing, Telltales hit a creative stride with humor that draws from the gameplay mechanics as well as fourth-wall-breaking moments. Just when I grew tired of pointing my targeting reticle to catch something falling through the air, Tales from the Borderlands delivered a joke that astutely turned this mundanity into a punchline. Likewise, having characters pose and stare at the screen when theyre introduced, completely confusing those around them as to what theyre looking at, just adds to the dense layers of jokes throughout Atlas Mugged.', 'While all of this is great, Im still not entirely sold on Tales inventory and currency systems. Throughout Episode 2, I packed my pockets with random grenades, shields, and doo-dads that I found throughout Pandora, but still havent really found a use for any of them. Maybe the payoff is somewhere down the road, but were almost halfway through the season and the whole system still feels half-baked. Same goes for the money Ive gathered  aside from a single aesthetic purchase in each of the two episodes, Im not sure why Im even bothering with rummaging through the world search of cash.']",IGN

Its a fun way to spend an evening, although I noted its an experience largely built by repurposing wholesale slabs of Forza Horizon 2 content rather than doing much new or interesting with the movie license.', 'Unlike last years Storm Island expansion, FH2 Presents Fast & Furious takes place on part of FH2s main map but is an entirely standalone game (although this means a confusingly hefty download, even if you already have FH2 installed on your Xbox One). Its basically a chunky, themed demo for FH2.', 'It limits us to the French portion of the pre-existing map but it does cover quite a few event types in its brief two- to three-hour duration. There are tight street races around Nice, high-speed blasts through the countryside, a small clutch of stunt challenges, and a pair of the series trademark Top Gear-inspired Showcase Events (which, in this case, pit your car against a helicopter and a plane).', 'As youd expect, the racing and driving here is just as blissfully brilliant as it is in FH2. Several driving aids can be toggled to hone the experience to your liking, and theres a huge amount of joy to be gleaned from tearing up France in the Fast & Furious series iconic black Charger, watching the butterfly valves on the blower work overtime as you poise nearly 4,000 pounds of Detroit metal in the perfect drift.', 'The one notable new mechanic is a nitrous boost mechanic  an obvious inclusion for a Fast & Furious tie-in  and its been implemented well.

The overall effect on your speed doesnt cross into Hollywood absurdity, its more subtle and realistic, but I think the latter is more fitting for Forza. Its only available during events, however; you cant activate nitrous in free-roam. Its an odd design choice and one thats slightly disappointing.', 'But again, owners of Forza Horizon 2 will find little more than that by way of new content. The intro of FH2 Presents Fast & Furious, which drops you into a yellow Lamborghini Huracan, is largely a rehash of FH2s introduction. The two Showcase Events are actually just repeats of existing Showcase Events in FH2 (the chopper race in the Xbox 360 version and the cargo plane face-off from the Xbox One version). The cars, weather, and time of day are different here, but the routes are identical, which feels a bit cheap.', '\n', 'With so much recycled, its somewhat strange that several regular Forza features have been plucked out. Theres no economy here; you simply earn the available cars by winning them over the course of a short series of 11 events (the action is narrated by Fast & Furious series actor Chris Ludacris Bridges, who provides the games credible but admittedly loose association with the films). There are also no visual customisation features either, nor is there any upgrading or tuning. Each car comes pre-tuned to the top of its class and you cant apply custom designs.', 'Perhaps most disappointing, the new cars built for FH2 Presents Fast & Furious arent able to make the trip back across to FH2 (or, least, they arent for now) if you own both. Its a small shame because, once Id clocked the available events and reaped most of the Forza Rewards points on offer via the Forza Hub (where its listed as a separate game), Ive felt little reason to go back to this version.']",IGN
35,Game of Thrones: Episode 3 -- The Sword in the Darkness,24-Mar-15,Dan Stapleton,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/24/game-of-thrones-episode-3-the-sword-in-the-darkness-review,"[""A lot is packed into this eventful two-hour episode of Telltales Game of Thrones. It begins with an action-heavy cameo appearance by one of Daenerys' dragons, then sets Gared on a dangerous path, and sees Mira struggle with multiple layers of intrigue. The cycle of abuse by the Whitehills occupying Ironrath is starting to sound like a broken record, though."", ""Across the Narrow Sea, Asher Forresters scenes force you to decide where your version of this characters priorities lie. Telltales done a good job establishing his relationship with Beskha, making it hard to forsake her even for the good of the family, represented by Asher's wooden uncle Malcolm."", 'At the Wall, Gareds again pushed to pick sides between his two companions in the Night\'s Watch. Here, as a result of Telltale\'s signature ""helix"" storytelling structure, in which story paths diverge only to be reunited a short time later, the previous episode\'s decisions were noticeably robbed of consequence  I felt I was too easily able to talk my way back into the good graces of whichever character Id wronged. However, the Wall scenes are redeemed by a few good twists in the story.', ""Specifically, the mystery of the North Grove starts to take shape, and with it, Gared finally gains a purpose in this story beyond tempting us to blab every secret he learns to anyone who'll listen (don't worry - he gets another chance here). He also gets an opportunity for righteous revenge  rare for a Game of Thrones character  but I like how its hinted that itll have major consequences. We all know what happens when someone dies north of the Wall..."", 'Back at Ironrath, the arrival of Lord Whitehills even more antagonistic son Griff seems redundant. The Forresters have already been tormented by Ramsay Snow/Bolton, Lord Whitehill himself, and the nameless Whitehill soldiers, and the interaction between Griff and Rodrik is a retread of the ring-kissing scene in Episode 2. Sacrificing Forrester pride for the greater good is no easier to do the second time, though. The redeeming piece of the Ironrath story here is a revelation from a new source, which ups the potential for intrigue  but actually investigating it has to wait until next time.', ""In Kings Landing, Miras story gets more tense and interesting. Shes now involved in a coverup of her own, and we have to avoid tensions between Tyrion Lannister and Margaery Tyrell that werent present in the show or books, so I didn't see them coming. Even though they might not be positive outcomes, its empowering to see that the decisions weve made about whether to get involved with Tyrion have big ramifications for our relationship with Margaery, especially during the events of her wedding to Joffery. Miras mission to get help for the Forresters back home turns into a struggle just to minimize the damage.""]",IGN
36,Life is Strange -- Episode 2: Out of Time,24-Mar-15,Mitch Dyer,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/24/life-is-strange-episode-2-review,"[""The ending of Life is Strange: Episode 2 - Out of Time took the wind out of me. Its an episode wounded by character inconsistencies, frequently terrible dialogue, and tedious puzzles, but the finale brings the series strongest story moments together in a heartbreaking way -- and you can't do anything to undo it. Main character Max Caulfields choices from both Episodes 1 and 2 come to a head and really have substantial meaning to the people around her. In turn, suddenly Life is Strange has meaning to me."", 'I criticized Life is Strange: Episode 1 - Chrysalis, for failing to create convincing, compelling characters, and developer Dontnod has almost entirely rectified this issue in Out of Time. The writing and character performances remain problematic, but the humanity hidden beneath the awkward delivery of out-of-place lines bursts free in Episode 2. For the first time, Im interested in character arcs and mysteries that arent directly about Max Caulfield. Characters that didnt work before now have more meaningful time in the spotlight, and they have a huge effect on Maxs future. All of this feeds back into a likable, relatable protagonist I continue to enjoy playing.', 'The figure at the front of this is Kate Marsh, a devout Catholic with no memory of certain humiliating events that have gone viral. In Episode 2, which is ultimately her story, Kates position as the schools least-liked student grows into something more dramatic. I was receptive to that. I did everything in my power to support Kate because Life is Strange creates brutal situations that made me want to. Hints of drugs, mental illness, and potential sexual abuse make for a nasty combo. Still, I would understand why a player may not pick up on these subtle, quiet elements of Kates story, and prioritize other characters and choices instead. After all, Max has other problems (and closer friends) to worry about, too.', 'Chloe, Maxs old friend who became a rebellious troublemaker, brings us closer to the mystery of Rachel Amber, a fellow student whos been missing for a concerning amount of time. Exploring the junkyard where Rachel and Chloe spent time together showed a sad, almost jealous side of Max I didnt know existed. We also get a look at what Rachel meant to Chloe, who felt abandoned when she and Max lost touch in the years before the series started. Life is Strange succeeds most with meaningful moments like this. Episode 1 dabbled in creating an effective relationship, and tapping into the volatility of teenage emotion, but Episode 2 makes it count.', 'These great scenes happen despite (and partially because of) weak puzzle-solving sections. Life is Strange: Episode 2 has a couple scenarios that rely on more conventional video game design than its story-centric sequences. By the end, though, I really appreciated what these limp scenarios led to. A tedious sequence meant to expose Chloe to Maxs time-rewinding powers has unexpected meaning later on, as does the time-consuming fetch-quest that follows. It just isnt clear until youre blindsided by its significance.', ""Everything in Out of Time just feels important in a way Chrysalis didnt. I would rewind time to undo choices, regret it, rewind again, regret it, and eventually settle on something I wasnt sure about. When circumstances prevented rewinding at one point, the series' heaviest scene so far carried that much more weight. By Episode 3, itll be too late to change what I did in Episode 2, and I cant wait to see what mess I made for myself during its stressful finale. The emotional gravity of those moments also leads into a great cliffhanger, and Im genuinely upset I cant see the rest of the story through right now. If the rest of the series capitalizes on the strengths of Episode 2, and abandons the failures of the premiere, it could really be something special after all.""]",IGN
37,Battlefield Hardline,16-Mar-15,Brian Albert,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/16/battlefield-hardline-review,"['In Battlefield Hardlines single-player campaign, I had as many chances to arrest the bad guys as shoot them  and I actually wanted to take them alive. That was only the first of many surprises.', '\n', 'Unlike most video game bad guys, these enemies actually respect the badge of a police officer, and that gives you options. If you can get the jump on a group of three or fewer, you can order them to freeze by pulling out your badge and shouting. From there, you can arrest them... or gun them down. If you can stay out of sight, cuffing them is usually the superior option because it earns you more points, which unlocks more weapons and gadgets.', 'If youre really good, these levels are designed intelligently enough to allow you to sneak around arresting bad guys one by one until, finally, when you look around, all you see are handcuffed, knocked-out criminals. Its not the kind of satisfaction I expected from a Battlefield game, but it requires patience and skill, and I was constantly delighted to see my enemies numbers dwindle while my magazines stayed full.', 'Again, you can also run around shooting everyone, and that works too. Part of Battlefields legacy includes realistic weapons that feel and sound great, and thats no different here. When I forgot to disable an alarm and 10 enemies surrounded me, my rifle was a lot more effective than handcuffs.', 'Second, Hardlines seven-hour campaign is  and I never thought Id say this  just as fun to play in stealth as it is running in guns blazing. Before entering combat, you can scan an area and tag enemies, explosives, or alarm systems so theyll appear on your radar. Its rewarding to formulate a grand plan from afar before jumping into the action.', 'With proper preparation, enemies cones of vision appear directly on your minimap, Metal Gear Solid-style. If you can avoid detection, its entirely possible to make it through most areas without firing a single lethal round.', 'My biggest gameplay gripe is that the unlock system doesnt appropriately award your playstyle. The best way to boost your level, which dictates the weapons and gadgets at your disposal, is to play stealthily. Strangely, mastering stealth mostly unlocks tons of big, noisy guns that made me want to shoot the place up. Likewise, if you want to shoot stuff all the time, youre not going to get your hands on new guns as quickly as the stealth player who doesnt need them. And there are very few unlocks that make stealth more interesting.', 'The third surprise was that I cared about the characters. My disapproving partner, my stern boss, and the motley crew of ex-cops, coked-up criminals, and more than a few traitors  all of them felt like people, thanks to good writing supported by strong voice and animation work. Make no mistake, Hardlines drug-peddling plot is one youve almost certainly seen before, but it does such a fine job of making its characters funny, sympathetic, and believable that I wanted to keep playing to see what would happen to them.', 'Hardline has a few issues with some of its enemies though  specifically, a group of one-dimensional Tea Party caricatures in possession of a safe-cracking robot. Theyre presented as over-the-top evil racists to give you an unambiguous sense of morality when gunning them down. They told my character You look Mexican, so Ill assume youre a burglar. An hour later I was facing off against their leader, who hooted and hollered as we engaged in tank-to-tank combat. Its fun, but hard to take as seriously as the subject matter suggests it should be.', 'By comparison, the storys main villain is devious and cunning. Hes not the most interesting or memorable bad guy, but hes the kind of narcissist who keeps the secret switch to his penthouse vault inside a carved bust of himself. I can appreciate that kind of vanity, and going after him was less of a black-and-white decision thanks to a few shades of gray.', 'The last surprise Hardlines campaign had for me was moments of comedy. Several laugh-out-loud moments make some self-aware fun out of its own crazy situations and mechanics. In one especially clever moment, after being flung into a room packed with enemies, the prompt to order enemies to put their hands up briefly flashes on the screen. In another moment, nearly $10 million worth of cocaine is ruined in an unfortunate forklift accident. Its not forced, and those nods to Battlefield fans makes the campaign that much more enjoyable.', 'Battlefield has a history of looking and sounding excellent, and Hardline continues the tradition (though resolution is a disappointing 720p on Xbox One and 900p on PlayStation 4). Through gunfights, car crashes, and explosions, it all runs at a smooth 60 frames per second that stayed rock solid on PS4 and Xbox One.', '', '\n', 'The tone of Hardlines multiplayer is downright bizarre. If a smack-talking gamer kid grew up to be a cop or a criminal, this game would represent them. Through in-game emotes, the characters trash talk each other, recite internet memes, and blare loud, obnoxious music as they ride to war. I didnt expect to hear my allies give their own takes on Oprahs famous You get a car line, nor did I expect to hear Woop! Woop! Thats the sound of da police, moments before a cruiser ran me over. At least in the short term, the emergent comedy is unexpected gold  and sometimes you wont see it until it literally flattens you.', 'New gadgets, like the grappling hook and zip line, add further options by letting you reach higher vantage points and move around quickly in a way we havent seen in a Battlefield game in 10 years. Plus, your team can use them too, so they can use their gadget slots on something else. The issue is that these mobility items dont feel useful unless you grab both  a way to get up, and a way to get down  which limits your capabilities for what you can do when youre up there. I often had to sacrifice body armor, breaching chargers, or some other useful gadget.', 'The most astonishing thing about Hardlines multiplayer is how successful it is in trying to please everyone. If you want more capital-B Battlefield, like the iconic Conquest mode and its large-scale vehicular combat, 66 players, and tons of weapons and gadgets to unlock, youll find it here. Even Commander mode is back, now dubbed as Hacker mode, and it lets you hijack cameras, release tear gas, and disrupt enemies across the map. Its a great way to be proactive without firing a weapon, if thats not your thing. If youre feeling franchise fatigue, its new modes and gadgets alleviate that.', 'Hotwire is Hardlines fresh marquee mode, and it injects some much-needed mayhem into Battlefields 13-year-old multiplayer formula. Think of it as a special version of the traditional capture-and-hold Conquest mode, but, instead of holding structures, you have to keep control of moving vehicles; if you dont drive them fast enough, you dont get points. (Its the sort of like the concept of the movie Speed, but gamified.) When the most contested combat areas are mobile, the flow of the fight itself becomes dynamic, and its difficult to skirt around the fight. A sniper might feel safe, for example, crouched on a crane near the edge of the map. Second later two vehicles might roar by, packed with thugs firing their assault rifles. Those cars might then attract the attention of a heavily armed helicopter, belching out bullets from both its sides.', 'Suddenly, your safety zone isnt so cozy.', 'War can descend on you at any moment. Youre rarely comfortable, and youre never safe. That makes Hotwire a great mode that forces you to move around and adapt to new situations quickly. I had some trouble adjusting because of my old habits of patrolling one area (its not camping!), but I had a good time learning to adapt to the new reality. After a few hours of getting my butt handed to me, I was back in business.', 'Some of Hardlines other modes take everything Battlefield is known for and do the opposite: 5v5, round-based games that can be over in seconds. In one mode, the police must rescue a bound hostage and escort him to safety. In another, a VIP must be escorted from one side of the map to the other. In both modes, you only have one life. The action is quick and brutal, and the big, unfolding combat narrative found in typical Battlefield games is absent. Its not missed, though, because, that story is replaced with awesome kills, tense standoffs, and plenty of amazing comebacks.', 'The payload of nine maps isnt a ton, but because theyre so varied and change depending on the game mode, so I never felt like I was stuck in the same place for too long. Settings range from small, tight, urban areas to sprawling swamps, where an enemy could be prone behind any patch of grass or below any crippled dock.', '\n', 'Across both current-gen versions of Hardline, all of the multiplayer matches I played on launch day connected in literally two to six seconds. This includes both quick match games and games I connected to through the server browser. The connection stayed consistent too, and I was able to see them through until I won or lost.']",IGN
38,Resident Evil Revelations 2 -- Episode 3,10-Mar-15,Lucy O'Brien,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/10/resident-evil-revelations-2-episode-3-review,"['I dont know why that makes sense  but somehow it does, says Moira Burton in Resident Evil Revelations 2: Episode 3: Judgement, as she completes a puzzle which - in typical Resident Evil fashion - is devious, but defies any kind of real-world logic.', 'Its a nice summary of this episode, as Judgement continues the twists and turns at a healthy clip. The original Revelations spent a great deal of time over-explaining the semantics of its complicated relationships; Revelations 2 is thus far content to let us sit back and enjoy the mystery, as Moira and Claire get closer to the truth, and Barry and Natalia get closer to Moira. (Whether or not it can tie up these plot threads together in a satisfying way, however, remains to be seen.)', 'Admirably, theres a real attempt to flesh out the characters here, too. While Barry Burtons voice actor is better suited to gruff quips than spilling his guts, he has a nice little moment with Natalia that gives him a little humanity and grows him beyond his  master of unlocking legacy. Claire also gets to show an emotional side, and although both stutter through awkwardly written dialogue, I found their earnestness endearing.', ""But it's the clever riddles and traps in Judgement's (unfortunately still bland) environments I enjoyed the most here, which made me wonder why they were absent in previous episodes. Keeping with Resident Evil tradition, many of these are outright silly (like the one that causes Moira to get a little meta), but some incorporate genuinely clever level design."", 'During one section, for instance, Barry and Natalia must move a box from one end of a level to the next. Throughout this task, you must use both characters abilities to keep enemies at bay, while placing and standing on the box to reach high spots and open gates. Its a wonderful segment, and I wish more of Revelations 2s unexciting corridor environments could have been spiced up in a similar fashion.', 'Such inconsistency in design seems to be the common theme in Revelations 2 on the whole. Of the two boss battles in Judgement, one is a tense and thrilling affair in which Claire must face an extremely agile creature who can latch onto her like a lizard-tongue from long distances, while the other is dull and cripplingly unimaginative: Barry fights a creature with a glowing red belly that shambles at you slowly until youve plugged enough bullets into him. To me, it felt like the designers ran out of ideas, put this cheap guy in as a placeholder, and never took him out.']",IGN
39,The Evil Within: The Assignment,11-Mar-15,Lucy O'Brien,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/11/the-evil-within-the-assignment-review,"['Its remarkable how much of a departure The Evil Withins first story DLC, The Assignment, is from the main game. Where the original is all about bullets and confrontation - albeit with a blundering lug of a character - The Assignment is more about staying in the shadows, avoiding enemies, and keeping a cool head in the face of terrifying monsters. Its the sleek black cat to The Evil Withins big shaggy dog, and a great addition to Game Director Shinji Mikami and Tango Gameworks new survival horror universe.', 'The Assignments three-and-a-half-hour story runs concurrently with the main games, filling us in on what Juli Kidman  a detective, or perhaps an agent for a sinister agency?  was up to during her mysterious absences. Throughout, youll see original protagonist Sebastian and his partner Joseph in familiar situations, which adds to a sense of a much bigger and wonderfully ominous picture.', 'This story is still as high-concept as it ever was, but it helps that Kidman is a more knowledgeable character than Sebastian from the get-go, and more likable, too. Voiced with confidence by Dexters Jennifer Carpenter, shes a more reactive, and therefore believably realistic, character. Carpenter even sells Kidmans somewhat cliched backstory, told through audio tapes, with a performance that avoids theatrics.', 'Physically, Kidman is less powerful than Sebastian. Roughly 95% of the time she is unarmed, and there is no upgrade system in The Assignment. Instead, her skillset focuses on stealth. Kidman can lure enemies by calling out while taking cover against walls or other objects, throw bottles to distract them, move without running out of puff, and auto-heal rather than use syringes.', 'These abilities work well  for the most part. The Evil Withins old-school controls dont always lend themselves to fluid movements, and occasionally I got stuck to a surface or unintentionally popped out of crouch when trying to turn a corner. The stealth attack, introduced later into the episode, also feels a bit haphazardly implemented  that became an issue for me when a boss fight relied on it.', 'But considering how thrilling it was to play a survival horror game with nothing at my disposal but a torch, I didnt mind much. I spent a lot of the time running blindly with my heart thumping, hoping a distracted enemy wasnt now in pursuit, or yelling in triumph after locking one in a room. Without a weapon, the tension builds quickly.', ""Adrenaline is encouraged by The Assignment's sinister environments. Tango has once again done some wonderful things with lighting, with many of its twisted corporate interiors drenched in sickly, flickering fluorescence, and others in dirty, wet shadow. I frequently found myself crouched behind flimsy cover in the dark, terrified to turn on my torch, as footsteps ever so slowly made their way towards me."", 'Although their A.I. isnt as sophisticated as, say, Alien: Isolations, enemies in The Assignment will pursue and kill you quickly, so youll want to avoid confrontation at all cost. While I would have liked a little more variation in enemy design, and perhaps more threatening enemies overall (l died considerably less here than in the main game) there is a particularly vicious recurring enemy in The Assignment that I loved. To describe it at all would spoil, but its up there with The Evil Withins keepers and Resident Evil 4s regenerators; in other words, a Mikami Special.']",IGN
40,Dragon Ball Xenoverse,4-Mar-15,Jake Magee,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/04/dragon-ball-xenoverse-review,"['Dragon Ball XenoVerse takes most of what I like about the anime and role-playing games and combines them into a single, great-looking package. Its strange, then, that it mostly neglects the single most important thing that makes Dragon Ball Z great: the fighting. I had fun building a hero all my own, but her journey through the DBZ lore is deflated by one-sided fights and combat that boils down to what feels like glorified button-mashing. I was ultimately left wanting more than the shallow, frustrating, and repetitive combat.', 'As much as I wanted to love the combat, I couldnt. Every different combination of face buttons and resulting varying animations led to the same outcome: punching your opponent and making them fly far away from you. The strategy behind these fights never gets very deep, and I settled into a repetitive but effective pattern of punching and kicking a villain across the map, then charging up to get enough Ki to use an ultimate attack. (Annoyingly, those miss half the timeeven when an enemy stands directly in front of you as your worthless beams pass through their body). Defense is in the same boat: when an enemy starts to get a combo going, dodging isnt worth the stamina cost and blocking requires almost psychic-like reflexes to pull off, meaning I never really used them. Instead, I helplessly took the assaults, then returned the favor until someones health invariably ran out.', 'With combat a lackluster affair, the most enticing part of XenoVerse is the ability to create your own fighter. From Saiyans to Namekians, theres a wide range of races to choose from, each with unique stats and fighting styles. Everything from their gender, size, shape, and voice is customizable. I settled on Muu, a mute female Majin known for her high defensive capabilities, fast speed, and slow stamina recovery. The story she starred in is straightforward but at least somewhat original; Im happy it was more than a shameless rehash of the anime (though it felt like one at first). It was awkward to hear characters like Trunks and Goku refer to Muu as the gender-neutral they or, bafflingly, even as he during the in-game scenes, and the cheesy dialogue and terrible voice acting certainly didnt help matters  but Ill take that over playing as the series overused protagonists any day.', 'With character creation comes leveling up and stat allotment  an odd choice for a fighting game all about aliens with world-destroying energy beam powers and masculinity complexes to feature such heavy role-playing influence, but its cool to see a character I invested time in grow and ultimately become more powerful. The pacing of character progression in XenoVerse is great, as new powers and skills are unlocked gradually  and there are a lot of them. Crafting a skill set of hard-to-acquire special moves that worked with my fighter was half the fun.', '\n', 'Despite enjoying the RPG elements of tailoring Muus stats, equipment, and moves, taking a health potion after having the tar beaten out of me just doesnt feel right for the Dragon Ball Z universe. XenoVerse would have been far better off eliminating items altogether and just making combat a more balanced experience, because many fights are completely unfair. One early story mission put me up against 20 enemies, demanding that I keep two NPCs alive the whole time. This wouldnt have been so bad if my allies werent completely worthless, but as it is, it became a race to see if I could destroy all 20 opponents on my own before they took out the teammates I was forced to babysit. Another mission late in the game spiked in difficulty so severely that I was forced to grind  a boring and arduous process  for several hours before I leveled my character enough that I even had a chance to proceed.', 'In fact, after a while most missions became a frustrating tease. Just after expending most of my health potions to down a difficult enemy, a cutscene would play and the fight would resume with the majority of my opponents health restored. Id lose, have to back out to the hub world, trek to the item shop to buy more potions, and repeat the process.', 'Fortunately, distractions from the 30-hour single-player campaign arent hard to come by in XenoVerse. I found more joy teaming up with other players to take on unique missions called Parallel Quests that rewarded me with money, experience, and new moves and powers. Those rewards often make them more valuable than story missions. Stages feel cramped and static, but Parallel Quests often feature multiple levels to give them some variety. Unfortunately, the competitive multiplayer battles are the shallowest of XenoVerses modes. Quick and dirty, theyre over in minutes, meaning I spent more time getting the tedious matchmaking to find a game than I did actually playing.']",IGN
41,Cities: Skylines,10-Mar-15,Dan Stapleton,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/10/cities-skylines-review,"['Much as I prefer to let each game stand on its own, certain games demand comparisons. In the case of Cities: Skylines, developer Colossal Order has overtly modeled its game after SimCity  not just the fundamental concept and methods of building and maintaining a simulated city from the ground up, but much of the look and feel as well. And on almost every count, Skylines compares very favorably to the former standard-bearer of the city-building genre. It is, in fact, the best of its kind to come along in a full decade  a powerful, flexible, beautiful, and all-around impressive simulation that lets you build sprawling, single-player metropolises to your hearts content. Building has to be its own reward, though, because the lack of random events or disasters leaves the job of running these towns feeling sleepy and meditative.', '\n', 'Playing as part mayor, part god-king with the power to arbitrarily bulldoze your simulated citizens dreams and create schools with a click, building a city from scratch is mostly conventional: lay down roads with the easy-to-use tools, designate zones for residential, commercial, or industrial buildings, provide utility services, reap the tax boon, then repeat the cycle with new stuff thats been unlocked by your growing population hitting new milestones. Skylines finds a mostly happy medium between the complexity of SimCity 4 and the relative simplicity of SimCity 2013 by automatically attaching zoneable areas to roads as theyre laid, but still holding onto obligatory busywork like laying water pipes. Those basics are all tried and true - you couldnt have a city-builder without them - so its mandatory that they be done well. Cities: Skylines does that.', 'The first way this sim knocks it out of the park is in its scale. Each game begins as deceptively small, constricting you to a four-square-kilometer area (the same size as a SimCity map, entirely by coincidence Im sure), but quickly allows you to buy access to an adjacent plot of land of equivalent size. Then it does this seven more times, for a total possible area of 36 square kilometers. Suffice it to say, theres plenty of room. And while you cant directly edit terrain while you play, theres an included map editor where you can create any land mass you choose before you jump in - or download one from the prominently integrated Steam Workshop mod support.', 'With such large cities, its fantastic that Skylines allows you to define and regulate areas individually. Simply paint a chunk of your city with the District tool, and you can not only name it so you can spot it easily on the map, but give it unique policies that regulate everything from mandating smoke detectors to reduce fire hazards (at a cost) to legalizing recreational drug use for lower crime rates, or banning highrise buildings to create defined downtown and suburban areas. In industrial zones, you can specialize the businesses to exploit a maps natural resources in the area to mine ore, drill for oil, farm on fertile land, or harvest trees for forestry. You can even create tax incentives for a specific type of zone within each district.', 'Lets zoom in for a moment: we can see individual humans walking through the streets, going to work or school, engaging in leisure activities, or returning home by the thousands. They drive cars, take trains, and even walk dogs. (You can individually name them, but I suggest naming them Waldo, because there are so many that if you find that specific one again you I say you basically win the game.) This is where you realize the time scale becomes absurd. On the slowest speed a day lasts 10 seconds  three and a half on the fastest  which means the journey to work could last a week. But the lack of a day and night cycle means time doesnt seem too unnatural, but rather an abstraction to serve the speed at which things are built and tax money flows in.', 'Making a major citys traffic flow smoothly is a puzzle I havent come close to fully cracking yet, but I do feel good when I easily create overpasses and freeway onramps to experiment with routes that direct the flow and ease the gridlock... at least partially. By default, most advanced road types are locked out at the start, which makes planning a city around trains or subways nearly impossible (unless you plan on supervillain-level demolition later on), but theres a sandbox mode thatll allow you to build whatever you want, whenever you can afford it. (Theres also an unlimited money mode.)', 'Mass transit is a tricky beast. Its not enough to lay down bus stops and train stations; you have to plot out routes individually, or no one will go anywhere. Its easy to get lost in that, especially as routes start overlapping and its frustrating to get your bus stop placed on the correct side of each narrow road. But there are a lot of options, and the endorphin rush from making a red traffic data overlay turn green makes it all worth it.', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'Up close, buildings are colorful and detailed, right down to small animations like rooftop fans spinning. A slider in the options menu gives us control over the amount of depth-of-field blur applied to distant buildings when zoomed in, which mimics SimCitys attractive diorama effect. Skylines doesnt match the graphical quality of SimCity, though, and given the great numbers we see them in they dont quite have the variety needed to prevent most neighborhoods from looking pretty much the same.', 'What Skylines isnt good at is telling you what youve done wrong, and what problem you need to solve right now. For instance, when I hit 50,000 citizens, the gauge at the bottom of the screen that indicates what new zone type my city wanted in order to expand bottomed out. It didnt want anything at all. Hundreds of buildings were abandoned, without explanation. How can I address the issues that are hamstringing my city when I dont know what they are, and the in-game advisors provide no insight? I built new residential, commercial, and industrial zones and waited; eventually, without my taking any deliberate action or receiving any explanation, the zones filled and growth resumed upward of 100,000. I dont understand why.', 'In that light, its fortunate that its fairly difficult to send your city into a death spiral without actively trying to, or making worse financial decisions than Greece. It has to be as deliberate as placing a sewage drain pipe directly upstream from your water pump  basically piping raw sewage into your citizens tap water  or borrowing more money than you can ever hope to repay. Even crime is disappointingly easy to keep in check with a single police station serving a town of 40,000.', 'Its limited to man-made crisis-management because there are no earthquakes, tornadoes, destructive floods, nuclear meltdowns, zombie outbreaks, UFO or monster attacks, or anything fun like that. The only thing close to a disaster is a fire, and those dont spread from one building to another, even if left completely unchecked. I dont mean to fault Skylines for not cloning every single feature of SimCity, but I do consider disaster management to be a major part of running a big city, and without it Skylines lacks a certain sense of excitement thats been a staple of the city-building genre since the beginning.', 'Likewise, its really hard to become unpopular without trying. Even during periods of what the in-game fake Twitter and an abundance of abandoned buildings would have me believe to be times of great distress, Ive never seen the general happiness icon in the menu bar dip below what Id describe as a psychotic grin. Those tweets (or Chirps, as theyre called) initially seem helpful, pointing to power outages and the like, but are quickly drowned out by repetitive and useless in-jokes and chatter. Theres no way to turn it off, unfortunately.', 'I suppose I could probably drive public opinion down if I took the bait and really tried. Skylines grants access to unique buildings like stadiums and observatories behind achievements, which range from encouraging, such as educating 50 percent of your population, to the demoralizing, such as allowing garbage to pile up, unemployment to skyrocket over 50 percent, average health to plummet, have 1,000 simultaneously abandoned buildings, or other generally unpleasant things. I havent brought myself to wreak that kind of destruction yet, since I do have a sort of attachment to my cities, but I have unlocked enough of them that I was able to reach the somewhat underwhelming final goal of building a Wonder - in my case a Space Elevator, which served as yet another tourist attraction. Regardless, a lack of public approval doesnt seem to be something you need to fear in Skylines, which is slightly demotivating.']",IGN
42,Ori and The Blind Forest,9-Mar-15,Mikel Reparaz,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/09/ori-and-the-blind-forest-review,"[""If you were to judge Ori and the Blind Forest solely by appearances  its prominent images of Ori being cuddled by his rotund adoptive mother Naru, for instance  you might assume you were in for a short, pleasantly tepid art-house platformer, the kind where gameplay exists mainly to support lavish graphics and the emotional pull of the story. Instead, Ori is a demanding, cleverly intricate Metroidvania-style adventure in which a quick trigger finger and perfect timing matter almost as much as exploring its secret-filled environments. That its also stunningly pretty, includes a sweeping orchestral score, and tugs at the heartstrings certainly doesn't hurt, either."", ""Of course, the forest cant be saved as easily as simply returning your floating companion to his tree. Three stolen, life-sustaining elements need to be restored to their respective homes first, and finding them means trekking across a huge 2D landscape of interconnected areas, uncovering hidden power-ups, and earning new abilities along the way. Like any good Metroidvania, these abilities  which let Ori pull off moves like double-jumping, wall-climbing, stomping through weak platforms, and grabbing enemies or projectiles to slingshot himself in different directions  open up new areas for exploration while adding to Ori's combat repertoire. The progression from powerless sprite-child to nimble engine of destruction is elegantly smooth, with so many opportunities to use each skill that, by the time you've discovered the next one, using the previous ability will have become second nature."", ""That's important, because Ori's exploration sometimes feels like training for the real challenges: Its dungeons, a trio of self-contained levels that push you to make heavy use of whatever abilities you've found beforehand, and which sometimes feature unique challenges, like carrying a gravity-bending orb that lets Ori safely walk upside-down across lethally hot surfaces. While taxing, those feel like cakewalks next to each dungeon's climax: an intense, no-room-for-error escape sequence that makes Metroid's time-bomb finales seem tame by comparison. Here, the difficulty spikes wildly as you're forced to execute a precise series of moves while death closes in on your heels. With no checkpoints, mastery through repetition becomes crucial, and that mastery gets a little easier if you can rely on muscle memory to, say, catapult yourself over an incoming fireball before scampering up a wall to relative safety."", 'The escape sequences walk a fine line between being rewardingly difficult and infuriating, partly because they disable your most important ability: the creation of ""Soul Links,"" which let you save almost anywhere. There\'s very little auto-saving in Ori, and death reverts you to your last save, so it\'s up to you to remember to save often. If you do, Soul Links are a huge asset, letting you instantly respawn just before (or after) trouble spots and saving you the hassle of repeating tough areas. Forget to use them, however, and it might take you a while to find your way back to where you were.', ""Not that that's necessarily a chore; Ori's level design is striking, with lots of distinct, memorable areas that are fun to get around in even after you've visited them a few times. And while there's no fast-travel in Ori's sprawling world (which is mildly annoying), it compensates by making backtracking actually enjoyable. As you work your way back to a previously unreachable spot, your new powers are almost guaranteed to help you discover a few hidden power-ups and secret areas along the way, making the trip feel worthwhile. If you're a completist, however, you'll want to fill out the map before tackling Ori's final stage; completing the 10-hour story locks your save file, forcing you to start a new game (unless you had the foresight to make a pre-endgame copy of your save) if you want to discover things you missed."", ""As fun as exploration is, combat is a little more uneven. Hammering enemies with fireballs is satisfying at first, but feels weak and ineffectual later on, so it's often better to use Ori's other moves, like catapulting enemy projectiles back at their owners, bashing monsters into thorny walls, or simply stomping them when they get underfoot. Having a diverse range of attacks is great, but none of them feel quite as precise as simply shooting, and they can frequently backfire (by sending Ori shooting into thorns, for example) while you're learning to use them effectively."", ""Also, Ori always feels fragile, even when his life meter is filled out, and his tiny onscreen presence (coupled with the abundance of glowing projectiles flying both ways) can sometimes make it hard to tell exactly where you are, who's shooting, and whether that shimmering blob sailing toward you is acidic goop or a clutch of harmless XP orbs. It doesn't ruin the experience, but it can lead to a few awkward deaths as you frantically leap into danger to grab a power-up.""]",IGN
43,Helldivers,13-Mar-15,Vince Ingenito,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/13/helldivers-review,"['Helldivers is the rare game that knows exactly what it wants to do, and does it with complete confidence and authority. So much more than just another twin-stick shooter, it presents us with incredibly varied mission sandboxes and tactical options, then respects our intelligence enough to let us figure it all out on our own or with three friends. The result is some of the most white-knuckle co-op action Ive ever experienced.', 'From the opening cinematic, Helldivers wears its Starship Troopers influences on its sleeve. The tongue-in-cheek, over-the-top way in which it sets up the ongoing war between the aliens and our homeworld, Super Earth, is a clear nod to director Paul Verhoevens film, and it lends the action a delicious sense of both humor and danger. Its mostly superficial in that the themes of radical Nationalism are never really explored, but the jingoistic one-liners your space marine spouts out are chuckle-worthy all the same, effectively drawing me into Helldivers persistent online war despite knowing my people probably started it for all the wrong reasons.', ""This questionable galactic war is fought on three fronts against the tech-heavy Illuminate, the gun-toting Cyborgs, and the Tyranid-esque bugs known simply as...bugs. Each faction brings a diverse set of units to bear, requiring you to either adapt your tactics, or die a horrible death. Cyborgs tote a lot of small caliber firearms, making heavy body armor a great choice to shrug off volleys that might have otherwise put you on the ground. Don't forget to bring something to punch through armor too, or you'll spend the better part of your mission running from mixed groups of tanks and hulking mechanized super-soldiers. On the other end of the spectrum, failing to pack some extra ammo for your shotgun against the bugs is usually a fatal mistake, since they love to get up close and personal."", ""Every online match of Helldivers feeds into this three-pronged war, with each fronts greatest contributors being cleverly immortalized with an ever-present leaderboard. As you and your fellow heroes retake planets by waging successful missions, the war will eventually spill over to the alien homeworld, or to your own if not enough people are fighting the good fight. Either situation leads to a timed special event where all players are called on to make one final push, or a desperate last stand. It's a smart system that gives each mission a greater sense of purpose, not to mention an urgency to log on every day to do your part."", 'The real magic though, happens when you start unlocking more of Helldivers large arsenal of perks, weapons, upgrades, and equipment calldowns called stratagems. After over 25 hours, I still havent gotten everything, and from disposable anti-tank weapons, to gun-covered troop-carriers, every piece of gear feels meaningful, since each ends up being particularly useful for certain objectives or against particular foes. Capture or defend objectives call for sentry turrets, where snow-covered maps might tempt you to bring an exo-suit or a jump-pack to make traversal easier. You can only bring so much though, and adapting your loadout based on what your objectives are and what your teammates are bringing is where Helldivers exhibits much of its depth.', 'No matter what you bring to the fight though, Helldivers meaty sound effects convey the action convincingly, despite its so-so visuals. Whether youre squeezing the last few rounds out of a heavy machine gun, or obliterating a screen full of enemies with a thundering artillery strike, everything sounds powerful and threatening.', 'Many of these delightful bits of kit are designed to facilitate cooperative play. The recoilless rifle, for instance, comes with a separate supply pack with extra ammo. You could carry it yourself, but the reload time between shots will make it pretty impractical to use. Have a buddy carry the supply pack though, and they can walk up to you and toss in another shell in the blink of an eye. Touches like this make a full party of four feel like a cohesive fighting unit where every member is more powerful than they would be alone. Helldivers drop-in co-op makes forming a party easy from the couch, online, or a mix of both, which is fortunate, because while going solo can be rewarding in its own right, you can only get so far on your own.', ""The fact that virtually everything is deadly, be it friend or foe, makes every mission tense. Drop pods bringing a fresh supply of ammo might unceremoniously turn a teammate to goo, or a poorly placed airstrike might do more harm than good. There's just so much nitty gritty to get into, from going prone to let teammates safely fire past you, to using 90-degree angle shots to maximize armor penetration against enemy vehicles, and the cost of learning is almost always paid in blood - be it yours or a teammate's. But when you and your team fire on all cylinders to turn back the intense waves of enemies coming your way long enough to dramatically hop in a dropship and make a narrow escape, the sense of accomplishment is positively euphoric.""]",IGN
44,Far Cry 4: Valley of the Yetis,9-Mar-15,Jon Ryan,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/09/far-cry-4-valley-of-the-yetis-dlc-review,"['The first time I encountered the titular beast of Far Cry 4s Valley of the Yetis DLC, I was unarmed, alone and trapped in a cave with the 10-foot-tall monster. As it tracked my scent and inched closer, I felt my heart rate rise with every step I took towards my escape  and when Id finally made it to safety I breathed deep a sigh of relief. Just like Far Cry 4 before it, this expansion did an excellent job of immersing me in its new setting, and manages to be a raucous good time in the process. However, while Valley of the Yetis presents some interesting changes and its gameplay fundamentals are still fun, when the short campaign is over theres not much left to do.', 'While basics of Far Crys first-person exploration remain unchanged, there are a few mainstays that have been done away with here. The most notable omission in this new location is the need to liberate any outposts. Instead, it places you (as Ajay Gale) in a single relay station that you must defend from nightly attacks. Forgoing the organic day-night cycle, assaults are triggered by advancing time. When the sun goes down, waves of soldiers - and eventually yetis - begin their onslaught, and the balance of fortification and frantic action feels just right. The ability to add defenses like machine gun nests or minefields  available either by completing side missions or by purchasing them for in-game cash  gave it an enjoyable tower-defense sensibility that meshes well with the horde-repelling action.', 'This new defensive emphasis makes sense, given the relatively smaller scale of Valley of the Yetis. The snow-covered valley map is beautifully designed, and creates the impression that its much larger than it is. Sparse branches and brown leaves cover trees along the edges of snowy fields and iced-over rivers, while packs of wolves hunt high in the foothills and caves of the icy Himalayas. This is one of the best environments seen in a Far Cry game yet, to the point where Im somewhat upset there werent more areas like this in Far Cry 4.', 'Of course, wolves are hardly the most dangerous creature in this icy playground. As the title implies, mythical beasts roam these hills - and they are both fun and frightening opponents in combat. Since theyre essentially 10-foot gorillas, the yetis are incredibly strong  usually one to two hits and youre dead  but theyre also alarmingly fast. I recall the first time I stumbled across the elusive beast in the open world; I had (foolishly) attempted to bring it down with a bow, and it gave chase. Assuming Id be safe, I hopped onto my snowmobile and sped off... only to look behind me and see that the monster was gaining on me. Thankfully, it was distracted by a passing jeep full of human enemies and decided to focus on de-socketing some of their limbs instead of mine.', '\n', ""It was organic moments like these that made me forgive the campaign's lackluster story. The core conceit of Expedition Finds Monsters, Goes Insane is good, but that was never the focus of the plot. Instead, were forced to listen to Ajay argue with the antagonist via radio, and any backstory I gleaned was from picking up various notes and journals around the world  many of which I missed or didnt feel compelled to collect at all. It wasnt until the final missions that I found myself even somewhat invested in my fight against the cult-like Disciples of Yalung, and even then that interest dissipated when I blasted my way through to the less-than-satisfying ending. Its a shame, too, because while the campaign missions themselves are fun and the nightly defenses and upgrade quests are a cool addition, theres not much else to do in the Valley aside from collect weapons and animal skins."", 'You might say to yourself, Why should I bother picking up weapons? Ive already unlocked all the signatures! While in the main game youd be correct, in Valley Ajay is reset to zero  youll need to re-acquire all of his weapons, re-craft all of his bags, and re-earn all of his skills and abilities. Thankfully, this is made easier by the fact that XP is far easier to earn, and unlocking items and weapons are now done by finding chests and caches on the map instead of liberating bell towers. I understand that forcing us to re-spec our skills and loadouts may add a sense of progression and a couple of hours of playtime, but it begs the question: If youre going to make it so easy to re-earn everything Id previously unlocked, why bother making me repeat myself at all?']",IGN
45,Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number,10-Mar-15,Chloi Rad,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/10/hotline-miami-2-wrong-number-review,"['Sprawling in both story and level design, Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number is a more fleshed out, ambitious follow-up to its 2012 predecessor. There are a few truly frustrating moments, but that sense of flow is still here; its a relentless, rhythmic, and brutal game of killing fast, and often dying even faster.', 'Hotline Miami 2s style is a smooth continuation of the first game. It moves the setting ahead into the grungy 90s, but also occasionally whips us back to the mid-80s in a feverish rollercoaster ride that further unfolds the twisted story. This is a deep dive into an engaging alternate history full of masked fanatics, mobsters, drugs, war, and a few haunting figures from the past. The soundtrack, dripping with nervous synth and a pulsing bass, is even better than the last one; a moodier and more expansive set of tracks merges appropriately with the symphony of door-busting, skull-crunching, and gun firing youll create yourself. Like the last game, the music is the fuel that drove me forward into each new challenge  and in Hotline Miami 2, there are plenty.', 'Hotline Miami 2 carries on the same top-down twitch-shooter gameplay and ultra-violent retro art style of the original, shifted only slightly to make things feel fresh. Whats changed most is the scale of the levels. Where Hotline Miami 1 had you shooting, stabbing, and bludgeoning enemies in a series of small rooms and hallways, Hotline Miami 2 isnt afraid to drop you into vast, open areas, where danger lurks outside the boundaries of your screen. This is an interesting change of pace that demands a new, more cautious approach.', 'These large-levels can end up feeling a little too imposing for their own good. There were several points when clearing even half an area became a painstaking task, and in a game where all of that progress can be destroyed in an instant by an off-screen enemy with a shotgun, its really tough.', 'What saves it from being overly frustrating are a few new ways of dealing with distant threats: most notably an improved lock-on system. Pushing the lock-on button instantly targets the enemy closest to your cursor; if the enemy is outside your range of vision, a red arrow appears to point you to him until you either undo lock-on or track him down.  Its a slightly unfair advantage, but serves to balance out the leap in difficulty that comes with Hotline Miami 2s more sizable maps.', 'The story has also grown into a layered multi-character saga that spans several years and involves a serial killer, a Russian gang war, and even an actual war. Its less of an ambiguous mystery, but just as bizarre and fun to piece together. The more plot-driven approach means we dont get as much freedom to choose how we tackle each level, because most are tied to a specific character. The upside is that it also allows room for Hotline Miami 2 to present new situations, interesting characters, and unpredictable events that break away from the typical expectations of a sequel.', 'Hotline Miami has always been known for its mindless killing, but in Hotline Miami 2, the dozen playable characters are defined by their personal motivations. You can play as a soldier who kills because hes in a warzone, which is a very different reason from the copycat killers who recreate the crimes of the original Hotline Miami character. This saves it from falling into gross repetition or suffering from style over substance. It also means that Hotline Miami 2 can explore new scenarios, thanks to character-specific goals.', 'One character, in a shocking twist for Hotline Miami, can actually get through a level without killing anybody (unless you manage to send him into a murderous rage). Knocking someone down and picking up their guns results in an animation of you rendering the weapons non-lethal. Playing through these levels is very close to the lethal ones, mechanically speaking, but its still an interesting example of a characters personality changing things up.', 'While many levels are bound to a particular character, there are a few that do offer some choice, either variations of a mask or other accessories that grant different abilities. The carnage wreaked by the chainsaw- and gun-wielding brother-sister duo in Swan masks was especially fun to play, but I also enjoyed the sequences featuring characters who dont even wear masks at all. In terms of story, a restraint like this makes sense and is a great way to get us closer to whats happening and why, but in terms of gameplay, it can feel limiting. Its a trade-off; a negotiation between some of Hotline Miami 2s more arcade-like aspects and a more fully fleshed-out story that allows for the exploration of several different tones and moods.', 'Fortunately, an unlockable Hard Mode prevents some loss in replay value. This new difficulty mode mirrors level layouts, adds more enemies, and removes the ability to lock on  all excellent tweaks if you love a challenge. An early version of the Hotline Miami map editor is also included, which is already easy to use and is a great way for the community to expand the life of Hotline Miami 2.']",IGN

It hit the Vita with a fresh perspective, demonstrating just how great technical street skating could be in 2D. OlliOlli 2 blows that first effort out of the water on every level.', 'This is developer Roll7s Tony Hawks Pro Skater 2. Like that landmark game, OlliOlli 2 introduces the manual, bringing a whole new dimension to the gameplay. It works in much the same way, letting you land in a manual out of any trick and thus keep your combo going, opening up the possibility of beating each level in a single monster trick.', '', 'Bluntslides are cool, but OlliOlli 2 introduces new tricks like darkslides.', 'Each of OlliOlli 2s levels are short gauntlets, jam-packed with stair sets, rails, ramps, deadly obstacles and  in the case of the Titan Sky levels  towering robots, hovercars, and toxic ooze. The skating is pure and skill-based. Forget steering: this is a left-to-right stream of skating consciousness, where youre flowing gracefully from one mini set piece to the next, attempting to commune with the clever level design and trick mechanics.', 'Flip tricks and grinds are the main tools of your trade. The former are triggered with a flick or swirl of the left analogue stick (potentially with a shoulder button held down if its particularly complex). So far, so similar. The innovation is that you need to catch the trick to land it, and the later you catch it, the better the rating you get  from sloppy to perfect. Tap X (or X and left or right for a manual) just before you hit the ground and youll be awarded a perfect landing.', 'Grinds are a little looser to execute, only requiring holding in one of four directions (again, potentially with one or more shoulder buttons as modifiers), but the same timing applies: move and hold the analogue stick at the last second and youll get a perfect rating, this time accompanied by green sparks and a speed boost.', 'Perfect ratings mean a faster-climbing multiplier for trick combos, but they also factor into the level design in a pretty major way. Once youre a chunk of the way through the career mode, youll come across grind sequences that arent possible to beat unless you nail the timing, or score goals that require switching grinds on the fly  which is only possible with a perfectly timed initial grind. Youll also be required to use perfectly timed tricks off ramps to boost to the next section... or wind up broken and battered on the spikes below.', '', 'The aforementioned spikes below.', 'Thankfully, OlliOlli 2 doesnt demand that of you initially. In fact, it gives you plenty of time to get a feel for the systems and get your eye in. By the time it starts throwing steeper challenges at you, you should be ready for them.', 'Each of the 25 amateur levels has five challenges to beat (beyond getting to the end), and theyre a great mix, addressing every aspect of the gameplay. From combo and high-score tests through to nailing specific tricks or collecting hard-to-reach items, the challenges are a great teaching tool in their own right. It wasnt long until I was nailing perfect single-combo runs and feeling like a badass.', 'Theres always a steeper challenge, of course. Once you master all five challenges in an amateur level, a corresponding pro level opens up, with its own set of five. And if you can beat all 250 amateur and pro challenges, youll unlock another set of even harder levels. (Full disclosure  Im nowhere even near this.)', 'OlliOlli 2 has a learning curve that seemingly goes forever, but its pacing is expertly judged. Even challenges that I attempted upwards of 40 or 50 times didnt leave me (too) frustrated. The mechanics are robust enough, the controls responsive enough, and the level designs finely honed enough that I was content to simply keep at it. The restarts are instantaneous, by the way. That helps a lot.', 'Outside of the career modes 50 levels, there are another 50 spots to post a high score on  and see how you fare against your friends and the world. Theres even an Ultimate Spots Score, tallying up your scores across all 50 spots. Its a shame theres no way to watch a replay of the top runs on the leaderboard in-game to see how the hell the score was earned, but Im sure therell be plenty of videos floating around on YouTube before long.', 'Its also a shame that the Combo Rush mode wasnt ready for launch. This splitscreen multiplayer mode will definitely help round out OlliOlli 2s ways to play when its eventually patched in.', '', 'The Olliwood premise is put to good effect.', 'No matter, because theres a lot of gameplay here already, and its tied together by an absolutely inspired makeover. The original games functional pixel art has been replaced by a highly stylised, flat-shaded look thats slick and contemporary, while also echoing points of inspiration like Another World and Prince of Persia. Each of the five locations is wonderfully distinct, taking you from the film back-lots of Olliwood through to the film sets themselves, covering Aztec ruins, the wild west, a creepy amusement park, and a futuristic cityscape. It can take a few minutes to adjust to the palettes and iconography of each new setting, but overall the visual design is a triumph. Its far smoother in motion than the original too, and the controls are every bit as responsive as youd expect for a timing-based game.', 'Another bonus is that OlliOlli 2 is cross-buy between PS4 and Vita, and integrates cross-save to allow you to move your game between devices. It plays really well on Vita, with the brief levels and instant restarts making it a great short-burst game while out and about. Its definitely best on PS4, however. I found it easier to time my manuals with the Dual Shock 4s far more robust analogue stick, and the art direction and silky frame rate are at their most impressive on a big screen.']",IGN

Not this one. Despite the challenging puzzles of Mario vs Donkey Kong: Tipping Stars later levels, we never really see anything new or different, and its big idea to encourage and reward community-designed levels is a bust, thwarted by cynical players.', 'Tipping Stars plays out much like its likeable Mario vs Donkey Kong predecessors: guide Lemming-like toy versions of Mario characters through small hazardous areas. You have no direct control over their movements, but you can control their environments with your stylus to force them onto a safe path using girders, conveyor belts, pipes, springs and more. Its helpful that you can effectively pause the action while stretching out girders and conveyor paths to get their placement right, though I find it makes things a bit too easy to plan ahead in some levels. However, even with that advantage, getting gold-medal scores by collecting coins along the way requires expert timing.', '\n', 'Some of the later levels had me frantically placing and picking up girders, blocks, and conveyor belts just moments before my mini-Mario wouldve careened over the edge of a spike-filled pit  and I loved every moment of it. What I didnt love was getting through the over 40 introductory levels that felt more like a series of simple mechanical tasks to be completed than puzzles I needed to think about to get past. Even when the challenge ramped up, though, I was never given the same sense of awe that tells me a puzzle game is something novel and special.', 'As someone whos played previous Mario vs. Donkey Kong games, the lack of new ideas is disappointing. The highlight of Tipping Stars meager innovations is a cursed mini-Mario that wanders the map as a moving hazard until you whack him with a hammer, but even he never significantly changed the way a level played. Likewise, neither the 3DS nor Wii U versions take advantage of their touchscreens beyond simple stylus tapping and dragging.', 'At least theres a lot of content, and more on the way. Each of the six main worlds teaches you a new mechanic or block to work with, and by the eighth and final stage of that world youll have to prove youve been paying attention. Add that to the two additional worlds unlocked later, and the three bonus worlds unlocked by earning gold trophies, and youll have a lot to learn and master.', '\n', 'If that wasnt enough already, the level editor workshop makes its return, along with the new and improved community hub where you can upload and share levels across both the 3DS and Wii U. This is where Tipping Stars gets its name: you can both collect stars from completing a community-made stage, and give them to a stages creator as a tip for a job well done. These stars can be used to unlock more tools and cosmetic changes in the workshop. Using that to encourage people to build and post interesting levels to keep the puzzle love happening long into the future is a brilliant model... in theory.', 'In practice, theres one tiny hiccup: as of writing, a quick glance at the top 50 popular stages (its hard to view anything other than that) shows that most are quick and easy levels designed to get you stars fast. And of course, who wouldnt give a Yeah rating to a stage that essentially gives you something for nothing, and helps unlock those bonuses right away? Theyre basically cheats, and its a shame when you think about the many smart amateur level designers out there who spend their time crafting challenging and creative levels for us to play, only for nobody to actually see it because its buried under countless crappy free-star levels.', 'Thankfully, there is still one more place to look for challenge: The Nintendo Official Levels. Starting with the release of Tipping Stars, Nintendo has promised that two new levels will be uploaded by developers every week, for 50(!) weeks straight.', ""One other notable thing about Tipping Stars is that its the first Nintendo game to offer cross-buy, meaning a purchase for either the 3DS or Wii U will net you a code for the other platform. This is great in theory, until you find that it was meant to be played on a small touchscreen with a stylus, so the Wii U version offers virtually no benefit over the portability of the 3DS  the screens a bit larger, but you cant take it with you. Thats not to say the Wii U version is entirely inferior, as families or friends can still gather around the TV to give tips, but Tipping Stars short but challenging level structure feels much more at home when you're on the go, waiting in line, or looking to kill some time.""]",IGN

On top of that, brutally challenging new difficulty modes like hardcore or Gods Must Die will give any expert demon slayer a deadly run for their money.', 'Toss in the rebalanced enemies with different attack patterns and tells, a new 60-floor arena called Bloody Palace made exclusively for Virgil, and youve got plenty of reasons to keep fighting the demonic hordes of DmC again and again.']",IGN
49,White Night,9-Mar-15,Daniel Krupa,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/09/white-night-review,"['Darkness, and the fear of what might be lurking in the shadows, can be terrifying. Or, it can also be deeply annoying  as exemplified by White Night, the adventure-game equivalent of banging your shins on a coffee table. The relationship between light and shade is brought wonderfully to life using a distinctive monochromatic graphical style, which lays the ground for an atmospheric and eerie adventure. Yet the same style undermines its exploration and puzzle-solving elements every step of the way.', '\n', 'The tone established by a near-exclusive use of black and white is definitely the best aspect of the experience. With a slow jazz piano playing softly in the background and darkness enveloping the lead character, I felt like I was stepping foot in a classic noir thriller from the 30s. I was drawn in by its heavy use of tropes, deliberately overwritten dialogue, crammed with outlandish similes, and its grizzled voice over  White Night wears its pulp influences proudly. But its also a haunted house mystery and a Hitchcock-inspired thriller. In short, there are a lot of influences swirling around, and while some overlap quite nicely  the damsel in distress reimagined as a restless spirit  overall I found it a bit of a muddled mashup.', 'Where it definitely succeeds, however, is in creating atmosphere and a sense of place. Vesper Mansion is a gloomy, fascinating environment I initially loved exploring. Emptying the world of colour creates a stark and stylish take on reality, where darkness really can consume you and light really does feel like a precious and powerful resource.  Matches are needed to help you navigate the shadows, but they burn out quickly and provide no real protection from the evil ghosts that freely roam the gloomy corridors; electric light is the only way to permanently exorcise any nearby spirits. It reminded me of the original Resident Evil, where every room of Spencer Mansion had something cool or creepy to disclose, with the most disturbing secrets being buried deepest.', 'Likewise, the spooks themselves are excellent; theyre fuzzy, flickering creatures that look tormented in death. You can just about glimpse them through the darkness, contorted in a variety of sinister poses, from facing a wall or swinging from the rafters. If a ghost spots you, it issues a piercing cry and chases you  and that, right there, is the moment when White Night stops being any fun at all. It is possible to evade them, but more often than not, being spotted means youre heading back to the last checkpoint, which is usually a frustrating distance back. Theres literally nothing you can do, unless you happen to be next to an electric light at the time. Any tension I felt pretty soon gave way to frustration, then boredom.', '', ""Who wouldn't want to go inside?"", 'You can only save when you find an armchair in which to have a bit sit-down (similar to the original Resident Evils typewriter save system) which would be fine if Vesper Mansion werent so sparsely furnished with them. I found myself returning constantly to the nearest armchair  even if nearest meant a bit of a trek  to save my progress every time I completed a stage in a puzzle I was in the process of solving, because it got to the point where I couldnt face redoing it all again should I accidentally run into the ghost on the final step.', 'That sounds whiney, I know, like Im not up for a challenge. But the frustration I felt was exacerbated by another factor, one that unfortunately I have to traced back to White Nights greatest strength: that art style. At the core, this is a puzzle game, in which you have to find items and solve problems. For example, you move an object and a ray of light falls to reveal a key. Its neat, smart, and works well... but none of this is particularly aided by the near-absence of light or the insta-death enemies, and its actively hindered by the use of fixed camera angles. Seriously, for one reason or another, you cant see what youre doing most of the time.', '', 'Mother!', 'At the beginning, I thought these stylish shots were fantastic. Theres one shot early on which looks down on you from a birds-eye perspective as you walk up the steps of the mansion; its straight out of Hitchcocks Psycho. But when I was trying to find a light switch, and the camera angle obscured its location until I stepped into a very small sweet spot, I could have quite happily done without the artsy presentation. Sometimes I even resorted to the boring-but-reliable tactic of sweeping the perimeter of a room to see if an interaction icon would appear. (If youre ever stuck, it usually means a light needs to be switch on somewhere.) Welcome back to the tedious old days of pixel-hunting adventure.']",IGN

The fact that Im making those calls while playing as a completely eclectic assortment of Steampunk-infused historical figures and famous fictional characters, from Abe Lincoln to The Wizard of Ozs Cowardly Lion, as they battle aliens makes this a memorable challenge that you can take seriously, even if its setting is anything but serious.', 'STEAM looks like a third-person shooter, but its just cleverly concealing turn-based action with an action-point system that lets you freely roam the map in what appears to be real time. Its a clever mashup, and one that empowers you to make grueling decisions. I find the close camera angle effectively builds suspense as you deploy, survey the terrain, and decide how to approach the enemy on the battlefield. Its an entertaining loop that lets you try lots of  different approaches before locking in a choice by taking an action or getting too cocky and triggering an enemys overwatch.', 'With 12 gradually unlocked characters to choose from, each mission unfolds differently depending on how you load out your four-person squad. Every soldier has a unique primary weapon and passive ability that makes them distinct, and grouping them with complimentary teammates and subweapons is the key to success. The tools at your disposal increase as you unlock more characters and useful upgrades over time, like special backpacks that can increase their action points and how many regenerate on each turn.', 'The arsenal is wacky, but also extremely deep. Take young Tom Sawyers Punch Gun, which can smack a smaller enemy a few feet back. With the right ally, you can set up an elaborate deathtrap of mines and other hazards, and use Tom to shove an unsuspecting foe into its killzone. Or you can come up with even trickier solutions, like using H.P, Lovecrafts character Randolph Carter to toss out Unspeakable Lure. This piece of meaty bait can lure enemies to their doom. STEAM comes up with dozens of smart, creative ways to control a snarling crowd of foes.', 'Staying alive long enough to do all of that can be tricky, though; because theres no overhead view, you dont always know the enemys position, even when theyre lurking around the corner. Avoiding ambushes means you have to think carefully about how you move forward and which foes you attack, because if youre caught off guard, the enemy arsenal is just as nasty as your own. The AI is dauntingly effective at using overwatch to stun-combo your squad for additional damage. I just wish there was a way to speed up the alien turns, because they can sometimes go on for a long time with not much happening on screen.', ""The Lovecraftian aliens themselves arent as visually impressive as STEAM soldiers, but theyre distinct enough to tell their various types apart at a glance, and they're no slouches in combat. Take the Nettler  this tiny, simple-looking flying alien doesnt inflict huge amounts of damage, but its hard to hit, and it can instantly stun most characters. The blind Rippers, on the other hand, use sound to locate soldiers. They roll and tear through cover to go after anything they detect, and if youre smart you can fool them into flattening their own troops. These diverse enemies can put the kibosh on your best plans, so its best to identify them and the best tools you have to take them down quickly."", 'Two-player multiplayer matches work in much the same way as single-player combat, except with a quick 60-second turn timer. After the luxury of taking unlimited stretches of time to carefully plan movements, this faster pace makes these skirmishes feel like speed chess. The manic thinking required to come up with strategies is daunting at first, but both Deathmatch and Medal Match (a race to collect dropped items from dead enemies) are a fun twist for anyone whos conquered the 15- to 20-hour campaign.', 'Of the three multiplayer match types, the only one worth skipping is A.B.E. Battle, a mode where two robots who bear a striking resemblance to the United States 16th President beat up on each other. It tries to turn STEAMs real-time elements into an action game, but the controls dont translate well. Too often, it played out like a hamstrung version of Rockem Sockem Robots. ']",IGN

While still defiantly an action game, surviving in Revelations 2 is now a much tougher prospect. In other words; now were in business.', ""In Episode 2: Contemplation, Claire Redfield and Moira Burton continue to be taunted by a cryptic puppet-master in an intriguing story thats getting more Saw-like by the minute. This baddie isnt scary, per se - like a number of Resident Evil villainous overlords, she's all pantomime - but Im enjoying the mystery of her, and the way in which shes particularly adept at ushering her unwitting minions toward dastardly cliffhangers. Breaking Revelations 2 into episodes is a bit of a strange choice, but theres something to be said for a bit of rest and contemplation between these breathless encounters."", 'As our villain becomes more wicked, so do the enemies that populate Revelations 2. One of my complaints in the first episode was the mundanity of its monsters, and while they havent grown more interesting, theyve certainly grown more resilient (and in greater numbers).', 'Coupled with a genuine scarcity of supplies, there are are a handful of of boss fights - and a ridiculously tense chase sequence - in Episode 2 that I had to do over multiple times. One in particular essentially required me to get a headshot with every pull of the trigger, while dodging charge attacks and fireballs; as you might imagine, the exhilaration of toppling the guy was immense.', 'Considering both character pairs  Claire and Moira and Barry and Natalie  are unevenly balanced in terms of physical strength, such encounters require strategy, particularly when playing split-screen co-op. As the toughness ramps up, Moiras weaknesses are put into stark relief; without a weapon, theres little she can do but run. This can become frustrating, but on the other hand, it can be a thrill to play as the bait for your partners trap, if youve got the cojones for it. That youre required to be so considered in co-op is a strength of Episode 2.', 'More teamwork is required in this episode in general, and its better for it. Natalias formerly useless pointing ability is suddenly given meaning in the presence of invisible enemies that only she can see, and her ability to see monsters through walls lends itself to a stealthy approach. The Last of Us vibe I felt in the first episode is even more prominent here, and the occasional opportunity to not go in shooting is refreshing.', 'On the other hand, I continue to find Revelations 2s environments bland. While crumbling villages and deserted medical centers might be a traditional staple of the Resident Evil series, theyre boring, and the lack of environmental detail seems odd in 2015. Boxy design made sense in the Revelations console port in 2012, given its 3DS origins, but here its less excusable.', 'Fortunately, Raid Mode continues to offer more variation, with its colourful urban arenas and the odd level plucked from Revelations Queen Zenobia. Episode 2 unlocks two new characters to play, Pedro and Gabe, whose Drill Charge and Ground Pound specials are wonderfully efficient at clearing out big groups of enemies quickly.']",IGN
52,Final Fantasy Type-0 HD,16-Mar-15,Meghan Sullivan,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/16/final-fantasy-type-0-hd-review,"['Final Fantasy: Type-0 had me in tears after watching a chocobo bleed to death in the opening scene, and for the next 40 hours I would experience everything from sadness to disbelief as the thin but reverent story unfolded. During that same time, the zippy action-based combat made running around the world of Orience a lively experience, though viewed through an occasionally obstinate camera. Type-0 has a strange dichotomy of action and emotion, but it comes together to create a roleplaying game that works on multiple levels.', 'Everything in Type-0 is tied to war, which makes for some intriguing presentation of the usual Final Fantasy features. Magic comes in the form of fire bombs, lightning missiles, and ice bullets, while the story progresses via military campaigns that involve liberating towns, defending bases, and invading cities. Even chocobos are bred for war; I liked that by capturing birds in the wild and correctly breeding them, you can hatch combat-ready chocobos that help fight in sorties, or can race across the world map to quickly arrive at a destination.', 'The tale of an elite group of young cadets fighting an aggressive military empire serves as a reminder that its the young who die in war, and who are the first to be forgotten. Class Zeros emotional struggles  like watching friends die on the battlefield and then feeling guilty because theyre unable to remember them, is incredibly moving. Unfortunately, the cringe-worthy voice acting in the English-language version sometimes distracted from the solemnity, especially when the class loudmouth Nine kept adding yo and hey after every bloody sentence. Luckily, there are humorous moments sprinkled in to lighten the mood and keep the story from getting too dark; I laughed out loud when a saucy cadet named Carla sweet-talked a military instructor, then turned around to brag about her manipulation skills.', 'Campaigns that involve running through city streets or infiltrating fortresses were pretty fun, but I had a hard time with the real-time strategy missions that popped up here and there. I nearly rage quit one operation because the stubborn camera and clunky controls made it hard for me to move around the battlefield. These annoying mechanical issues were inherited from the original PSP version of Type-0 (which was released exclusively in Japan back in 2011), along with a few other noticeable limitations: NPCs have blocky faces, wall textures are blurred and jaggy, and dungeons and towns are little more than long, monochromatic corridors. I was so bored by most environments that I stopped caring about them halfway through the story.', 'That said, the HD graphics in Type-0 definitely have some wonderful lighting and shading effects. This is especially apparent in the central hub area of Akademia, where marble floors gleam with a fine polish, and beams of sunlight stream brightly through large glass windows.  CGI cutscenes are especially well done, with detailed animations of Eidolons soaring through the sky, and brutal close-ups of soldiers being slaughtered on the ground. Developer Hexa Drive did a great job bringing these powerful scenes to full-sized TV screens.', 'Final Fantasy Type-0s best feature, though, is the rapid, action-based combat that allows you to mix and match party members to create versatile three-man squads on the battlefield. Each member of Class Zero has their own distinct weapons, abilities, combat styles, and speeds, which makes them feel like real individuals: Jack is slow-moving but can easily slice through monsters with his sword, Seven can nimbly dodge enemy soldiers while using her chain whip to deal out vicious attacks, and Rem can use her Undying Wish spell to temporarily prevent cadets from falling on the battlefield. And if one of your team members does fall, you can immediately summon another cadet from Class Zeros reserves to replace them, or call on a powerful Eidolon to help thin out enemy ranks. (Eidolons tend to be unwieldy, though, and require the sacrifice of one of your party members in order to summon them.) You can even request NPC support units from Akademia to help you on campaigns, which is a nice way to earn special points that can be used to acquire rare items.', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'Whether I was fighting mundane soldiers or taking on more exciting enemies like poison-spitting serpents and giant, angry snow beasts, I felt powerful because the combat was always super fast paced. In fact, many victories were achieved in less than a minute using the handy ""kill sight"" and ""break sight"" features, which allow cadets to heavily damage or even instantly kill an enemy with a well-timed attack.', 'Levelling up so many cadets in order to make sure they were all combat ready required a lot of patience, but I didnt mind since Type-0 includes a nice array of ways to beef up your characters. You can accept side quests from NPCs, train at Akademias battle arena, increase magic skills by attending a lecture, participate in random battles on the world map, or re-do story campaigns accessed from the main menu.', 'It may seem like its easy to overpower Class Zero, but almost everything you do is tied to the limited amount of free time you have between military campaigns. This clever bit of time management forced me to think carefully about which activities I participated in: did I want to spend two hours talking to an NPC, or leave Akademia and lose six hours so I could go on a monster hunt? Time was of the essence, and I enjoyed having to use it wisely.', 'Finally, I had a little bit of an issue with the convoluted ending, which requires a second playthrough and a lot of reading up on Oriences lore to fully comprehend. I didnt mind relying on the in-game compendium for some things, but having to bend over backwards to understand whats going on didnt add anything to the story.']",IGN
53,Sid Meier's Starships,13-Mar-15,Dan Stapleton,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/13/sid-meiers-starships-review,"['Ive gotten a few good turn-based fleet engagements out of Sid Meiers Starships, but they feel like the quick tactical minigame component of a larger, more complex strategy game that isnt here. Instead we get a confusing galactic conquest game that moves too fast for its own good. WIthout the support and context of a thoughtful war, Starships hex-based battles lost their luster after just a couple of days.', 'When youre first setting out from your homeworld with a two-ship fleet to win independent planets over to your cause before rival empires do, mission variety is pretty good: escorting a friendly ship to a destination, preventing an enemy from reaching theirs, navigating a maze of asteroids while handicapped by a limited view distance, taking out a VIP enemy ship, hunting stealth fighters  there are quite a few. The problem is, most of those missions are either extremely easy due to the barely upgraded ships having few capabilities (just zip behind your target and blast their weak rear shields at point-blank range for one-shot kills), or so hard my entire fleet was wiped out on the first turn  effectively ending the game before it got started.', 'Upgrading your individual ships is one of the coolest things about Starships, because theyll change appearance based on every point you plug into engines, shields, armor, long or short-range weapons, stealth, sensors, torpedoes, or fighters. That creates a wide variety of ship design variations stemming from the three base vessels (associated with which starting bonus you pick for your faction). Those choices are meaningful, too, since a ship with fast engines and close-range weaponry has very different utility from a slow one that sits in the rear launching long-range torpedoes and fighters.', 'Other than that, though, Starships doesnt look great - even for a game clearly designed to run on the iPad. Ships get some good beauty shots thanks to the action camera, which shows projectiles launching and hitting targets, but the weapon and explosion effects are so poor Im surprised Firaxis wanted the camera anywhere near them. Plus, the many asteroids that serve as cover for ship battles look terrible. Ive even had intermittent but major frame rate problems on both PC and my iPad 3, which doesnt make a lot of sense.', 'In later, more tactically interesting battles, fleets become large and durable enough to trade blows for a while, sometimes scoring random critical hits that disable shields, engines, or weapons. I find myself easily winning battles in which the mission select screen predicts I have less than 40% chance of victory, because after all, a single-player tactical game is only as good as its AI. This AI is just alright.', 'Torpedoes battles are some of the best fun. You launch them on one turn, and then on the next they continue on that course as you view them from a chase-cam perspective. Hitting a button to detonate them at the right moment to catch an enemy ship (or two) in the blast radius is an interesting dash of real-time action added to a turn-based tactical game, and a clever means of area-denial. Equipping a fleet of four ships with torpedo launchers and blanketing an entire area with them is a great tactic for demolishing an entire fleet in one of the larger battles to take an enemy homeworld. It would be a great mind-game weapon to use in multiplayer... if Starships had multiplayer. Which it doesnt. Also, the iOS versions controls make targeting these warheads a huge pain.', 'After one of those big battles, the strategic game falls apart a bit. Because each empire has only one fleet, if you soundly defeat a rival in combat once, you can basically roll through all their territory until youve used up all your fleets stamina. Or, the same thing can happen to you - one bad battle can mean the whole thing comes crumbling down. Its especially confusing to watch that happen, because during the AI turns everything moves so fast its hard to know whats going on, and theres no meaningful summary of events. Big swaths of the galaxy can change hands quickly, meaning there may be nothing you can do to stop a swing that puts a rival faction over the 51% galactic territory control they need to win suddenly.', 'Within a day, Id won my first game on Hard difficulty - and thats before I understood half of the mechanics, like why I had to manage five different resources. If you can get hold of a couple of the exceptionally powerful Wonders  such as the one that lets you launch fighters that can attack on that same turn and the one that lets you move first in every battle  mopping up the opposition in just a few hours becomes a cakewalk even if youve ignored much of the complexity of upgrading your planets resource production and disregarded the rudimentary diplomacy system entirely.']",IGN

Built on the same tenants as 2005s fantastic Kirby: Canvas Curse for the original DS, this Wii U sequel places all of the power in your stylus, which makes for a refreshing experience that feels different than most 2D platformers. Its dependence on touch controls make it a slightly awkward fit for the Wii U, but this beautiful world looks and plays great on the GamePad.', ""Like in the DS original, you don't directly control Kirby in the traditional platforming sense. Instead, you rely on the stylus to draw a track using a finite amount of rechargeable ink for the little pink puff to roll on. Its sort of a weird concept to wrap your head around at first, but once I settled into a groove, I was avoiding enemies, building momentum downhill, and completing levels without ever letting Kirby touch the ground. More complex tactics, like blocking projectiles with hand-drawn walls and collecting 100 stars to transform into a giant bullet make control of Kirby a deep, and rewarding endeavor."", '\n', 'And youll definitely need to hit your groove, because Rainbow Curse quickly bares its adorable fangs. One-hit kill enemies, tricky bosses, and levels littered with traps make for some really tough, but ultimately rewarding challenges. That might be a little scary if you were hoping to share this cartoonish-looking game with a more novice gaming partner, but the good news here is that 1UPs are in abundance, so having to replay a particularly tricky section isnt the end of the world.', ""Rainbow Curses 28 stages, which took me about seven hours to get through, keep you moving at a brisk pace. Levels change in style and layout all the time, and throw in some much-appreciated variety like these vehicular stages. That said, I felt that the average level by and large was a bit too long. Canvas Curse kept stages to brief, tight challenges that brought back shades of Super Mario 3's brevity, whereas this follow-up tends to deliver a few too many levels that outstay their welcome."", 'While I loved making my way through the levels for their visual variety and beauty -- going from sunken ships to cloud kingdoms to fiery volcanoes made the adventure fly by in a breeze -- I never really felt the urge to stop and collect the wealth of doo-dads scattered across the world. Where a game like Yoshis Island encouraged 100% completion in order to unlock some of its finest stages, Kirbys in-game trophies, statues, and music samples didnt really entice me to dig into every nook and cranny.', 'So lets talk about the elephant in the room: Kirby and the Rainbow Curse is absolutely gorgeous. The entire world and all of its inhabitants have a unique, hand-molded look to them that makes it unmistakable among its peers. It joins the ranks of Tearaway, Okami, and a handful of other fantastic experiences that truly feel like youre playing inside of a tangible world. Small touches, like fingerprint indentations on character models, separate Kirby from any other game out there. Particularly impressive are the bosses. The iconic Whispy Woods huffs and puffs like a stop-motion creature ripped straight out of a Laika movie.', '\n', 'The tactile nature of the world doesnt just come across aesthetically, but also in the way you interact with the each level. Chip away at blocks of clay and using your rainbow powers to shield yourself from waterfalls really helped solidify the bond between my hand and the game world.', ""That said, the stylus-focused nature of the mechanics means you have to keep your eyes on the Wii U GamePad at all times, meaning that you miss out on the full beauty on your television. To soak in all the detail, Id rather watch someone play than play again myself. Speaking of, Rainbow Curse supports up to three additional players, each of which can control their own Waddle and help maneuver Kirby around the world. It doesn't really add a whole lot to the experience, but the drop-in, drop-out nature of the multiplayer makes it a nice experiment to test out."", '\n']",IGN

Ive heard this voice and its message before, and I know Ill be hearing it countless more times. With no saves or checkpoints, such is your often short-lived existence in the bleak and somber 2D action platformer world of Oblitus. How you decide to live that life makes up some of its best moments, while the manner in which you die often highlights its weaknesses.', '', '', '', 'Finding the speaker, Mudd, wherever he has randomly decided to spawn will mean defeating a towering and fearsome boss in one of three foreboding zones. Doing so will grant you passage to the final treacherous area, and whether you win or lose, the cycle will continue regardless. This type of conclusion may feel like a non-ending, and its not readily apparent that one of the few things that carries over is the collection of a hidden artifact piece that can unlock a true ending, especially if you missed it during your run. A skilled player can get to the end in just 25 minutes or less, but rest assured you will be spending countless hours (and deaths) building up to your perfect run, and countless more with the promise of unlocking new enhancements and the true ending. Even though only a few enemy placements, side paths, and item locations actually change in each iteration, it remains enjoyable enough that youll be constantly testing new strategies and trying to find the best upgrades - and getting the power of slow-falling wings, rapid-fire spears, or fire enchanted armor can make your run wildly different from not getting any upgrades at all.\n\n\n', '', 'Beyond telling you where Mudd and the chosen giant you must face are located, figuring out where you are and where youre going is quite a task - especially as you acclimate yourself to Oblitus beautiful, treacherous terrain. The painted art style highlights the towering woods, the steep slopes leading to a large furnace in the sky, and the soft glow of luminescent plants deep below the earth. For all its beauty, the art can occasionally get in its own way, as the line between foreground and background can get so blurry that I found myself jumping for a length of chain that was never actually there, or getting backed into a corner thanks to a tree branch that I hadnt realized was on my 2D plane.', 'One location in particular, the caves, adds to this confusion. With the somewhat random nature of Oblitus, this may be your first destination, and if so, youre in for an unintuitive search just to actually reach it. The other locations lie to your right or left and are easy to find, but if you go looking in the direction youd expect to find caves (down) you can expect a fiery death instead. This doesnt feel right since the game never communicates that Id need to go through an entire area just to reach the caves. Once I found them however, the caves backdrops meshed well with the somber music to punctuate the lonely feeling of trekking through a harsh alien world full of creatures just waiting to tear me apart.\n\n\n', '', 'The only tools youll have to beat back the cycle of death are your spear and shield, a combination Im happy to see to shine in the spotlight. By moving the mouse in a circle around your character, you can target enemies from all sides and angles. This allows for precision stabbing and spear throwing, which youll need to bypass enemy armor and shields to find their weak points. Hit the wrong spot, and youll be thrown off balance by their defense, and suffer a vicious counterattack. Tossing your spear will let you play it safe from a distance, but also leaves you vulnerable and weaponless for a few moments, making it a risky tactic. As I slowly mastered the art of thrusting and blocking, dodge-rolling into spear vaults over danger, and launching my spear to watch it deliciously sink into the exposed necks of my enemies, it became apparent that no two fights in Oblitus play out the exact same way. The ever-changing nature of Oblitus further punctuates the need for caution, as an empty corridor during one run may contain a giant rock beast during your next run.', 'Oblitus isnt exactly bursting with enemies to fight, but it makes sure that most every enemy you brandish your spear at will be a carefully pitted fight. Whether it be an armor-clad bipedal reptile with a spike for a hand, or a giant cave-dwelling bear with fire engulfing its hide, you can bet that charging in blindly stabbing will only send you back to the beginning - all of your hard-won progress lost in the blink of an eye.\n\n\n', '', 'Defeating enemies will only slightly regenerate a fraction of the health theyve taken from you, and the large boss enemies will lop off huge chunks of your health with every landed blow, which makes for some very intense battles. Its a shame that two of the four bosses become highly predictable after the few runs it takes to get used to their attack patterns, but the other two made me see the benefit of seeking out the optional, randomly generated weapon and magic enhancements found in secret areas, or on the bodies of other fallen bosses. This forms a great sense of risk-reward, as trying to get that explosive-impact enhancement for your spear can easily get you killed by the rock golem guarding it.', 'When death comes for you in this game, it imparts wisdom, teaching you which mistakes are best avoided, unless of course, it cant be. While most areas in the game let you fall from any height without fear of death or injury, two areas in the game contain veritable pits of death, and unfortunately look no different from your usual drop between platforms. This becomes especially frustrating in the last area of the game, where the path to the boss leads you ever deeper into the earth, and you can find death at the bottom of a lava pit because you cant look before you leap.']",IGN

Seconds later a car went up in flames, causing hidden explosives to detonate and demolish not one, but three buildings, which crumbled spectacularly. In Screamride, I flung, flipped, and exploded ride testers in the name of science, built roller coasters of doom, and defied gravity while speeding through twisting coaster tracks  and I had a ton of fun doing it.', ""Screamride doesn't have a prominent story in its career mode, beyond some background radio chatter that explain tidbits about its world.

It wasnt terrible, but it did pull me out of my adrenaline rush.', 'Those performance woes are odd, because Demolition Expert mode doesnt share them, and its much more about breaking things for entertainment. Using small coaster cars and two-person cabins, I flung ride testers into explosives, magnets, and other objects to help me do the most damage possible. The quality of the physics of each building tumbling down or exploding is impressive  instead of disappearing into the nether, a structures rubble piles up beautifully and can even pose as another obstacle. Explosions are especially satisfying to watch, as they usually cause a massive chain reaction. It was fun to just chuck the cars at buildings randomly, but Demolition Expert was even better when I finally figured out the cadence of each level.', 'Trampolines scattered in the water taunted me to hit them in a perfect order. Then Id see flashing red explosives in a building not too far off that I could hit with the long-distance car. Theres an unexpected amount of strategy required to get the biggest explosions  and thus the highest scores  and it was incredibly satisfying when I finally set off a chain reaction. Screamride allows for some flexibility, though, so you could fling cars without planning and still be able to pass the level.', 'With Engineer mode, I was given all the right tools to create my own awesome rides and death traps alike. Engineer is very similar to the Sandbox mode, but here there are restrictions in place that challenge your ability to manage resources. Some levels require you to connect several track pieces together while maintaining a high speed. Others would fail you lose any riders  yeah, if your G-Force is too intense, riders will fly out of their cart. I like how it doesnt make you guess where you mess up, giving helpful hints by marking your trouble spots and where you hit achievements like high speeds.', 'Constructing roller coasters in Engineer mode is a nice break from the chaos of the other two jobs; the music is relaxing, and the controls are simple yet complex enough to build intricate coasters. There are quite a few special loops, twists, reverse turns, jumps, and other special pieces that award extra points when used. For example, theres an ejection piece that launches a few riders out of their seats which is useful if youre trying to damage buildings or hit explosives.', 'Regrettably, this mode has some wonky camera angles. In one level I ended up staring at a pillar surrounded by water while I heard buildings crumbling. Whether I wanted to prevent future disasters or observe the results of my intentional one, thats annoying.', 'My frustrations didnt stop there. Out of the six areas in Screamride, the last two had an annoying difficulty spike that didnt really flow with the rest, which had progressed wonderfully with steady and enjoyable challenges. Even so, I found myself replaying the challenging levels as the leaderboards inspired me to beat my previous score.', 'All the tools and lessons learned throughout the career mode culminate in Sandbox mode. Some of the cool amusement rides and building blueprints are locked until you reach a certain level in career mode, but theres enough to play with if youre only interested in creating levels. There are tons of building pieces in all sorts of materials and colors, so youre not limited to just building roller coasters  you can design an entire island, its buildings, and attractions piece by piece, or you can use blueprints to speed up the process. Sandbox modes tools surpass Engineers, such as with the very handy copy-and-paste tool that makes creation fast and simple. While this mode mostly gives you free reign, there is a limit to how many total pieces you can use and the maps have size restrictions, but I never found these to be severe limitations.', 'Its easy to jump between creating and testing, so I could constantly check whether or not my ride functioned, or exploded, properly. If I liked a specific ride or building, I could select the structure or a section of it and save it as a blueprint. Whats cooler is that I could then share that blueprint or the entire level by uploading it to the Level Center. Playing and downloading other players levels is just as simple.']",IGN
57,Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor: The Bright Lord,24-Feb-15,Dan Stapleton,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/24/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor-the-bright-lord-review,"['When I play an expansion like Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordors The Bright Lord, I have to wonder if developers sometimes misunderstand what made their game so successful in the first place. In this DLC, Monolith goes out of its way to make up for the lackluster final boss fight in the main game by adding a challenging face-off with Sauron himself, but takes steps backwards when it comes to the reason I really loved Mordor: its dynamic uruk enemies that created countless mini-boss battles throughout the campaign.', ""A flashback story puts us in the still-corporeal shoes of Celebrimbor, as Sauron abducts his family. We know how this ends, and there are no twists  just Celebrimbor and Sauron smack-talking like pro wrestlers for four or five hours as you take over the Undun section of Shadow of Mordor's map (again)."", ""The good news is that Celebrimbors combat style shakes things up. Compared to Talion, hes much more about branding enemies stealthily or in bulk and building up an army, using his Shadow Brand ability to brainwash any enemy you can see, or his improved Wraith Flash to brand multiple enemies at once. You can even summon a posse of pre-mind-controlled uruks to your side at almost any time. Those are wildly powerful moves (and hordes of glowing-eyed uruks can take a toll on frame rates), but they're kept in check by the fact that Celebrimbor can't take as much punishment as Talion, so every so often you have to massacre them all to restore your life and start the cycle over. Archery takes more skill, too, because you dont get the slow-motion effect when you draw your bow anymore, so it's way harder to headshot your way through a crowd of incoming uruks."", 'But Celebrimbor is wearing The One Ring, which he can charge up by branding enemies and activate for slow-mo and infinite, unblockable execution moves for around 30 seconds. (And that\'s before doing any side missions to upgrade the duration.) The effect of this power on Mordor\'s memorable Captain and Warchief fights is completely ruinous. Even though uruks can now reach level 25, any fight can be won by simply activating the ring and mashing the execute buttons until its all over - their resistances are completely nullified. Its the same ridiculous ""win-button"" mistake Warner made with Batman: Arkham Origins Shock Gauntlets, and here you start out with it from the beginning. Power like this defeats the purpose of combat and makes wins feel unearned, and I found myself avoiding using it except when I absolutely needed to.', 'Also, The Bright Lord actually makes its Warchiefs and Captains feel less dynamic. You cant kill Warchiefs, only dominate them, because theyre actors in the story. Meanwhile, there are no captains jockeying for position or advancing independently of your actions in the background, so there are no dynamic duels, feasts, or executions to interrupt. It makes the world feel static and scripted, which is a shame, because the behavior of those enemies is what I like best about the main game.', 'That final boss battle, though, is pretty good. Its built around managing a large crowd of enemies to build up your powers before taking on the big threat, which is a heck of a lot more interesting than a quick-time event. I just wish the rest of The Bright Lord were built around enhancing Mordors strengths rather than patching up its weaknesses.']",IGN
58,Sunless Sea,19-Feb-15,Rob Zacny,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/19/sunless-sea-review,"[""To understand why Sunless Sea is such a special roguelike, consider some of the places I've visited lately in my travels as a lone ship's captain in the whimsically Gothic world of the Neath, where the entire city of Victorian London has landed after being abducted by magical forces."", 'There\'s an island called Nuncio, filled with former postal workers. Its shores are covered in undelivered mail. There is a ""Dead-letter Office"" where a friendly rat-engineer used a special machine to retrieve and restore damaged post. In the basement, a storage room opens into a seemingly bottomless cavern, where all the misdirected mail of all the ages has gone to die.', ""There's Port Cecil, where everyone obsessively plays chess with pieces of carved gemstone. When my captain sat down to play, he went into a trance and began making moves according to the will of the primeval forces that govern the underworld, and played until his hands began to bleed."", 'Then I sailed onward to Mt. Palmerston, where I had tea with a lonely deviless who guards the road to a hellish volcano. She was charming and generous, and was very polite when she asked me to give her my soul.', ""There is a mix of offbeat charm and profound, uneasy weirdness that permeates every inch of Sunless Sea. It's a testament to developer Failbetter Games' tremendous writers that this world, built almost entirely through text dialog boxes and suggestive map art, is so absorbing."", ""But here's the rub: Sunless Sea is as much a text adventure (or hyperlink adventure, if you prefer) as it is a naval-combat roguelike. While most of your time in the game is spent piloting a tiny ship around the darkened Unterzee, encountering sea monsters and pirates, and discovering new islands and ports, much of the action unfolds via the act of reading snippets of text and then choosing from among a menu of options."", ""This is familiar territory for people who've played Failbetter's Fallen London, a free text adventure. But for people expecting something a bit more like Sid Meier's Pirates, where different actions and encounters throw you into a different minigame, much of Sunless Sea might seem passive."", ""It doesn't help that combat isn't all that involving. Enemies just slug away at you, and many of them can be easily outmaneuvered, especially if there are any rocks or inlets to help you confuse them. I rarely had much trouble taking on a bigger ship or a giant sea monster if I had a halfway decent gun and some hitpoints to spare."", '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'The thing is, Sunless Sea really is about the journey  and I don\'t mean that metaphorically. Where skill and experience come into play is in how you manage the precious resources of fuel, food, and sanity in your travels. Fuel and supplies are fairly expensive, and there are very few ""milk-run"" type journeys you can make. Sunless Sea consistently pushes you to explore farther, to risk more, and make bolder gambles.', 'When they pay off, you come back into port full of valuable loot: the Admiralty will pay well for maps and intelligence. An Alarming Scholar will reward you handsomely for forbidden knowledge and rare specimens. The market is always hungry for exotic, foreign goods. One cruise can give you enough money to buy better equipment for your ship, fill it to the brim with fuel and food that could take you around the world, and recruit some of the best officers money can buy.', ""When your risks don't turn out, you perish. Your crew goes mad somewhere at sea, because the Unterzee is so scary and wrong that just sailing its waters will drive people crazy over time. Or you run out of fuel and have to abandon ship, and nobody ever makes it home. Or your crew starves and turns to cannibalism."", 'You can hedge your bets by making some decisions along your journey. Engaging sea monsters is dangerous, because even though they are easy to kite, they pack a big wallop if they manage even a single hit. It\'s worth the risk, though, because killing them often yields up some food and some valuable goodies. Pirate ships are another dangerous opponent, but they frequently yield fuel and supplies after you vanquish them. The better you know the ocean, the more you can plot your routes to take you past more ports and lighted buoys, which prevent your crew from gaining ""terror,"" a value that steadily climbs when you\'re in the open ocean. Learning the ways you can push your luck, and navigational tricks that conserve resources and sanity, is one of the great pleasures of Sunless sea.', ""Even when you make mistakes or just have bad luck, all is not lost when your captain dies. You get a new one right away, and usually something will carry over from your last captain, even if it's just some money and a ship's gun. But each time, you know a bit more about the world, and what you'll find out at sea, and can play a bit more aggressively based on what you know."", ""Not everything is the same, though, as the Unterzee itself changes for each captain. An island might move across the ocean from where you last found it, and different things happen at different ports, playing out differently based on what's going on in the world at the time. That keeps each playthrough pretty fresh."", ""At the same time, the full reset of the Unterzee can be kind of demoralizing. Not just because of the loss of a character  I was crushed when I lost a really successful captain, who had explored a tremendous amount of the world and finished a huge number of storylines at various ports of call  but because not enough is changed. With his death, everything went back to the starting line and I had to repeat many of the same quests I'd done before.\n"", ""That's not quite as bad as it sounds, though. While it's a shame to just click past so much of the story after you've read it a couple times, the world and your needs change just enough that you won't always want to make the exact same choices each time through. I also ended up taking a lot of satisfaction in just how much easier progress became the more I played. My first expeditions were cautious grinds through the ocean, but by the time my fourth or fifth captain took to the sea, I was able to make up my lost progress in just a few voyages, and make some different story choices along the way. Frustration proved fleeting, and it was never long before I found myself launching Sunless Sea for just another couple voyages into the darkness.""]",IGN
59,Resident Evil Revelations 2 -- Episode 1,24-Feb-15,Lucy O'Brien,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/24/resident-evil-revelations-2-episode-1-review,"['No longer restricted by the limitations of a handheld original, the first episode in the sequel to 2012s Resident Evil: Revelations delivers a tight and fluid action experience on current-gen consoles, with plenty of excellent options for co-operative play. While it curiously under-delivers on imagination where locations and enemies are concerned, Episode 1: Penal Colony marks the start of a confident action-horror story which contains enough pulp to leave me eager for the next three episodes.', '\n', 'Episode 1 dances between two pairs of familiar and not-so-familiar Resident Evil faces: Barry Burtons teenage daughter Moira and Claire Redfield, and in a distinctively Last of Us-esque combo, Barry himself and Natalia, a little girl with strange powers. The mysteries in Episode 1 are big and juicy, and not over-explained; a relief considering Resident Evils tendency towards convoluted exposition.', 'Further, its all a lot less po-faced than I have come to expect from this series, thanks to accomplished voice acting, amusing interplay between Claire and Moira, and some healthy self-deprecation (at one point, Claire mutters I was almost a Claire sandwich, followed by some severe eye-rolling). In a series so often bogged down in big science and ultra-seriousness, I enjoyed the dark humour.', 'I was also relieved to find that significant improvements have been made to character mobility since the last Revelations. The dodge move, haphazardly implemented in the original,  is now easy to execute, and the quick turn similarly more intuitive. Theres a lot less stopping and starting in Revelations 2, and a lot more running and dodging; in other words, its kept up with modern action games.', 'Co-op is now available in Revelations 2 from the get-go, and it works well. After the last games disappointingly useless puppet AI, remembered mostly for pumping ineffective rounds into enemies to give the illusion of teamwork, its great to see that this time round he or she has a particular skill that is essential on the battlefield. Moiras flashlight can be used to blind enemies and find hidden objects, while Natalia can crawl through tiny spaces, throw bricks, and use her sight to see enemies before Barry can.', 'You can - and will likely want to - switch between characters on the fly. Although I would have liked more co-op puzzle solving, split-screen combat dynamics are particularly fun; as one character in each pair is significantly under-powered against enemies, you must learn to communicate with your partner in order to stay alive.', 'With the moment-to-moment gameplay so well orchestrated, I was surprised at how uninspiring Episode 1s environments are. The prison where most of the action takes place is dull, its rooms and corridors dark and grainy and painfully samey, without an eccentric puzzle or elaborate trap to be seen. Such boring design feels like a real backstep, considering the grand, ornate interiors of the Queen Zenobia in the original Revelations (and indeed, the gorgeous interiors of the original Resident Evil). All told, the first episodes campaign took me roughly three and half hours, though I imagine this would have been a significantly smaller number had I not spent so much time going round in circles.', 'Enemy designs, too, lack imagination here. In 2015, brainless shamblers are merely heads to be popped, and in this episode at least, youll pop them easily. Considering how the Resident Evil series has evolved over the years, its barely worth pointing out that Revelations 2 sits more comfortably in the gung-ho action genre than in the one labelled survival horror, and I do recommend you play through the campaign on the harder difficulty if youre looking for real challenge.', 'Fortunately, the Raid minigame is once again a highlight, played either solo or in split-screen co-op. These furious shooting-galleries - where the ultimate goal is to kill all the enemies in an arena below your level without healing yourself  - do offer real challenge; at least if you want to complete each at 100% in order to unlock the best bonuses you can. Theres a great deal of depth to Raids customization, via skill trees and collectable weapons, while beginner stats differ from character to character, making for interesting combos in co-op. For score chasers, this mode promises a great deal of longevity outside of the main campaign.']",IGN
60,Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered,12-Feb-15,Dave Rudden,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/12/fahrenheit-indigo-prophecy-remastered-review,"[""When it originally released in late 2005, Indigo Prophecy was both ahead of and an unfortunate product of its time. Its concept of controlling both a crime and its investigation from different perspectives, coupled with a timer-based dialogue system, created the sort of storytelling fluctuation and intensity that Telltale made its name on in recent years. Unfortunately, some of the last decade's worst ideas are present, too, with annoyingly frequent quick-time events acting as a substitute for genuine action and awful stealth sequences that often derailed my effort to enjoy Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered's visual upgrades and still-gripping story."", ""A majority of that story stays grounded by focusing in on three endearing characters. Lucas Kane struggles with being accused of a crime he doesn't remember committing and equally mysterious superpowers he's developed. Detectives Carla Valenti and Tyler Miles must uncover the deeper mystery as Carla becomes consumed and Tyler questions his dedication. The initial weirdness of tackling both sides of a case quickly subsided, as I rarely felt the need to intentionally sabotage anything on either side. If anything, seeing the twists created for the detectives due to Lucas' prior actions gives reason to be as thorough a fugitive and investigator as possible. This is due in no small part to the opening diner setting, which has so many permutations on both the criminal and investigation side that it's difficult to resist the urge to start over again a few times to see what mightve happened. Fortunately for me, the multi-platform release provided that opportunity, as I tried the scene out on both mobile and PC platforms."", ""The ahead-of-its-time dialogue system where characters have a limited window to react (they default to the worst response if time expires) adds a much-needed sense of urgency to the adventure game-style proceedings. Long before Mass Effect and Walking Dead based major character moments on quick decisions, personal relationships and the direction of the investigation hinge on big decisions made in a small amount of time. Some of the text descriptions don't quite match what is actually said by the protagonists when theyre selected, and the system doesn't carry the gravity of modern adventures and RPGs, but it holds up far better than most decade-old gaming systems."", ""With an oppressive snowstorm turning New York into a ghost town, the cast is quite small, but the few partners, relatives, and friends are enough to flesh out the main characters. It's only when the story moves beyond the slightly offbeat occult mystery into an overwritten reality-questioning mess that Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered stops being a gripping mystery adventure. Fortunately, by that point the end is so close you'll probably just want to see where the madness leads."", ""While there's a few miscast characters (and some supposed natives fail to display any sort of New York accent) the voice acting is almost at the level of today's top adventures. When the soundtrack sticks to the orchestrated score, it's near-Hollywood level, but the licensed songs can't consistently claim the same quality. While there's some good songs that play during the detectives downtime, Lucas' actions are underscored by grating mid-2000s nu-metal that hasn't been updated for the times."", ""The major updates in Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered come in the form of updated graphics and new control options, but as welcome as both are, they cause new issues on PC and mobile devices, respectively. The improvement in texture quality and high-definition optimization make some of the characters (particularly Carla and to a lesser extent, Lucas) look as though they could star in an adventure from five years ago rather than almost 10. However, many NPCs and co-star Tyler still have painted-on expressions that don't befit the Remastered moniker, and the inconsistency is more distracting than if theyd never been updated at all."", 'More distressing than some of the cut corners are the many new bugs that have come with this reissue. From a weird quirk that keeps Steam account names with certain symbols (such as |) from even starting a game, to frequent crashes accompanied by characters falling out of the environment, the stability of a two-generation-old version sometimes becomes more attractive than any upgrade. As far as controls go, the annoyingly hyperactive button-prompt sequences remain unmanageable regardless of whether you choose to use a controller or a keyboard on PC. On mobile devices (where crashes are far less frequent), tapping the prompts is a major improvement, but general movement and environment interactivity becomes a chore.', 'No matter which control scheme you decide on, the rare stealth sequences remain the biggest source of frustration. Even though only two of the almost 40 chapters include stealth, the lack of direction and feedback in those scenes makes those two so unfair that it almost overshadows the majority of what works within Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered.']",IGN
61,Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate,10-Feb-15,Jose Otero,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/10/monster-hunter-4-ultimate-review,"['After sinking 118 hours into its great predecessor in 2013, I wasnt sure if Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate could hook me again. Yet, after 20 hours, I cant stop playing. I want to fight more bosses, acquire more resources, and build incredible weapons and sets of armor. A new focus on making Monster Hunter a bit more accessible to new players hasnt caused this juggernaut to miss a beat, whether playing the solo campaign or with a four-person hunting party in online multiplayer.', 'Monster Hunter is best described as a greatest-hits collection of boss encounters. Each beast has a unique fighting style, and uses animated tells (instead of ugly health bars or icons) to allow you to stay out of harms way and counter attack if you react quickly. The new lemur-like Kecha Wacha, for example, uses long arms to swing around stages and pop out to surprise unaware hunters. That fight is completely different from going up against the returning gorilla monster Congalala, which uses brute-strength attacks and can cut farts that prevent you from healing.', 'Beating those monsters rewards you with resources, which are then used to construct cool new weapons and armor to slay more monsters. Its a fun loop thats kept fresh by smoothly increasing challenge, and a huge variety of opposition and weapon and gear types. The only times that threaten to break the cycle are a few dull missions that send you to collect eggs, mushrooms, or other raw materials. Those arent the monsters Im interested in hunting.', 'Most of these strengths Ive mentioned are carried over from previous games in the series, but Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate changes things up by adding interesting vertical thinking to the already staggeringly deep combat system. These more agile hunters can easily vault up surfaces or scramble up walls with a few button presses. It encourages moves like running, leaping, and bringing down a satisfying mid-air chop on creatures that hang out near a ledge.', 'All that complexity is daunting, but Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate is better at introducing new players to the fine art of slaying monsters than any previous game in the series. That said, it could still do a better job of communicating some essential ideas. The sheer variety of weapons open from the start can feel overwhelming and, since Monster Hunter relies on mostly text to explain how they work, picking the right one comes down to a lot of trial and error. Once you land on the right one for you, the experience gets much better from there, but it definitely requires a little patience.', 'Once you get the hang of them, these weapons deliver the same amazing variety and depth they have in previous Monster Hunter games. Each of the 14 weapons has layers of depth and nuance to wrap your head around. The Insect Glaive is one of my new favorites. It has the speed and reach of a nimble Long Sword, but is also home to a bug assistant that can be sent out to steal enemies essences and provide buffs for speed, attack, and defense. The ability to pole vault at any time also makes it the coolest-looking weapon of the bunch, and one that fits well with the more acrobatic combat. A runner-up is the mighty Charge Axe, which has equally impressive properties that include charged-up attacks that deliver a satisfying wallop to enemies large and small.', 'Monster Hunter 4 Ultimates diverse locations show improvement over the prior game. The bustling town of Val Habar looks and feels significantly different to the ashy Harth. Each place and the subsequent areas that open up feel much more connected than in previous Monster Hunter games, and I was impressed to see the world change to reflect my actions in the solo campaign as my caravan of adventurers completed quests. The village of Harth came back to life by the end of my time there, with revived color, lava pathways, and animated villagers that looked much happier than when I first arrived. The campaign nails a satisfying feeling of accomplishment as the journey unfolds.', 'A few simple taps on the 3DS touch screen can quickly switch you between solo play and local or online multiplayer, which is a great ease-of-use improvement over previous portable versions of Monster Hunter. But since progression in solo campaign and multiplayer are counted separately, you have to repeat some of the most boring quests a second time. Its a tiny annoyance, relative to the grand scale of this game, but its unfortunate that this repetition means you have to repeat stuff that wasnt fun the first time. At these moments, Monster Hunter is trying to re-emphasize the importance of materials for building traps and potions, but these arent lessons worth learning twice.']",IGN
62,Hand of Fate,20-Feb-15,Leif Johnson,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/20/hand-of-fate-review,"[""Bandits are such punks. There I am, minding my own business as I mosey down a typical dark, wooded pathway, when suddenly boulders start falling down toward my head like Louisiana rain. Luckily I survive. But barely has the dust cleared before I hear one of the morons asking his buddies if I'm still alive, and after all I've been through  after goblin ambushes, plague-spitting rats, and grumpy merchants  it's just too much to handle. I jump up toward them, prepared to teach them a lesson with the business end of my axe, and you know what? I do. Acting out this scenario, which sprung from a the hand dealt to me in a virtual collectable card game, in real-time action gave me more enjoyment than I would ordinarily have gotten out of this kind of simple attack-and-counter combat."", ""It's a competent collectible card game on one level, yes, but it's also an action-RPG with little sprinkles of choose-your-own-adventure stylings thrown in for good measure. The key triumph of Hand of Fate is that, despite some complications with the action, it manages to juggle such motley components without dropping and shattering them and the fun."", 'It certainly doesn\'t hurt that this world oozes with personality, created by presenting a game within a game. My in-game character spends all of my sessions seated across a game table from a guy who looks like Richard the Warlock from the LFG webcomic, watching as he throws down cards with attractive art that draws obvious inspiration from Renaissance woodcuts. He\'s there for the duration, and it\'s a good thing that he\'s likable despite a faint air of menace. Always quick to deliver a dour quip in a sonorous voice (""For eons I have waited for an more appropriate player; it seems there are more eons ahead,"" as he says during a lull), he plays less like a Magic: The Gathering deckmaster and more like a tarot reader, revealing my fortune in familiar spreads like the Celtic Cross.', ""In a sense, he is: his face-down placement of the cards resembles the rough outlines of a dungeon map, and progression hinges on moving a golden gamepiece from card to card, turn by turn. It sounds a tad complex on paper, but it's easy to learn the rules and quirks just by playing. It's crafted so well that, early on, it does more to recapture the open-ended nature of old pen-and-paper Dungeons & Dragons sessions than games that bury you under arcane stats and scripted scenarios."", ""At the same time, it usually works so well in part because it's not completely random. My customized deck determines the possibilities of each level, and it's stuffed with cards for both weapons and encounters that I've won from tokens awarded after victories in the roughly 10-hour story mode. Early on I preferred the Helpful Priest card, which grants blessings if you give the poor sap half your food (the resource needed to make the jump from card to card). At other times I might uncover the Winding Trail, which might toss me into real-time battle for the chance to win access to one of the weapons I'd woven into my deck."", 'It\'s a setup that would quickly grow boring and predictable if left alone, but Hand of Fate wisely complicates things by letting the dealer tossing in curses that sap life or food, or, in his better moods, friendly priests that can undo the damage. If there\'s a problem, it\'s that he\'s a tad too generous for the first few hours, as food replenishes quickly enough to make failure a near-impossibility. True, the Rock Fall described above originated from his cards, and it could have ended in death had I not drawn a ""Success"" card from the four cards he slapped down in response. And then there\'s the combat, which occurs when I reveal a card for, say, Goblins, and the dealer draws a numbered card specifying how many goblins I fight.', 'The system smartly relies on risks for rewards. You start off with shabby gear with each ""level,"" but opportunities to pick up better stuff continually present themselves depending on how you\'ve structured your deck. Throw a ""Embertown Hero"" encounter card in your deck, for instance, and your travels might lead you to a dying knight who offers to give you that godly frost sword you stuffed in your deck if you agree to kill some random enemies for him.', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', ""It's a shame the combat encounters never enjoy the same sense of freshness of the card game that surrounds it. They're certainly attractive enough, and they feature a hero who looks like someone imported Ragnar from the History Channel's Viking series into the world of Fable II. (Tough luck if Ragnar's not your type, as customization's a disappointing no-no here.) Considering how brief they are, they're surprisingly visually diverse. Some maps feature our cartoony Ragnar dodging flame throwers and spikes in a maze; others have him bruising heads in a tavern or on the outskirts of a primeval forest."", 'Again, though, it\'s the combat itself that sags a tad. Consider it Batman: Arkham Asylum (or these days, Shadow of Mordor) lite. Our hero uses the X button on an Xbox controller to slash at the enemy, the Y button to counter after the prompt appears (if you were smart enough to stash a shield card in your deck somewhere), and the A button to dash out of harm\'s way. And that\'s about it. Sometimes I activated special abilities with the left and right bumpers, but battles usually end so quickly that it\'s rarely necessary save in the boss battles that cap each level. Battles never deviate from this structure, and their difficulty usually varies only in terms of how many enemies are on the field (although this gets quite difficult late in the game). If the dealer draws a Four of Skulls, you can rest assured you\'ll be fighting four skeletons, who take at most 30 seconds to kill. And so it goes on forever, particularly in the tremendously replayable ""Endless"" mode, which pushes you to outlast the dealer for as long as you can.', ""In such extended playthroughs, it's perhaps inevitable that the dull pangs of repetition set in, likely because Hand of Fates component features are relatively simple despite their depth when mashed together. On the bright side, I found that stepping away from the game for a few hours was enough to rekindle my interest. Usually I found myself more bothered by technical issues, such as the way the dealer's shuffling animation bogs the Xbox One down to a crawl or how the music and the dealer's voice often cut out on the PC version. Of the two I sampled, the Xbox One version seems far more stable.""]",IGN
63,The Escapists,13-Feb-15,Richard Cobbett,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/13/the-escapists-review,"['Theres a reason prison breaks happen far more often in fiction than reality: these places really dont mess around. Nor, despite what its cute graphics may suggest, does The Escapists. Its hardly a realistic simulation of life behind bars  with the prisoners quoting everything from famous movies to Breaking Bad  but its a fiendish little mix of sandbox and puzzle game whose six prisons take no prisoners. Metaphorically speaking, anyway...', 'Its a game that looks like Prison Architects black-sheep brother, but plays about as a regimented sandbox to first be controlled by, and then to subvert. Morning roll-call is time for everyone to gather and be told the business of the day, including whose cells are about to be inspected for contraband. Soon I realized its also a great time to sneak into other prisoners cells and carefully pocket anything good from their stash. Social times like dinner, meanwhile, offer a chance to chat with other prisoners, recruit assistance, and collect mini-quests like retrieving someones stolen DVD or causing a scene during the next roll-call.', 'How much you appreciate the result will primarily depend on two factors: whether you like being left alone to figure out what to do, because the basic tutorial covers very little of what you need to know to actually escape one of the real prisons, and how annoying this repetition is going to be over time. It takes a long series of days to gather and assemble the bits that you need for an escape, and its easy to lose all the important ones with just the slightest mistake. You can only save at the start of each in-game day, and while theres no death, being taken out by a random prisoner deciding they dont like your face, or a guard screwing up your plan at the last second, can make for an excruciating time-out and loss of hard-earned progress.', 'Each of the nine prisons offers a different-feeling challenge though, not to mention new settings, from minimum security with a cell conveniently located right by a service corridor, to a high-security facility for those who have officially transcended mere scamphood. The first has cable TV in all the rooms, the last has security cameras. Between them are a Stalag, Shankton State Pen, a jungle jail, and San Pancho, south of the border in a cloud of heat and anger. There are also currently three additional custom prisons, including Camp Epsilon, where all cells have mesh walls for an extra-special lack of privacy and most prison life is out in the open.', 'Mechanically of course, the goals are the same: find a weakness, and exploit it. Much of this revolves around crafting, which in a continuation of a frankly irritating current trend just assumes that youll go to a wiki to find out that, say, papier mache is made by combining toilet paper and superglue. Its hard to plan when you dont know what a game has actually planned for, especially when the character needs to hit an intelligence threshold to make so much as a glob of sticky paper. Providing the standard useful recipes up front would have been handy.', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'Much of The Escapists is about getting the items that you need to conduct a breakout - at its simplest, a Shawshank-style dodge like finding a tool to break through a wall, a poster to hide the evidence from the screws until its too late. You can buy both legal and contraband items from fellow prisoners, as well as get jobs around the prison that provide access to heftier things. The laundry shift, for instance, is a great way of getting your hands on a guard uniform, even if sensors on the door make stealing one a little harder than just walking off. If someone else has the job you want, well, thats what sharpening a comb on a wall to make an impromptu shank is for. The risk, of course, is that theyll later return the favour at the worst possible time, and lead to all your hard work turning into a spell in the infirmary/solitary.', 'Its this combination of relatively simple systems that makes The Escapists work so well, with a slow build up to the actual escape attempt. Where it falls down is that in addition to its routines and focus quickly becoming repetitive, it doesnt have much in the way of character. No, thats too strong  it has plenty on the surface, with its adorable 16-bit style graphics, cheery prison brawls, random pop-culture quoting, and the ability to name all the characters after friends, family, co-workers, teachers, or whatever. A few minutes in though, youre left in a world where everything is a pure puzzle game piece rather than a person, with no real sense of danger, and no characters to feel anything for beyond guy who will give me $28 for punching that guy. Theres none of the tension of even, say, Prison Break (the pretty good first series, not the terrible, terrible others) even in the most brutal, locked down jail you encounter, and after a while thats missed. The Escapists does a great job of turning prison escape into a puzzle, but rarely does its emergent story become more than Well, that went to crap. It doesnt matter while the momentum carries it, but as said, theres a lot of downtime.']",IGN
64,Frozen Cortex,26-Feb-15,Rob Zacny,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/26/frozen-cortex-review,"[""Frozen Cortex is a success on the most important level: developer Mode 7 Games created a smart, turn-based sci-fi sport that blends some of the best parts of American football and rugby. It's tactically demanding, and exciting both to watch and to play. Not only could I believe that this is the bloodsport of choice in some distant future, but I find myself wondering if you could make this game work in real life. Everything that happens on the field is appealing, and it arguably makes even better turn-based tactical game than Mode 7's terrific Frozen Synapse. Its only off the field that it drops a few balls."", 'Cortexs fundamental rules are only a little more complicated than those of Fight Club: the offense is trying to get to the end zone at the south end of the field. Each touchdown is worth seven points. If there is a turnover, play continues with the offense going north. Any player can pass the ball, but the pass has to be in a forward direction. If a player runs with the ball, they must run in a forward direction, and forfeit the chance to pass. It\'s simple stuff that takes just a handful of games to figure out, which is great because the tutorial really only teaches the controls and the manual is wall of text on the ""help"" menu.', ""The simple playing field and a handful of rules generate endless variety as two coaches draw detailed up plans for each of their players during the next turn. You can lay out waypoints for each of your players to navigate, tell them to delay orders in case you need to hit a careful timing, and fill out similar hypothetical plans for your opponent's players based on what you think the other coach might try to do. It's slow-motion competitive mind-reading, full of suspense and agonizing mental gymnastics."", ""Once both players are satisfied with their plans, theyre combined, and both players get to see how their plans end up interacting with each other. Turns end after several seconds or (and this is more likely) when something important happens: a pass is caught, or a turnover takes place. Then both players get a chance to stop and adjust to the new state of play. The pacing is absolutely ideal: turns are just short enough that you don't have to worry about making overly elaborate plans that speculate too far in the future, but they're just long enough to allow for huge, unexpected developments."", ""This also adds another interesting wrinkle: passes are a great offensive weapon that let you bypass a lot of territory at once and keep your options open for your next turn, but it's running plays that can actually be the most surprising and explosive, because they don't cause the turn to end and thus dont give your opponent a chance to give new orders in response. If someone fails to guard a running lane, or if the offensive player arranges a key block, then a good running play will usually result in a score. It's a really cool tradeoff."", 'Randomly generated fields help keep things fresh. Wide-open space is a scarce commodity, as the typical Cortex pitch is carved up into a maze of low barriers, which allow passes but block runs, and high barriers, which deny both passes and runs. One field might promote lots of open field passing and running, while another turns into Space Hulk Rugby as players brawl at tight intersections, all fighting to get final possession of the ball.', 'There are a few dud maps now and then. In one game, each offensive drive started with a wide obstacle between my ""center"" (let\'s call him that, since he started in the center of my formation) and the place where he needed to pick up the ball. The defensive side had clear angles to the ball. So every time my center tried to get the ball, he got there only one step ahead of a tackler, and was tackled on the very next turn, which triggers a turnover. I tried running with the ball and was tackled immediately. I tried throwing it and watched it practically ripped out of my player\'s hands. There was no way, with that map layout and the starting players on both sides, that I would ever be able to take possession of the ball and start a drive. It was a deeply frustrating game. But fortunately, each game is over in 12 turns, so you don\'t have to sit around getting stomped if you have a bad game. More often than not, though, the fate of a game hangs in the balance until the very end.', 'That brings us to the other side of Frozen Cortex: the disappointing sports management game wrapped around the tactical game. When I first laid eyes on a story about corruption in pro Cortex and the tensions in the society that produces it, the Robot Market where you can purchase players with better stats, and the sports book where you can wager on league matches, I was intrigued. Visions of a new Blood Bowl, but with a better and more exciting game at the center of it, danced in my head. But none of that potential ever really materializes.', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'With play limited to a single season, and no management elements other than, ""Gather money, spend on better players,"" the franchise mode proves to be a red herring. It\'s just the normal game with a whole lot of vague narrative cruft and meaningless monopoly money. Likewise, the ""knockout mode"" is basically franchise mode, except that your season ends the first time you lose a game and you can\'t buy players. So the same, but with even less stuff to do. The AI, at least, tends to put up a good fight and gave me something to do while waiting for human players to file their turns.', ""This side of Frozen Cortex is not only much less enjoyable, but it's a collection of huge missed opportunities, made tedious by endlessly talking heads. Fortunately, this is not a major part of playing and enjoying Frozen Cortex, and I expect most people will likely end up ignoring it after a few games. Still, the ingredients of an absolute classic are just sitting there, going to waste alongside an excellent turn-based tactics game."", ""So, it's against human coaches that Frozen Cortex is at its best. It's easy to find an opponent and maintain several games at once, and the tension against a live opponent is positively nerve wracking. To be quite honest, I find it a better game than Mode 7's awesome Frozen Synapse, partly because structuring it as a sport allows for more comebacks and less snowballing victories."", 'It helps that Frozen Synapse just looks and sounds great. While the style is fairly minimalist, as in Frozen Synapse, the quality is far higher across the board. The art  and especially the punchy electronic music  give it a sleek, icy futurist vibe, and the cinematic cam shows robot-on-robot violence to great effect. The only downside is that sometimes important status conditions, such as whether a robot is stunned, can be tough to make out, particularly when a lot of robots end up a in a scrum. Outside of that, Frozen Cortex rather beautifully combines form and function.']",IGN
65,Aaru's Awakening,2-Mar-15,Jon Ryan,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/02/aarus-awakening-review,"['Over the course of my adventure through Aarus Awakening, I encountered boiling lava beasts and crackling mountains made of electric current, defeated gods of both Day and Night. That sounds like good stuff, except that in the process I perished well over 1,500 times, and roughly 700 of those could have been avoided were it not for Aarus often unfair-feeling gameplay and some unwieldy default controls. Despite well-crafted platforming puzzles and vibrantly designed world, I was ready to be finished with Aaru well before Aaru was finished with me.', '\n', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', 'Aarus Awakening is, at the very least, a beautiful game. Developer Lumenox has crafted a colorful world in an interesting hand-drawn style. Each stage is an elaborate fever dream come to life  beasts that live in daylight boil and melt under the heat of the sun, while the creatures of night are shadowy figures contrasted against a starry background. Each frame of gameplay could have been torn from an artists sketchpad, and I thought it a shame that the fast pace at which I was driven forward didnt allow me to stop and admire the work that has clearly been poured into each environment.', 'Instead of stopping to smell the roses (or perhaps more accurately, stare at the monsters), youll find yourself struggling to survive in one of the most challenging 2D platformers since Super Meat Boy. Aaru (the titular half-bear, half-bird warrior) can perform an air-dashing maneuver for some extra leaping distance, as well as charge and shoot a beacon that will instantly teleport him to its location to get him through tight spaces or over the longest gaps. While the teleportation mechanic isnt the most original device in platformers, it provided some genuinely interesting solutions to the many heinously difficult sections  until an errant control issue or collision glitch got in the way.', 'Thats what separates Aarus Awakening from other more successful 2D platformers: its controls are its strangest beast. Gamepad controls are a bit tough to master, since the Charge function is mapped both to its own button and to the directional joystick, which makes it difficult to get around since Aaru constantly dashes in whichever direction hes facing. This was responsible for a large number of deaths that occurred only because instead of leaping to safety, Aaru opted to ram himself headfirst into a wall of spikes. While you can customize your button layout, this can only be done in a pre-launch configuration menu, and even then it only accepts new inputs roughly a third of the time. If youre on keyboard and mouse and have fast reflexes, you should have no problem turning the hulking gorilla-eagle into a world-class acrobat, but a platformer with poor gamepad controls is a bicycle without handlebars.', 'Once I managed to get functional controls, I was quickly impressed by Aarus clever level design and fast-paced scenarios. Even the opening levels were hard enough to get the better of me dozens of times, and it forced my brain to quickly learn how best to use all of Aarus abilities. Each stages obstacles and puzzles are smartly designed to test our skills - and for a while, I relished that. I rejoiced as, fingers aching, I made it to the next checkpoint or finally bypassed a particularly deadly trap.', '\n', 'As I played on, however, this sensation quickly faded as the already vicious difficulty ramped up exponentially, presenting me with scenarios that required equal parts rote memorization and blind luck. Often I would find myself blindly leaping into the next section of the world, unable to see where I was headed; and by the time I reached the final stage, obstacles that cause random teleportations zapped me around so frequently that death screens seemed to pop up any time I nudged Aaru in any direction.', 'Ultimately, this is the biggest downfall of Aarus Awakening. While challenging gameplay is never something I shy away from, in order for me to want to press forward there needs to be something rewarding me for my tireless efforts  which is what Aaru sorely lacks. There are no unlocks, no bonuses, and no extra insight into the unique world. Theres only the occasional narration-over-storyboard cutscene, which takes what could have been an interesting and original take on the cycle of time and presents it with all the pomp and circumstance of an apathetic middle-school book report.', 'Of course, for the hardest-of-hardcore platforming fans theres a time-trial mode and ranking system, but by the time I completed a stage and saw that it had taken me almost an hour, I had no desire to even think about trying to finish it in the minute and a half required for a silver medal. Once Id made it to the next checkpoint I saw no reason to revisit that stage - or to proceed to the next one, save for being able to say I beat this one.']",IGN
66,Dead or Alive 5: Last Round,23-Feb-15,Vince Ingenito,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/23/dead-or-alive-5-last-round-review,"['Dead or Alive 5, in all its incarnations, is the best numbered entry in the long-running fighting game series in terms of raw mechanics, and Dead or Alive 5: Last Round doesnt change that fact. Its still the fast, fluid, accessible brawler it was when I reviewed its original incarnation over two years ago, and the PS4 and Xbox One versions look ever-so-slightly sharper than it did back then. But despite positioning itself as the definitive version of DOA 5, Last Round feels slightly weighed down by some problematic glitches, and uninteresting new characters that make it feel unnecessarily fan-service-focused.', 'First things first: the fighting in Last Round remains as excellent as ever. You can read my full review of Dead or Alive 5 for details on what makes the fighting system so addictive, but in short, DOA takes the rock-paper-scissors idea that lies beneath the hood of most fighting games and bakes it right into your every move and decision. The triangular relationship it creates between throws, holds, and strikes make every moment an opportunity to outthink your opponent. Even before you start wrapping your head around a characters extensive, varied move list, DOA empowers you to recognize your opponents tendencies, and punish them for them. This is the very essence of what makes fighting games great, and like its predecessor, Last Round does it incredibly well.', 'Something else thats set DOA apart over the years, is how distinctive, flashy, and fluid the characters many fighting styles are. Many of them jump off from a traditional martial arts base, and then start taking entertaining left turns with teleportation, elemental attacks, and spinning piledrivers that would make Street Fighters Zangief cry (very manly) tears of jealousy. DOA 5s original cast still walks that line between authenticity and audacity with grace and energy, but the same cant necessarily be said of the characters that have joined the cast since then.', 'Dead or Alive 5 Ultimate introduced some new characters as DLC, and Last Round includes them all, plus two additional challengers, for a total of 34. This gives Last Round the largest playable cast in DOA history, but with rare exception, most of these newcomers and returning series favorites feel bland and forgettable, thanks to a lot of reskinned models and generic move sets. Honoka is probably the worst offender here: shes just a generic-looking schoolgirl with a patchwork move list cobbled together from totally disparate styles across the the rest of the cast. Sure, having more options is great, but if they arent interesting ones, more ends up feeling like less.', 'The more frustrating thing about these characters is that their inclusion feels, on one level or another, more like fan-service rather than good design. Ein and Leon are throwback fan-favorites from older games, but theyve since been effectively replaced by Hayate and Bayman, respectively. Phase 4 is literally a Kasumi clone - the second Kasumi clone (after Alpha 152). Honoka and Marie Rose have completely forgettable fighting styles, but hey, who doesnt love a couple of underage-looking girls to throw into a scandalous outfit or two, right? This is the old DOA mentality, the one I was happy to see banished in the original Dead or Alive 5. Seeing it creep back in is as frustrating as it is disappointing.', ""Not all the characters added since DOA 5 are a bust, though. Momiji and Nyotengu both sport fighting styles interesting enough to make me want to learn them. Nyotengu, like some of the less successful new characters, is a riff on an old DOA character, but one whose highly unorthodox move set has never been reused or repurposed. Momiji's style, while certainly reminiscent of the many ninjas of the cast, adds enough flaming flourishes and impressive acrobatics to set her apart. Watching the two of them face off falls somewhere between late-night Hong Kong wire-fu and a live-action Avatar fan-fic, in the best possible way."", 'Feature-wise, Last Round is as impressive as its predecessor, which featured an excellent training mode and robust online features, like the ability to run online tournaments, kumite, or training sessions. Sadly, as of this writing, not all theses features are working as intended. Depending on which platform youre playing on, you might encounter any number of game-crashing, save-data-corrupting bugs. One particularly troubling issue is the lack of support for MadCatz fight sticks on the Xbox One version, which Team Ninja is looking to fix, along with the many other known issues. Its worth noting that while playing with online throwdowns turned off, I didnt run into these issues on PS4, but seeing as Team Ninja is acknowledging them on its Twitter feed, its safe to say Ive been lucky.']",IGN
67,Evolve,11-Feb-15,Vince Ingenito,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/11/evolve-review,"['Where a lot of high-concept games start with big promises and end in scaled back disappointment, Evolve achieves exactly what it set out to do. Through an array of intelligent design choices, developer Turtle Rock Studios has created a smart, asymmetric, multiplayer monster-hunting game that plays unlike anything else. Its tactically deep, bursting with character, and once you get past its mildly obtrusive progression system, it offers a level of nuance rarely found in multiplayer shooters.', 'A core concept as novel as assuming control of a hulking behemoth and facing off against four player-controlled humanoids could easily have fallen into gimmick territory, if not for the thoughtful way that Hunt, Evolves core mode, is structured. Having the monster start out relatively weak, only to feed and grow in power as the match progresses generates a lot of tension for both sides.', 'The monster needs to move quickly and carefully, balancing the need to put distance between itself and the hunters with the need to find food to level up. Its a high-stakes tightrope act that requires good map knowledge, and a strong grasp of the monsters surprising number of non-combat abilities like climbing, sneaking, and sniffing around. For as effectively as they exude an intimidating physical presence, playing the monster successfully requires patience and skill. Overpowering the hunters is really just your reward for outsmarting them, which makes ripping them to shreds as a max-level monster feel just as satisfying as it looks and sounds.', 'As the hunters, the continually interesting challenge is to find a cunning monster that doesnt want to be found amidst the sprawling and beautifully realized planet of Shear. Fresh tracks and startled birds are among the more obvious clues, but following them like a bread crumb trail is rarely enough. You need to reason out where the monster is headed, and make effective use of your teams amusing sci-fi gadgets. You might tag tempting wildlife with a tracking dart, so that when the monster eats it you can get a bead on its location, or pursue a monster with an unmanned drone to relay his position to your teammates. Since every second that passes without the monster in your crosshairs is another step closer to it becoming nigh-unstoppable, hunts are every bit as thrilling as they are nuanced.', 'Though its hard to take it all in when youre embroiled in an intense monster fight, Evolve looks and sounds remarkably good.  The ground rumbles deeply with Goliaths every step, and Krakens Lightning Strikes light up the screen, sending Hunters tumbling in every which direction while startled wildlife scatter in fear. Each individual element is well executed, but combined as whole during a matchs most pitched moments, the complete picture really is a sight to behold.', 'The true beauty of Evolve, though, is in the subtle details that flesh out its world, its characters, and its mechanics. Characters preen and pose on the title screen, emoting with a cartoonish flare that makes each one memorable. From playful pre-match banter to defiant mid-match monster-taunting, the plentiful voice overs are well written and delivered. Maggie in particular stands out with her fiery intensity and rich cultural history, which gets unpacked in pieces the more I played her  and after more than 20 hours played, Im still catching bits I never heard before.', 'The real genius behind Evolves gameplay is the way each characters abilities synergize, and how each has importance beyond its basic functionality. For instance, Vals tranq gun is primarily used to slow the monsters movement, but since it reveals the monsters position through walls, it allows Cabot to make better use of his structure-penetrating rail cannon. It can be tough to land a hit on a moving target with Hanks Orbital Strike, but once Abe tosses out a Stasis Grenade or two to lock the monster down, you can nail it with no problem. This leads to some rich decision-making at the character select screen, where team composition becomes incredibly important. Evolve is full of tactical possibility, and fortunately, the AI-controlled bots are good enough to test a lot of this stuff out when playing single-player.', 'Annoyingly, some of that possibility sits locked behind a progression system that, while not unreasonable, feels unnecessary. With all 12 hunters, three monsters, and all their perks unlocked, Evolve feels complete and fully fleshed out, but getting there can take anywhere from a few hours to a couple of weeks depending on how good you are and how frequently you play. This makes Evolve seem more limited than it actually is at first, which is a shame because once its all opened up, its anything but.', 'With the default Hunt mode being so central to Evolves identity, itd be easy to forget about the Nest, Rescue, and Defend match types, but Im glad I didnt. Their more straightforward, objective-focused styles make for a nice change up, and they all provide new opportunities to apply your characters skills and gadgets in different ways. Buckets Sentry Turrets and Markovs Arc Mines take on a whole new importance in a mode like defend, and Lazarus ability to bring colonists youre trying to rescue back to life effectively gives the team more time to get to them. Considering that Evolves unique mechanics feel specifically crafted for Hunt, the fact that they work in equally interesting ways in the other modes was a pleasant surprise.']",IGN
68,Kick & Fennick,16-Feb-15,Tom Mc Shea,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/16/kick-fennick-review,"[""You need to be a sure shot in Kick & Fennick, though maybe not in the way you're expecting. You see, the unfortunately named hero Kick sports a rifle with enough oomph to propel his entire body high into the air. Not too shabby. He teams up with a flying robot with a wounded tail named Fennick at the onset, and from there, you use your rocket jump to explore a futuristic cityscape instead of conventional jumping. Kick & Fennick is as unique as it is challenging, continually pushing your skills as you overcome the many obstacles."", ""Things start out slowly as youre given a chance to become accustomed to your gun-powered leaps. You can fire your gun twice before needing to land back on solid ground, where you automatically reload. So you have to figure out how to chain shots together without running out of blasting power while you're still hanging in midair. Fire straight down to gain altitude and then form a 45-degree arc to gracefully soar through a slight hole in a wall. Or aim at an upward angle to shoot through an opening below you while the electrical wires are momentarily turned off. It requires a bit of dexterity to line up a perfect shot, but Kick & Fennick makes things easier by slowing down time while you're fiddling with your aim. And then, once you do fire, the action flies back to real-time speed and you see how well your plan worked."", ""It's not until halfway through the seven-hour adventure that Kick & Fennick hits its stride. The extended tutorials that make up the earliest levels are fun, though rarely demanding, and its a relief when they give way to hard-edged challenges that are as difficult as they are varied. One stretch has you navigating bouncing pads, which may sound benign, but becomes downright devious once you realize you have just two shots to propel yourself across a long series of pads laid over a deadly pit. And when you reach the other side, a wall stands before you comprised entirely of more bouncing pads. This is where your geometry training comes in: can you ricochet from the bottom of the wall to the top? Or are you going to helpless fall back to where you began? It takes a bit of trial and error to climb up there, which makes it satisfying when you do succeed."", 'Those roadblocks tie into a couple of the downsides of Kick & Fennick. Figuring out how to pass a particularly nasty stretch can take 10 or more attempts as you calculate the perfect speed, trajectory, and timing needed, but your limited health often wont allow for such experimentation. Once your life runs out, you must start the level over from the beginning, which can be frustrating considering how tough certain sections can be. Thankfully, there are health orbs scattered about to help stave off death, but theyre in such limited supply that youre destined to run out regardless if youre not a pro. The challenge is welcome, but playing the same sections over again to get back to that challenge is anything but.', ""More troubling, I lost my progress more than a dozen times in the course of my playthrough. When I switched to a different game or just went into the Kick & Fennicks menu, when I came back Id often find myself one level away from where I should have been. I have no idea why, but I wasn't happy."", ""Still, I kept playing because the puzzles are so imaginative. There's a stretch in which your biggest challenge is coming to terms with the series of zip ramps that lie before you. Navigating those levels at high speeds while you line up you next shot brings some much needed excitement that the more methodical levels lacked. And when it throws teleporters in your way, that's when things get even crazier. With these, you not only need to get the right angle entering the portals, but ensure your speed is spot on as well. Successfully leaping through a sequence of portals (often combined with bounce pads and zip ramps) is hugely rewarding because of the skill and determination it takes to reach the other side in one piece."", ""Each of the five chapters culminates in a boss fight that makes use of the aforementioned props in smart ways. Shoving bosses into games built around puzzle solving can often distract from the inherent pleasure of navigating imaginative locales, but in Kick & Fennick, these battles are some of the highlights. Causing a mechanical spider to crash through the floor made me smile with glee, as did fleeing from a robotic monster upon a series of zip ramps. It's a shame there are only five boss encounters during the course of the adventure, because each one provided a nifty change of pace from the core action.""]",IGN
69,Grow Home,6-Feb-15,Brandin Tyrrel,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/06/grow-home-review,"['In a lot of ways, Grow Home is a delight. Its beautiful, original, fluid, and completely charming. Its a game about climbing, platforming, and exploration, but quickly became much more than that the moment I walked my adorably childlike robot character off a floating island and free-fell thousands of feet before swooping in to a safe landing on a leaf glider. Even though I have a personal discomfort with heights, this game made me feel happy as I climbed into its sky.', 'Its charm comes across immediately upon touching down in this gorgeous, vivid, polygonal new world. The flat but colorful look strikes a balance between memories of the Nintendo 64 adventures of yore and the emotive design of Pixar animation. Everything is bright, bold, and bursting with personality.', 'And B.U.D., (Botanical Utility Droid) is a fantastic example of how movement can speak volumes more than words, thanks to the procedurally generated animations that power his arms and legs. Youll push him one way, then change directions mid-stride and watch as he struggles to shift his course against momentum without losing balance, the same way a child might grapple with their own mass and motion.', 'Of course, those animations  like anything generated on the fly  come with their own quirks. The plucky robots feet are in a constant state of motion, and more often than not, unnatural contortion. His many parts will sometimes knot themselves, turning the bipedal B.U.D. into more of a ball of scrap. Its never more than a minor annoyance, and usually occurs in tight spaces and snaps back shortly thereafter, but it does detract from the otherwise smooth, serene nature of Grow Home.', 'That childlike element is reinforced by the onboard counterpart M.O.M., which encourages you whether you reach new heights or shatter on the ground at the end of a lengthy freefall at terminal velocity and rematerialize at the last checkpoint. That maternal vein that runs through Grow Home adds to the sense of serenity. Though gravity and your own miscalculations are your greatest enemy, this world is a safe playground through which to climb and jump and soar and dive.', 'Climbing the giant plant that you must nurture into providing you a way to the heavens uses an unusual but quickly intuitive control setup. Each of B.U.Ds arms is independently controlled with the corresponding mouse buttons or triggers, so climbing becomes a matter of holding onto the terrain with one hand, pushing yourself upward, gripping with the other hand, and repeat. While its certainly reminiscent of games that are intentionally clumsy for comedy purposes (like I Am Bread and Octodad) I didnt feel like Grow Home wanted me to fail at this. Grabbing terrain and objects boils movement down to its most basic elements, and learning to use them was like experiencing the world as a child. Left hand, right hand.', 'Though in the beginning, scrambling up cliffsides might feel like a herculean feat, eventually it becomes second nature, and new elements like flower parachutes, leaf-gliders, and catapults create new ways to float and fall and frolick throughout the world. After a few hours I gathered enough of the scattered power crystals to unlock new powers ranging from a life-saving jetpack to an expanded camera view, allowing for a wider view of your surroundings and the hidden crystals therein, both of which changed the way I played and kept the steady upward climb from becoming too repetitive.', 'While you can finish Grow Home in around three hours, the exploration of discovering each hidden cave and collecting all the crystals can stretch that experience much longer  nearly a dozen hours in my case. However, once youve collected the power crystals and successfully grown your way home, theres little reason to return outside of achievement chasing.

70,Homeworld Remastered Collection,24-Feb-15,Dan Stapleton,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/24/homeworld-remastered-collection-review,"['If Id never seen or heard of Homeworld or Homeworld 2 before playing The Homeworld Remastered Collection, and you told me they first came out in 1999 and 2003, Id probably have called you a liar. Even ignoring Remastered Collections beautifully enhanced graphics, which wouldve definitely fooled me into believing these were modern real-time strategy games, the way original developer Relic expertly pulls off a brilliant recreation of the Star Wars-scale space fleet battles is nothing short of amazing. Time has been very kind to both Homeworlds highly atmospheric story, and its design. Its fantastic that new developer Gearbox has updated these games for a new generation of strategy fans.', 'But of course I did play Homeworld in 1999, and a great many games since, yet these two 15-hour campaigns are still some of the best large-scale space battles Ive ever taken part in. The way fighters strafe and weave in combat is really impressive  they almost never have physics-breaking bumper-car collisions  and I adore watching individual turrets on larger ships track their targets. That breathtaking attention to detail, along with the newly refreshed models, textures, and effects highlight the creatively distinctive and often asymmetrical spaceship designs. A good-sized engagement of a few dozen ships is like a ballet mixed with a fireworks display of violent explosions, lighting up the already colorful nebula-tinged skyboxes like a laser show.', 'Homeworld and Homeworld 2 definitely arent simple games, but their complexity is the rewarding kind. Controlling fleets that can move freely in full-3D space is challenging to get the hang of, and it can be difficult to even figure out whats going on when two armadas of fighters, bombers, and corvettes are all swirling around in a giant furball of a dogfight around frigates, destroyers, battlecruisers, carriers, and the massive mothership itself. Getting used to tethering the free-floating camera to ships or objects in the area youre interested in is the equivalent of finding your sea legs when youre accustomed to having solid ground under your feet.', 'Homeworlds interface does a good job of helping you wrangle your forces, though, especially now that many of Homeworld 2s improvements have been retrofitted to the original. Zooming out to a tactical view of the area and giving orders to control groups makes things manageable, and double-clicking to select every unit of a type lets you take command of fast-moving and scattered ships. The toughest trick is giving orders to travel to a specific point in space - you have to give a move order, then hold Shift to adjust the altitude, and you have to constantly shift the camera around to get a sense of depth. Admirably, the interface does all of this without getting in the way of the action - even the build and research menus are mostly kept collapsed and out of sight. Subtle improvements, like the elimination of the need to refuel fighters and corvettes periodically, makes moment-to-moment gameplay move a little smoother than it originally did.', '', '', '', '', 'Actually, the full-3D navigation is rarely used in missions, as most of the action takes place on a 2D plane. I find the ability to send your ships up and down the Z-axis is more essential to Homeworlds imposing sense of scale than its mission design or fleet tactics  the vastness of space becomes clear when you realize these maps are as large vertically as they are horizontally. A side effect of the huge maps is that theres quite a bit of downtime, and a slow pace in general as huge, plodding starships make their way from one side to the other. That deliberate movement has the advantage of keeping things from becoming overwhelming during the heat of battle; even though Im managing dozens of ships at once, I rarely worry Ill miss something crucial. Waiting for resource harvesters to drain asteroids of their mineral treasures is quite tedious at times, though.', 'A rock-paper-scissors balancing system makes it fairly easy to determine what ships you should send to counter the enemy, though you usually have options. You could stop an incoming wave of enemy interceptors with interceptors of your own, or multi-gun corvettes, or activate a Gravity Well Generator to disable them completely so that your Assault Frigates can pick them off. The big-picture strategy is to make sure you have ships in range to respond to new threats before its too late, which leads to some tense juggling and risk-taking.\n', 'There are some great missions in the first 15-hour campaign: challenges like fending off swarms of drone ships in a dense nebula, reacting to surprise attacks, defending allies, and capturing enemies keep the goals varied. The stakes of battle are raised considerably by the fact that your fleet is persistent from mission to mission, meaning that if you lose a destroyer in battle, you might have a tougher time getting through the next mission. Its generally good at scaling the threat to match what youve brought with you, though you might have to load a previous missions auto-save to get back to that tough spot with more firepower and resources in the bank. A few missions dont hold up  clearing a wave of asteroids headed for your stationary mothership is a tedious exercise after blasting the first couple of rocks. Another mission forces you to guide your ships through a dust cloud to shield them from radiation; in the original, the dust particles were easy to spot; in Remastered, theyre one-pixel dots and frustratingly difficult to follow.', 'Those are more than worth tolerating, because Homeworld tells a fantastic, emotional story  something very few real-time strategy games have done. With nothing but spaceship models, artful use of the cinematic camera, awe-inspiring classical music, and some excellent parallax animations and voiceovers, Relic created a convincing tale of a people fleeing genocide and setting out in a desperate search of their ancestral home. This game has gravitas.\n', 'Transitioning from Homeworld to Homeworld 2 is an interesting mix of tradeoffs. Like in the first two seasons of Battlestar Galactica, Homeworlds story is an emotional story of desperate survival, and as powerful today as it was 15 years ago. Like the third and fourth seasons of Battlestar Galactica, Homeworld 2 loses sight of what made it special and turns to less relatable themes like playing out mystic prophecy and cliches of reuniting ancient artifacts. To be fair, Homeworld is a tough act to follow, but its still a bit of a let down in that department.', 'On the other hand, mission design is significantly improved in the similarly lengthy sequel, with no memorably annoying scenarios and plenty of great battles, some of which feature outrageously powerful ships. Homeworld 2 notably makes a big jump forward in control by shifting from Homeworlds individually built small ships to treating whole squadrons as a single unit, which removed much of the busywork from maintaining a large, spectacular fleet. Its too bad that story mojo runs out in the second game, because Relic learned so much from the first campaign in regards to mission design and pacing that Homeworld 2 is significantly more fun to play.', 'Notably absent is Homeworld: Cataclysm, the campaign that came between the two numbered games. Gearbox says too much of the source materials from that game has been lost or misplaced to give it the full remastering treatment for now.', 'Its a shame Gearbox couldnt take the Beta label off of the multiplayer modes before The Remastered Collection went on sale, so it should be approached with skepticism with regards to its balance and stability. However, its great that the it offers the ability to play as any of the four different factions from across both games. This means you can set up a scenario where you play as the Kushan from the original Homeworld against Homeworld 2s Hiigarans (the same people), or match the first games Taiidan empire against the second games invading Vaygr. Not that any of the sides is radically different in a mechanical sense, but the subtleties of each, such as the Kushans Stealth Fighter and Drone Frigate, give the options some variety. Its here that the research system that seems so superfluous in the single-player game (because techs are unlocked one or two at a time) actually matters, and allows for some crucial decisions for what type of fleet youll build. Homeworld will likely never be a competitive RTS due to its slow pace, but skirmishing against the AI or other space battle fans wont get old anytime soon. It also features a great fleet painter, which lets you splash your ships with pink and purple if you so chose.', 'On the technical side, Ive experienced great performance on my GeForce GTX 970, and only one crash in more than 40 hours of play. The one significant issue has been that running in full screen mode has caused a strange problem where the cursor is constrained to roughly 75 percent of the screen area, unable to reach the bottom or right sides. (Windowed mode works fine.) For some reason, this occurred on two of three computers tested, and Gearboxs team says this is the first theyve heard of it.', 'Much as I appreciate the inclusion of the original, untouched versions of Homeworld and Homeworld 2 as extras in The Remastered Collection, some slight updating wouldve been nice - for example, making them support 16:9 resolutions without having to go in and tweak .ini files. But they do run, if only barely. Trying to run Homeworld Classic at above 640x480 caused text to become illegible. But this is the only way to experience fun but goofy features ability to play through the Homeworld campaign as the Taiidan instead of the Kushan.']",IGN
71,Total War: Attila,12-Feb-15,TJ Hafer,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/12/total-war-attila-review,"['In the sixth year of my nomadic campaign as the Visigoths, I realized Total War: Attila had turned me from a conqueror into a starved wolf in the wilderness. That sensation of desperate hunger for a land to call home is game-changing for the Total War series, and makes Attilas campaign feel like much more than a glorified expansion pack for its predecessor, Rome 2. In fact, Attila is proudly its own game, and puts a firm foot forward in contrast to Rome 2s initially unsatisfying jumble. Its biggest faults come across largely as missed opportunities in an overstretched empire, rather than ill-conceived banes to my ability to enjoy myself.', 'The dynamic, driving forces of the campaign are the strongest rallying points for recommending this iteration of Total War. From the East comes the onslaught of the Huns; from the North come increasingly harsh winters that will eventually make large portions of the map almost uninhabitable. My Visigoths - one of 10 playable factions - were flung into the resulting barbarian pinball machine, bombarding the weakened Roman Empire while battling other tribes for the steadily vanishing fertile land. Where most Total War games see your empire expand ever outward, Attila instead forces you to keep a foothold on a shrinking island of safety and prosperity.', 'Having no home province to defend at all costs, and being beset by unstoppable elemental forces changed the way I thought about waging war, and created dire situations that forced me into a ruthless, survivalist mindset. When a blizzard caught my nomadic band in the Alps and killed a third of my men, I knew I needed to find food and shelter, now. It didnt matter how much blood I had to spill, nor whose blood it was. For a moment, I felt like I understood the perspective of these ancient people, notorious for raiding and pillaging. This was a matter of becoming savage or becoming dead, the finer points of morality be damned. Its a fresh feeling in a genre that usually revolves around the question of Who should I conquer next? The map itself had the initiative, and I knew I would rise or fall based on my ability to react.', 'My efforts were easier to manage than in Rome 2, because the campaign interface in Attila is an across-the-board improvement. Instead of trying to cram things into the bar at the bottom of the screen, Creative Assembly has realized that its okay to hide the map sometimes, giving us bigger info panels like the easy-to-understand family tree diagram. When a Roman spy (who had taken issue with my burning of the whole of Northern Italy) assassinated my heir, Theoderic, I actually had a firm idea of who Theoderic was. For an ultimately replaceable general lacking in context, I might have let the slight slide. For the young man who was supposed to carry on my legacy, I would settle for nothing less than unleashing a dozen flavors of hell on the perpetrators.', 'Internal politics and diplomacy are still pretty impenetrable, though. Control over your faction is a sliding scale from Insignificant to Absolute, with both extremes putting you at a high risk for civil war. The system does its job in that you can always see internal turmoil looming, but attempting to steer away from it remains a huge chore. When my family grew so influential they threatened my stability, it was easy enough to grant offices or important commands to members of other sub-factions and restore the balance. But when my badass warlord died, taking most of my political clout with him, I was left with very few tools to stabilize the situation. Bizarrely, actions like political assassination can only be carried out against members of your own family. So that jerk who wanted to overthrow my young, newly-crowned High King was hard to get rid of, which made sending him off to charge headlong into an unwinnable battle seem like a good idea instead of a terrible one. This method really feels like an exploit, which is never a good thing to be forced to rely on.', 'Diplomacy is just as frustrating. If I have Iron and Fur resources in excess, and the nearly destitute tribe in the next province has a Friendly opinion of me, it makes no gods-damned sense that they would repeatedly refuse a trade agreement which benefits us both and costs them nothing. Even when I offered upwards of two seasons harvest in gold as a signing bonus, they still turned their noses up at me. The worst part about this is that the negotiation screen gives you no indication of why the AI deems a deal unacceptable (unless they propose a counter-offer, which they usually dont). This is a long-standing issue in the Total War series. I may have let it slide in 2006, but with every passing game it becomes a less excusable weakness.', 'Of course, the real-time battlefield is still definitely Total Wars main focus, and its been enhanced in a lot of small ways for Attila. The pacing is much improved, thanks to units taking longer to rout, and often regrouping afterwards rather than fleeing the field after one setback. New raider-type units are able to capture gates, towers, and control points faster. They also set fire to structures, which encourages defenders to waver from their lines to prevent persistent damage to buildings that carries over to the campaign map. This adds an extra layer to the choice of army composition for the wandering hordes that Attila places in the spotlight.', 'Outside that spotlight, there are some discouragingly rough edges. Most notably, the so far non-playable Celtic factions in Britain use Nordic or Roman units, disappointingly lacking their own roster or models. Id bet my bottom denarius this will eventually be rectified with DLC, but one of the eras major culture groups shouldve been adequately represented up front.', '\n', 'On the bright side, I encountered no game-stopping bugs or crashes in two full campaign playthroughs. I still caught the AI doing nonsensical things like refusing to seek cover from direct missile fire or scooting its ladders around my walls for 10 minutes looking for just the right spot. But, especially in siege battles, theyre generally far more competent than in past Total Wars. Weird decisions seemed like quirks of the AI, not outright broken code.']",IGN
72,The Order: 1886,19-Feb-15,Brandin Tyrrel,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/19/the-order-1886-review,"[""Though absolutely gorgeous and wonderfully atmospheric, The Order: 1886 is a deeply conflicted thing. Even more than its secret battle against the monsters of legend, The Orders greatest struggle is ultimately its own internal tug-of-war between telling a beautifully presented story and granting the level of interactivity we've come to expect from a game. In the end, a lopsided commitment to perfecting style and plot comes at the cost of sluggish pacing, a look-but-don't-touch world, and paint-by-numbers gunplay."", 'On the surface, that approach pays off. The Order is thick with exquisitely detailed environments that showcase the grand opulence of London built atop poverty-stricken slums. Its populated by characters that are generally well-developed, motivated, and believable. And theres a concerted effort to extend that fantastic polish into a seamless experience, merging gameplay with its many lengthy cutscenes as it delivers a generally good historical-fantasy story.', 'In seven hours in developer Ready At Dawns alternate version of London, I rubbed elbows with historical figures like legendary inventor Nikola Tesla, who serves as the The Orders gadget guy. His involvement allows for fantastic Victorian super-weapons that never were: the Arc Gun, the Thermite Rifle, and the bazooka-like Shoulder Cannon. I investigated the dealings of the famed East India Company, and heard stories of a new serial killer called Jack the Ripper. And I did all this as the strong and reserved Sir Galahad, a member of The Order  the Victorian-era incarnation of the Knights of the Round Table. By pulling these threads from history and myth, The Order: 1886 weaves an engaging and convincing patchwork of historical fiction that I want to spend time in. But I was genuinely surprised when the story abruptly ended  leaving multiple characters and secondary arcs dangling in the wind in an obvious sequel setup. It left me wanting to know whats next for this world.', 'However, maintaining its scripted, linear storytelling means that when The Order must relinquish control outside of combat, it does so only enough to allow for the most basic of interactions with its world. Between lengthy cutscenes, there are long periods of restrained movement where youre meant to simply walk, taking in the sights and listening to character dialog. Its an issue thats somewhat mitigated by the fact The Order: 1886 is just so damn polished, so there is plenty to keep the eye occupied, but this too suffers from diminishing returns as the super-scripted segments strip you of any freedom. Constantly being ripped from gameplay to cutscene to restrained walking segment back to cutscene is a pervasive whiplash of false starts.', 'Even when youre specifically instructed to touch something, theres rarely a moment of interactivity that isnt expressed with a quick-time event. Theyre at their best when youre trading slashes with hulking monsters  where slow reactions or imprecision will find you watching Galahads throat ripped out in some impressive horror-movie gore. But these moments are the exception, rather than the rule, and most of it is simply pushing carts, pulling ropes, turning levers, or flipping over carts to climb ledges or continue down the set path.', 'When a quick-time event wont do, were pushed into disappointingly generic cover-based shooting and stealth segments against equally generic, human enemies. And though these sequences are certainly interactive, The Order: 1886 does little to elevate them beyond their most basic elements. The encounters in which you actually fight the monsters that are billed as such a large part of the game are dwarfed by those in which youre simply whack-a-mole shooting goons. I lost count of the times I traded small-arms fire with waves of hapless guards and fodder until an ally says Thats all of them, and it was time to move on.', 'Cover shooting falls into the old comfort zone where lining up the camera and popping out to kill an enemy becomes a rinse-and-repeat cycle of near invulnerability thanks to your vial of Blackwater  The Orders secret serum you can drink (via a quick-time event) to revive yourself from the verge of death. While the weapons look great and pack some creative punch, its unfortunate were not given a lot of interesting tactical situations to shoot our way out of.', ""Though its not especially challenging, the whole process of shooting is made more annoying by the ever-present black bars at the top and bottom of the screen. They're intended to create a letterboxed, cinematic look. But when I was behind cover, I was much more interested in being able to see what was happening in my limited vertical screen space than having a wider aspect ratio. That frustration led me to avoid crouching behind cover as much as possible, which in turn led to the majority of my deaths occurring when I left cover looking for insta-kill, quick-time melee takedowns."", 'Rare fights against werewolves are absolutely the best parts of The Orders action, mostly because their hit-and-run attacks are fast and less predictable than trading shots with the cookie-cutter guard, shotgunner, or sniper. Unfortunately, the knights of The Order are part-time monster hunters at best.']",IGN
73,Midnight Star,13-Feb-15,Mikel Reparaz,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/13/midnight-star-review,"[""Midnight Star seems to really want to be Halo. It's a desire that comes through in its environments, with their gleaming sci-fi structures set against rolling green hills; in its aliens, with their brightly colored armor and guttural muttering; and in its sweeping backstory, which feels under-explained without the free companion graphic novel. Unfortunately, while Midnight Star hits all the right aesthetic notes  hardly surprising, as its development studio was co-founded by one of Halo's creators  its gameplay falls short, and all that stuff becomes window dressing for a mildly enjoyable, ploddingly repetitive, free-to-play shooting gallery."", ""To be fair, Midnight Star does a decent job addressing one of the key failings of first-person shooters on mobile devices: the awkwardness of moving and aiming with a touchscreen. Movement is handled automatically, with Lt. Charlie Campbell trudging through nicely rendered alien scenery between bouts of blasting apart enemies. You're therefore free to focus on aiming  and, as the enemy indicators to your sides light up, turning to deal with the threats that continually try to outflank you."", 'They don\'t try very hard, though. At the default ""normal"" difficulty, your enemies seem more interested in stepping out of cover and staring at you than in actually shooting, and their slow-moving bullets apparently take a while to charge up, giving you plenty of time to shoot their huge, round faces before they become a threat. At higher difficulties, the shots get considerably more frequent and your enemies much tougher, although they still seem more eager to run around and hide than to actually fire back.', ""Your own tactics, meanwhile, are to stand out in the open and tap to shoot enemies as quickly as possible with a variety of unlockable firearms (although the starting assault rifle, which can be repeatedly upgraded, worked just fine through all 14 available missions). Instead of cover, you have a limited force field  activated by pressing two fingers to the screen  that can block incoming projectiles, forcing you to think fast while picking off targets. You can also zoom in on specific enemies for bonus headshot damage, and turning to face new threats is as simple as tapping the enemy indicators to the right and left, which change from yellow to red if someone's readying a shot from off screen."", ""At its best, Midnight Star becomes a constant stream of firing, zooming in, reloading, and throwing up your shields, punctuated by occasional breaks in the action when an alien runs up close for a slow-motion melee quick-time event. Thanks to the distinctive audio and visual cues, instantly switching actions and responding to different battle situations quickly becomes second nature, and the fun comes more from moving fast enough to keep up an unbroken kill spree (while the booming announcer counts off each slaying) than it does from the simple thrill of hammering enemies with bullets. It nevertheless gets repetitive fast, though, and thanks to the small handful of enemy types and behaviors, Midnight Star's charms are short-lived and better enjoyed in short bursts."", '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', ""Maybe that's just as well. Staying competitive in Midnight Star means upgrading your equipment and the research facilities at your headquarters between missions, and this takes time  so naturally, it's where the freemium aspects come into play. It's not as bad as it sounds, though; new weapons and upgrades are paid for with Tech Points awarded generously through play, while the premium currency, Catalyst, is used to hurry things along (or stand in for TP when you don't have enough). Between missions, Midnight Star gets a little pushy about reminding you to use and buy Catalyst, but it's not necessary for advancement, and those who don't mind waiting for improvements can keep playing  or go do something else  while the upgrade timer counts down."", ""Then there's the story, which involves time manipulation and a disaster that leaves Charlie and his three crewmates as the apparent last survivors of humanity, and which unfolds in conversations between static character portraits. It's not the most compelling way to deliver plot, but it works well enough, except for moments when the characters offhandedly reference events and concepts that aren't explained in-game. The free iOS graphic novel Midnight Rises fills in some of the gaps (and helps define the main character beyond his smarmy voice-overs), but having to read a separate piece of media to understand the story is a drag  and even with its help, the story feels somewhat confusing.""]",IGN

I was enjoying the simplicity of attacking iconic characters from the Witcher world with flashy spells, and didnt notice that the clock had stopped ticking and the respawn count had locked in place. Battle Arena has broken, and the match will not count. I reboot the iPad app, load up another match, and run into new, equally irritating bugs and disruptive connectivity issues. This is common, unfortunately, and unacceptable for a free-to-play 3v3 MOBA that already has substantial problems.', 'The rich world of The Witcher is primed and ready for competitive multiplayer game, and Battle Arena gives each of its nine launch characters a fun and distinct set of skills. Letho is a brutish tank who can deal and receive damage in bulk at the expense of mobility; Iorveths archery expertise leaves him vulnerable if anyone closes the gap, but utterly devastating from afar if you can land his skill-shots; and Geralt of Rivia himself modifies his stylish attacks with the Sign magic that makes him such a talented monster hunter in the mainline Witcher games. These characters and more rotate in and out of free-to-play accessibility, so if you play long enough you can enjoy everyone without spending a dime.', 'Characters abilities feel appropriate, and their skills are satisfying to execute in sequence, but, unlike other attempts at adapting MOBA gameplay to mobile platforms, the lack of player-to-player communication completely neuters Battle Arena. It positions itself as an objective-based tactical game, but matches typically boil down to mundane deathmatches with minimal strategic options.', 'Both arenas available at launch feature layouts too similar to one another to stand out as remarkable, and with no meaningful way to coordinate with your teammates, its tough to claim and defend their three objective points. Pressing the red exclamation-mark icon pings your teammates with unhelpful information, indicating allies with a green shield, enemies with red swords, and control points with blue flags. If you can see the label, you can see the objective; the ping contributes nothing, and theres no reason to ever use it.', 'To make multiplayer matters worse, theres no way to play with friends -- no friends list, no useful Game Center connectivity, no way to invite specific players, and no local-play features at all. It also fails to punish players who quit mid-match, so theres little reason to stay in a game thats going poorly. In a multiplayer strategy game where its important to stun, slow, and deal damage in the right order, its embarrassing that The Witcher Battle Arena does nothing to facilitate team-based multiplayer or discourage quitting. And if youre not queuing into a 3v3 game with randoms, youre stuck practicing against bots alone or with an unknown couple of online allies.', 'Battle Arenas disappointing technical issues exacerbate this. I had three bugged matches that wouldnt end, meaning I wouldnt earn currency to purchase new characters or skins, and I wouldnt unlock stat-boosting items for my heroes. I disconnected from matches at least once every time I loaded it up, too. In a game where the economy relies entirely on plentiful play time to improve your hero with RPG upgrades, this is unforgivable.', 'Worse, The Witcher Battle Arena erased my progress entirely after six hours of play  my leveled-up characters lost their loot, and any character or skin I unlocked vanished. It hurt to lose this because the unlock system is rewarding like a great RPG  items feel valuable, particularly when receiving rarer loot drops for boots, belts, and other improvements.

His scenes are almost pure banter with his sidekick, Beskha, and quick-time event action, so hes given no decisions tougher than whether or not to kill a couple of people who just tried to kill him. Hes likable enough, but hopefully theres more to him than this.', 'Meanwhile, a surprising new playable character arrives at Ironrath to pick up the story, and we get to see the Forrester family cope with their losses in some well-written scenes of grief and anger. There was some disappointment when I saw how little my choice of who to appoint as Ethans chief advisor actually mattered, though.', 'Gared Tuttles introduction to life in the Nights Watch closely retreads Jon Snows story. Sure, its important to establish which of his two fellow recruits will be a friend and which will be an enemy, but its an obligatory and mostly dull episode for him. Quick-time event combat training and simple archery target practice dont make this a better game. Even an appearance by Jon Snow himself does little to pick up the pace.', 'Mira Forrester remains the highlight of this series. She doesnt match the tension of the first episodes throneroom encounter with Cersei Lannister, but the choice of whether to betray Margaery Tyrells trust was the toughest one in Lost Lords. Its notable that unlike most decisions in Telltales games, theres no timer - I sat there and agonized over the pros and cons for a minute or two before making my decision.

Developer Petroglyphs outside-the-box faction design left me with an odd aftertaste regarding balance in potential competitive play, but it definitely hit the spot.', 'The action takes place in the far future, where technologically advanced humans and a scrappy but noble alien race called the Beta face off against the Gooself-replicating nanobots that seek to consume everything in their path. Allegiances change and new threats are revealed as events unfold, but there are no story-affecting choices to be made, and bonus objectives in each mission dont carry over into any kind of advantage in future missions.

Suffice it to say there are few surprises, but whats here is well done.', 'This conflict plays out across 15 campaign missions  five for each faction  and is presented with a generous helping of impressive cutscenes. Its a lot of standing and talking in command rooms, with just a splash of glorious explosions, but the surprisingly good facial animations and voice acting serve to add meaningful context to the story. The selfless leader of the Beta, Saruk and the human-allied AI, Singleton, are notably complex and likable cornerstones of the cast  even if their arcs do closely mirror elements of StarCraft.', 'While the density of the story keeps events moving at a nice clip, the fact that you only get five missions with each faction makes each segment feel a bit too much like an extended tutorial. By the time youve been introduced to all of your toys as the Beta, its already time to put them away and start the Human missions. Not until multiplayer will you really be able to explore the more complex strategies and synergies available within each army  which is a missed opportunity, because there are some extremely novel dynamics to play with.', 'The action on the battlefield is a familiar song and dance to the RTS faithful, but the design of the Humans, Beta, and Goo is impressively asymmetrical. The standout is the Goo, a completely mobile swarm with no need for a permanent base. A Mother Goo can suck up resources from the map  or enemies she comes in contact with  and then move on to convert the material into units, meaning the Goos economy is a moving target.

Mother Goos can be used offensively as well, sneaking across otherwise inaccessible cliff faces and right onto your doorstep, where they can spit out units and start digesting your base as a melee-range siege weapon. My greatest victories as the Goo relied on my ability to use them in defiance of common RTS logic to catch opponents off guard, which can be a lot of fun.', 'However, their power is kept in check by the attention required to micromanage multiple mobile, vulnerable Mothers while also trying to conduct battle on several fronts. That actually puts the Goo at a distinct, logistical disadvantage in the late game, when you can have 10 Mothers to deal with. This is a major finesse-style faction that only the best multitaskers will be able to handle effectively  if Zerg larva management gives you headaches, youre going to need to get something prescription-strength for Goo play.', 'Your opponent will be equally frustrated in a match against the Goo that runs the clock up, but for different reasons. A Goo player who has lost a decisive battle can easily turn the next 20 minutes into a frustrating hunt for the last few remaining mothers slinking around the map. Imagine if floating Terran buildings in StarCraft II could continue to collect resources and produce units while mobile, and didnt require a command center to remain hidden, and you might get some sense of the problem.', 'The ambitious faction design creates concerns with the Humans, too. All of their structures must be connected with a network of low-hitpoint power conduits, which forces some interesting base layout planning. The downside is that all your eggs are locked into that basket, and almost every map includes ramps and other obstacles that keep you restricted to a small region. That means the late game involves a lot of long-distance resource mining, forcing you to protect harvesters coming and going from far afield. The ability to teleport structures and turrets anywhere on the network is handy, but if the network is broken, everything loses power. It makes human bases extremely vulnerable, and recovery from losing a major battle on your own turf near impossible.', 'The Beta, meanwhile, can build anywhere on the map, have arguably the best defensive structures, and dont need to worry about conduit power. They even have the best of the three game-ending super-units, the Hand of Ruk, which acts as a mobile factory and mounts smaller units aboard to add firepower to its already massive area-of-effect cannon. Its possible that the Beta feel so much more potent because they behave the most like a traditional RTS army, and thus their best strategies came to me more quickly and naturally than those for the other factions. Nonetheless, Id expect the early days of Grey Goo multiplayer to be dominated by these guys, until the hardcore RTS community works out viable strategies to take them down.', 'Outside of that, the only major flaws in Grey Goos polish were occasional crashes to desktop, and a couple total lock-ups on specific campaign missions, which seemed to be brought on by a sensitivity to alt-tabbing.']",IGN
77,Apotheon,4-Feb-15,Meghan Sullivan,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/04/apotheon-review,"['Apotheons thin but reverential ancient Greek setting sits atop a homage to classic action-adventure side-scrollers like The Battle of Olympus and The Legend of Zelda II: The Adventure of Link. The good news is Apotheon successfully captures both the artstyle of Ancient Greece and the feel of its ancient predecessors by featuring clever level designs filled with allies and enemies that evoke images of powerful Greek gods and heroes. The bad news is slightly clumsy controls and a flimsy story prevent Apotheon from reaching Olympian heights.', ""Man vs. Olympian is an ancient plot, and nothing new to games. God of War, Kid Icarus, The Battle of Olympus, and even Altered Beast all tackle the subject with varying degrees of success. But while God of War has a complex story revolving around a complex hero, Apotheon does very little to establish its protagonist as a person. All I know about the heroic Nikandreos is that he must travel to Olympus and defeat gods who no longer have a use for humanity. True, the 80s sidescrollers Apotheon emulates had almost no story whatsoever, but I was disappointed developer Alien Trap didn't create a deeper tale to match its art."", 'I did learn quite a few things about ancient Greece during my 15-hour adventure, however. There are numerous stone steles sprinkled throughout the immortal realm of Olympus, with enjoyable quotes from ancient writers explaining the character and purpose of each Olympian. Hera has reared a violent son whom she has borne to Zeus: Ares, a god irascible, hard to govern, one whose mind knew no respect, warns Aeschylus on a stele outside the war gods domain. Clever level designs meanwhile feature environments and enemies that reflect each gods power, such as Ares blood-soaked arena full of crazed hoplite warriors, and Athenas palace, where a revolving platform maze full of puzzles and deadly mechanical devices require as much mental effort as physical; fitting for the goddess of war and wisdom. Each gods domain can be visited in almost any order too, which gives the world a refreshingly quasi-open feel.', 'I also dug how weapons and armor have accurate names, and behave as expected: I used long-shafted spears called doru (historically used in phalanx battles) to keep enemies at a distance, but when they got in close I had to either quickly switch to my xiphos (a short sword), defend myself with a shield, or roll out of the way. And if that didnt work, I could try luring enemies into a well-placed trap.', ""Having to use different weapons and strategies on the fly added a nice sense of realism to battle, though using the quick-toggle feature to navigate my inventory columns wasnt as smooth. More than once I got killed because I couldn't cycle through weapons quickly enough to equip what I needed when I needed it (as opposed to one-button equipping), which was difficult to do when enemies were dogpiling me. (I could pause combat and access my inventory from the main menu, but that slowed the flow of gameplay.) And although I had a type of auto-aim for launching missiles at enemies, manually trying to line up a shot (as is required by certain puzzles) was an exercise in patience due to a fussy aiming mechanic: I wasted about 20 arrows trying to hit a device that would open a door in Athenas maze."", 'Neither of those issues was nearly as annoying as the sticky platform controls, though. Many fights against the Olympians required being able to quickly leap from platform to platform to avoid attacks, a tricky thing to do with a hero that sticks to corners like gum. There were also times when Nikandreos refused to land on a platform that it looked like he should be able to reach, as if his trajectory was always just slightly off, which resulted in some nasty falls that drained my health. These issues didnt bother me much in the beginning, but as levels became more platform intensive and battles more fierce, my feelings or frustration began to grow. I cursed Apotheon out after repeatedly getting hit by lightning bolts because Nikandreos refused to jump onto a column, then clung to the corner of a statue just a second too long, giving the enemy time to attack.', 'While I have mixed feelings about the platforming and inventory management, I have no doubts about Apotheons stunning look and feel. Im smitten by the art style, which pays homage to Greek amphora found in museums throughout the world. Vibrant coral reds and creamy yellows evoke the colorful glazes used to decorate ancient pottery, and real statues and murals are lovingly recreated. (The Statue of Zeus at Olympia is one example). And I love the pinwheel joints and enigmatic expressions of  the characters, which are so emblematic of the Archaic style. The music is just as authentic; the soothing sounds of a plucked lyre while hunting in a sacred forest, and heavy drums booming as I sparred with guards who caught me pilfering jars in the public market creates a great atmosphere.', 'Apotheon includes local two-player competitive mode, which allowed me and a friend to take up arms against each other.  The result was a brief run of amusing moments, like when my partner accidentally set himself on fire after throwing a boulder into an oil lamp, or when I comically flew backwards after being skewed by javelin. However, after a few rounds our heroic duels became repetitive.', '\n']",IGN
78,Gravity Ghost,5-Feb-15,Daniel Krupa,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/05/gravity-ghost-review,"['Gravity Ghost is one of the oddest and most relaxing space adventures Ive ever embarked upon. While its view of the cosmos is grounded in science  you learn plenty about slingshot trajectories and astro-geometry  its really brought to life by a vibrant sense of spirituality. Physics and mysticism combine in an experience thats both funny and sad, eccentric and poignant, soothing and frequently baffling. Even though the challenge remains slight throughout and it never really makes the most of its most promising mechanics, I found Gravity Ghost a delightful curiosity throughout.', '\n\n', '', 'Before heading through the space gate, where things get surreal very quickly, a little context is useful. You play as a young girl who has died in an unspecified incident and been reincarnated among the stars. The visuals have a charming roughness to them  you can see individual, textured brushstrokes  and when combined with the simple, cartoon character design and its joyful use of colour, it feels like playing a game illustrated by a child. Is this the dead girl coming to terms with what has happened to her? I think thats the intention, and I found it strangely moving. Yes, Gravity Ghost initially seems a bit silly, but crucially its never flippant; it never loses sight of its underlying narrative about how this girl died.', 'Her moving story is pieced together by journeying from planet to planet, solving simple but novel physics-based puzzles, and illuminating constellations. No matter where you are in the cosmos the challenge is always the same: you must collect a tiny star  located somewhere in the level, usually orbiting another planet  to unlock a door which leads to the next system. This is complicated by the intrusion of gravity, which makes leaping from planetoid to planetoid manageable, but less than straightforward.', 'Just like in Mario Galaxy, when youre close to a sizeable chunk of mass, youre drawn towards it and can land on its surface. But thats where the similarities end, as Gravity Ghost expects you to take more daring leaps into the black stuff. It\'s much less daunting than it sounds because of the lack of a ""death"" situation, and I felt encouraged to experiment with the invisible forces, determined by the layout of orbiting bodies in a given level, push and pull you around the screen. Youre not entirely at the mercy of gravity, however; you can resist and sometimes even break away from the gravity of a nearby planet, and drift freely in space until snared by another rock.', 'But even as I solved puzzle after puzzle, I never felt like I truly understood how best to exploit this invisible force and turn it to my advantage. Collecting space debris makes the girls hair grow  which I assume is supposed to function as some kind of aid, giving form to the invisible forces at work  and while it was useful to see the trajectory I had been on, I found it next to useless when plotting my next course.', 'Special abilities are soon introduced to give you more control while drifting through space, and they do make getting around a bit easier. By the end, youre able to hover briefly in the air, adopt a super-dense form, and dash left or right  all of which allow you to deviate from a set orbit. The pacing of these abilities is well-judged, too, with each one being introduced once Id was comfortable with the last. Yet no matter how many abilities I gained, I never got rid of the feeling that I was wrestling with gravity. Maybe thats how its supposed to feel, like its this great force that can never be truly tamed, but it also felt like I was never really improving, either. Right until the end, I found trial-and-error and patience were just as valuable as my newfound abilities.', ""\n\nWhat's strange is that Gravity Ghosts lays groundwork for more complexity and different types of puzzles, yet never capitalizes on it. For instance, you can cycle through different unlockable outfits to transform planets into lush jungle worlds, balls of unset lava, or a number of things in between, each with their own gravitational properties.. Initially, I assumed it was going to be how you tame gravity, so I began experimenting, creating fire planets, which make you jump a little higher, and crystal planets, which are superdense and warp the fabric of space around them and slow you down. But I soon realised it didnt really matter. Barring a few exceptions, most levels can be solved without any terraforming whatsoever. Its a shame, since its presented as a substantial mechanic, and is used to uncover more about the girls past, but in terms of the individual level design it feels oddly inessential."", '', 'That said, it rarely hindered my enjoyment, since this is the kind of puzzle where the idea of challenge seems incidental; its much more concerned with wrapping a sad tale in a distinctive, weirdly pleasurable sensory experience. In short, Gravity Ghost wants you to enjoy the act of feeding lettuce to a giant space rabbit, rather than make that into a challenge.', 'And when it comes to mood, Gravity Ghost truly excels. The music is superb, with piano and synth working in tandem to create a score that is both stirring and emotive; the art is vibrant and stimulating, yet its soft and friendly style prevent it from ever feeling garish. The voice acting is downright bizarre, too, with the delivery ranging from what sounds like archive recordings to the kind of intense bounciness you would expect from Saturday-morning cartoons. It feels like an episode of Adventure Times rerouted through the final act of 2001: A Space Odyssey; one minute youre learning about optics from a giant owl while fixing a lighthouse next to a black hole, the next youre uncovering more of about its buried, earth-bound story about this girl and her tragic death. Its amusing and odd, but also stark and poignant.']",IGN

Even 12 years after I first encountered them, it's genuinely frightening every time they spring back to life to try to tear a hole in my esophagus, but they're also a great example of why Resident Evil still holds up. While inconsistent art and persistent clipping problems give away that this is an update of a 1996 survival-horror game, the scares, puzzles, and atmosphere of the creepy corridors of Spencer Mansion are as potent as ever."", 'Ever since the tweaks made in the 2002 GameCube remake, Resident Evil has been a tense game of resource management. The makeover to the many rooms, puzzles, and monsters give it an edge that significantly surpasses the original game. Every zombie you spend precious ammunition to kill becomes a ticking time bomb thatll turn into something much more deadly if you dont dispose of them properly with fire or headshots.', 'That persistent danger is what makes the frequent backtracking through this labyrinth of locked doors something more interesting than typical busywork. As Resident Evil uses adventure game-style design to send you looking for keys and objects that have to be examined closely to solve puzzles, then brought back to the right location, you can feel the stakes rising as the chances of getting mauled or caught without the right resources increase.', 'Resident Evil is a gauntlet of twisted monsters and hard decisions. Make the wrong choice or take too long on some objectives, and sometimes youll pay for it with the death of a comrade or missing out on precious resources. Its punishing at times, and managing the different inventories of two playable characters forces you to be smart and frugal with regard to what you carry with you. The constant pressure makes it a difficult game to play by design, but one that still manages to be fair.', 'This HD remastered edition of Resident Evil looks pretty good on the new-gen consoles, thanks to 1080p resolution and some nicely touched up backgrounds and textures, with the PC version offering the highest settings and a nifty option to switch between 60 and 30 frames per second. The biggest improvement across all versions is the ability to scale the experience the way you want to play it. You could choose between 4:3 or 16:9 aspect ratios, and you can swap the original tank-style controls for a more modern setup that moves your character in the direction you push the stick.', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'As an old fan I prefer the original controls, but the new controls help make Resident Evil accessible without sacrificing the tense nature of combat. You still have to stand your ground in order to shoot zombies and deal with the pressure of enemies getting closer. Since most face-offs happen in tight spaces, its not super easy to pull a juke move on multiple zombies, even with the new controls. Purists can have it the way the designers originally intended. Newbies can jump in and not completely break the game.', 'Dimly lit rooms with ambient effects like lightning or floating dust particles are some of the best to look at in this update. However, some backdrops look garish under a lot of light, and there are some noticeably blurry textures and pixelated art. Im also disappointed that the major clipping problems still havent been fixed. Maybe in the next remake, Capcom?']",IGN
80,Dying Light,26-Jan-15,Mikel Reparaz,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/26/dying-light-review,"["" [Note: Final review posted February 2, 2015] It may be squalid and zombie-infested, but Dying Light's city of Harran isn't a depressing wasteland  it's a vibrant, ambitious, open-world playground. Here, buildings are for climbing, the undead are there to be destroyed in creative ways, and there's always something interesting to be discovered nearby. It takes a while for that to become clear, though; at first, you might even think Dying Light is really about running scared from mobs of seemingly unconquerable zombies, who can quickly drain your stamina and wear out your improvised weapons. Don't be fooled."", ""Yes, it's a struggle to survive in Dying Light's early hours. Combat is initially clumsy, with the diverse and deadly zombies able to soak up a disturbing amount of punishment before they die for good. Jumping  which is unintuitively mapped to shoulder buttons on consoles  can take a while to get used to. Getting mobbed is usually a death sentence. So is attracting the attention of the much more dangerous things that come out when daytime dynamically gives way to night, at which point the focus shifts to tense stealth  or, if youre discovered, an adrenaline-pumping sprint for the nearest safe point."", ""Before long, though, you'll build up a skill set that turns your rotting foes into objects of fun, letting you vault across their shoulders, quickly slice them apart with dramatic slow-motion kills, or trick them into gathering around explosives before blasting them all into the sky. Even nighttime becomes an opportunity to raise skills faster thanks to increased XP gain, rather than a period of sheer terror. It all feels great, too; once you adjust to the controls, Dying Light's first-person parkour becomes natural and fluid, and weaving high-speed paths through its decaying slums and picturesque old-world buildings is so much fun that I almost don't hate the lack of a fast-travel option."", ""Combat, meanwhile, gets increasingly satisfying, although it never quite loses its awkwardness. Even when expertly shredding zombies with elementally charged tools of death I built myself, strikes are still heavy and clumsy. And while the guns you'll find later can pop heads from a distance, their low rate of fire and zombie-attracting noise makes them more of an occasional quick fix than a game-changing weapon. To Dying Light's credit, though, your adversaries are surprisingly capable; while the rank-and-file Biters are dumb and fun to manipulate, more powerful enemies  like the quick, agile Virals  are formidable close-quarters opponents, ducking your strikes and sidestepping out of your reach while looking for an opening to attack. Hostile bandits are even deadlier, able to dodge and block at close quarters, throw knives from a distance, and use guns and group tactics to kill you if you get overconfident."", ""That Dying Light's world is so entertaining is important, because it's unexpectedly huge. Finishing the campaign took me more than 34 hours, with a 68 percent completion rate. The story is serviceable enough, focusing on an undercover agent who becomes a savior to infected survivors and a thorn in the side of a maniacal warlord, but the most surprising thing about it might be its lack of surprises. Similar games have primed me to expect shocks and betrayals that will yank the metaphorical rug out from beneath me, and yet apart from a few big twists early on, Dying Light plays it mostly straight, with little nuance and few hidden agendas from its interesting (but underdeveloped) characters and entertainingly cliche villains. In a way it's almost refreshing, even if the end result is nothing special."", ""A big chunk of my time, though, was spent on detours into side quests, which are where the storytelling really shines. Taking on one of the many requests from random survivors might lead to something ordinary, like a fetch quest  but more often than not, they're multi-part adventures with their own short storylines, which frequently start out as seemingly run-of-the-mill tasks and escalate into something much more lurid and creepy. A search for a missing person, for example, might turn into a hunt for progressively more unsettling clues in a seemingly abandoned apartment building, and a routine rescue mission might turn out to be a trap set by a conniving madman. These are some of Dying Light's most memorable moments, and they make exploring its world even more rewarding."", ""While it's entirely playable as a single-player game, Dying Light is  like most things  better with friends along. Up to three co-op partners can jump in at any time to help you carve up undead hordes, watch your back while you're picking locks, or pursue campaign missions, and while the online matchmaking is still fairly hit-or-miss on PS4, online sessions are smooth and stable once they get going."", '\n', 'It\'s also useful to have friends around if your game is invaded through the ""Be the Zombie"" mode, which lets a random player jump into your world as a super-powered monster with zipline tendrils and zombie-summoning spit. Playing as said monster is hugely enjoyable, especially after youve unlocked some of its grosser attacks, but it feels one-sided unless you\'re going up against at least two human players.', '', '\n', ""Other than moderately better visuals, the PC version's biggest leg up on its console counterparts is its customizable keyboard-and-mouse controls. Keeping track of the assorted key functions can be a little trying when things get frantic, but using the space bar to jump still feels more immediately natural than R1 or RB on PS4 or Xbox One. (Gamepads are, of course, supported.) Early on, there were reports that Dying Light would hang before dialogue or cutscenes, but these issues appear to have been patched, and the PC version now mostly runs smoothly for us, with only rare hitching while areas load. There is, however, an occasional issue with some textures popping in at low resolution and sticking that way. The PS4 version has a similar problem, but while it quickly corrects itself, textures that show up blurry on PC tend to stay that way."", '\n']",IGN

For the most part, I enjoyed playing Chaos Heroes Onlines fast-paced, defense-focused spin on the MOBA formula, but I didnt like looking at or listening to it, and some broken systems mean it has a lot of improving to do before it becomes a game worth investing time into.', 'Chaos Heroes Onlines main map, Ancient Forest, has the familiar MOBA layout: three lanes, a base for each team of five, a river that divides the map, and a jungle filled with neutral enemies on both sides. Theres a Warcraft III feel to the art of the map (as this game, like DoTA, sprang from Blizzards RTS), but the bland, low-resolution textures are eyesores, and character animations are awkward. The interface is fine, unless it automatically reverts to the classic Warcraft III mode, in which case the frame is huge and blocks too much of the screen. Pop-ups announcing killstreaks are also guilty of obstructing the action.', 'One thing that really sets Chaos Heroes Online apart from other MOBAs (especially League of Legends and Dota 2) is its pace. Everything moves quickly, and it feels great. Leveling your character is fast, you can buy items from anywhere on the map (so you dont have to leave the lane or jungle), and with cheap survivability items, its easy to jump in and out of team fights. With a hard 50-minute time limit, things need to move fast to push past the four layers of defense that protect the enemy teams base. Pushing down towers or the powerful sentinels is difficult alone, so theres a nice emphasis on teamwork and team composition.', 'In addition to Ancient Forest, theres another custom-only map, Shrine of Life  a much smaller map that has a 20-minute deathmatch mode. It was nice to have some variety, but it was a big let down when I couldnt find others to play with. In fact, the player base for Chaos Heroes Online is so small that people in the general chat had to work together just to get a quick match in Ancient Forest going. My custom game didnt stand a chance of getting a full lobby, so I resorted to playing with bots.', 'That didnt go well, because the bots in Shrine of Life are terribly broken. My bot teammates often didnt respond when I started team fights and they would sometimes stand still in a corner of the map until something happened. The same goes for the enemy bots. I had to sacrifice myself to four enemy bots in order for them do something other than just stand in the river. (I didnt experience these AI issues in the Ancient Forest, for what its worth.) Ive pretty much given up on Shrine of Life as a result.', 'If you do join the tiny player pool, youll find the 78 heroes available for purchase or free with the weekly rotation are fun and easy to learn. Almost all, except some support heroes, heavily rely on their right-click auto attack, but this doesnt mean their skills arent useful. For example, Chans right-click can be crazy strong, but combined with Earthen Ring  a skill that traps heroes in a circle of rocks  and his damage spell Flaming Bite, hes a major powerhouse in a team fight. After a few minutes, it was easy to learn how to properly use the skills in order to put out the most damage possible. Theyre not overly complicated, and that makes playing as new heroes more inviting and enjoyable.', 'Playing against them, on the other hand, is made less fun by the confusing and off-putting art style of their skins. By default, theyre in keeping with the Warcraft III fantasy theme, but purchasable skins look like shamelessly sexed-up anime characters or weird bobble heads, which ensures that matches look like a visual mess of clashing styles. Worse, some skins change the gender and personality of a hero, to the point where they might as well be a totally different character. That can be confusing in battle because its harder to know what a given character can do at a glance. And, save for a select few, the voice acting for both male and female heroes is just bad. Thankfully, theres an option to turn off their annoying in-game banter.']",IGN

Everything, from the world design to the battle animation to the fact that you can dumpster-dive for items, is lifted straight from the 90s cult classic. Naturally, this appealed to my sense of 8- and 16-bit nostalgia, but Citizens didnt just rely on fuzzy memory of days gone by in order to charm me. It also introduced a litany of hilarious characters who represent the best and worst of what humanity has to offer.

This real bit of instruction may sound like a no-brainer, but the process of getting to said building was ridiculously convoluted. I spent hours searching for an entrance, checking the map over and over (and over) again looking for hidden caves or trails. I even got up from my chair to trace paths on the map with my finger. Where was the heck was the entrance?', 'As it turns out, I had to go to the area next to the desert, visit a casino, make my way across a river, then circle back to the desert from a different direction  none of which felt the least bit intuitive. Add to that a pack of tenacious cats made out of cacti attacking my party every three seconds (high enemy-encounter rates are another pacing issue) and it was a wonder I made it to the end of the mission. Im aware that developer Eden Industries set out to recreate the style and feel of the 16-bit era, but we moved beyond maps and frequent enemy encounters for a reason.', 'Luckily, the sluggish tempo on the world map doesnt carry over into battles. Fights are quick and fun thanks to each of the 40 citizens quirky set of attacks, buffs, and defenses. In a clever twist, the VP himself doesnt fight  he just stands there making quips and letting everyone else do the work for him. I chuckled whenever the computer nerd attacked enemies using hexadecimal and binary code, the bodybuilder used buffs to power up his next move, or the baker healed the party with copious amounts of pastries. I also appreciated that each citizen had a secondary talent off the battlefield. I couldnt have gotten very far without the help of the spunky helicopter pilot who flew me to remote locations, or the dumb-as-bricks bodybuilder who lifted obstacles out of my way. Its this mix of abilities that made having an array of citizens in my party essential as well as fun.', '', 'We promise a Moonbucks on every corner!', 'The process of getting them on my team wasnt fun, however. Almost every single character required me to complete a sidequest or compete with them in a mini-game, and those were just as poorly designed and unintuitive as the main quests. The only reason I managed to recruit the photographer was because I accidentally stumbled onto a location she wanted to use for a photoshoot.', 'And, alas, there are technical glitches. There were times I got stuck trying to get around obstacles while driving or walking. There is noticeable screen tearing. And although It only happened to me a couple of times on PC, the PS4 version crashed on me several times. Thank goodness for autosave!', 'Annoying as that was it was hard to stay mad for very long, since the constant jokes, retro-style graphics pulled straight from the 50s and kooky music worked together to keep a grin on my face.

The mouse controls are likewise simple, with item-specific action pop-ups and a glow around objects that are interactive.', 'Dont expect all the latest bells and whistles while playing Supreme League of Patriots. The visuals deliver the bright, colorful characters and settings of a comic book send-up, but the animations and voice-overs need work. In particular, the Purple Patriot pivots and walks with the speed of a tortoise. It can take a few seconds just for him to start moving after an action is clicked. And while the supporting characters are acted well, Kyle and Melvin often sound like theyre just reading lines off a page. Its okay with Melvin, though -- hes British and has that whole Simon Pegg thing going for him.']",IGN
84,Grim Fandango Remastered,26-Jan-15,Ryan McCaffrey,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/26/grim-fandango-remastered-review,"['Playing classic adventure Grim Fandango again is like seeing a skeleton get up and start walking around  which is exactly what afterlife travel agent Manny Calavera does in this Day of the Dead-inspired tale. It joyously exhumes the corpses of both fallen genre titan LucasArts and Grim Fandango itself, whose out-of-print and unsupported status had rendered it nearly impossible to find  let alone play  over the past decade and a half.', 'Adventure games tend to age better than other genres because their gameplay is so story-focused, and so its no surprise that Grim Fandango remains a fine experience in 2015. However, one missed opportunity for improvement is that, like many games of the 90s, there is no tutorial available. Youre simply thrown headfirst into the adventure, and any How do I do that? questions that wouldve been answered by the thick instruction manual you were expected to read before you played (heck, it was part of the fun!) are left a mystery here. As a $15 download, Grim Remastered obviously doesnt include a booklet. And while you can check the button layout in the Options screen  Fandango feels completely natural on DualShock 4, by the way, and theres a new feels-like-it-was-always-there point-and-click interface option on PC  youre given no other context for what youre actually supposed to do. If youre familiar with Telltales modern adventures, youll have a basic idea, but Grim is a much deeper, more complex quest than the Walking Deads and Wolves Among Us youre used to nowadays.', 'As I progressed, Grim reminded me that adventure games of yore expected a lot more from players than most games do today. Thats hardly a bad thing, but it can be a bit jarring if youre coming to this classic for the first time. Over this beautiful and dramatic 12-hour adventure, youll have to talk to a lot of memorable characters, collect a lot of items, and use them in creative and often bizarre ways, so youll need either an excellent memory or a notepad and pen to keep track of your current goals (especially if you take a day or two off in the middle of your playthrough). Its a lot to keep track of, and Grim Fandango wont help you out in any way.', 'The four-year tale of Manny as he tries to work off spiritual debts by selling expedited afterlife travel to paradise (read: heaven) so he can eventually get there himself is a gripping one, packed with film noir influences, a stellar jazzy soundtrack, and light touches of comedy too. Its split into four years, with each one  particularly the film noir-heavy Year 2  chock full of locations, characters, and items. Glottis, your netherworld demon sidekick whose sole reason to exist is to drive vehicles, is easily my favorite character  particularly as his role evolves into piano player, lounge singer, and shipman. But even the archetypal NPCs are well-written, well-acted, and generally interesting.', 'I say this is a 12-hour story, but like any adventure game, youll only progress as fast as you can solve puzzles, and that will vary depending on how good you are at sussing out wacky adventure game logic. Most of your challenges make sense, but I wouldnt call any of them flat-out easy. More often than not, theres something that requires you to dig into your gray matter a bit deeper than a modern game would. Frustration is inevitable  its part of the genre  but when you finally figure out what you missed, its incredibly rewarding.', 'However, while I never flat-out cheated on any puzzles by looking up their solutions online, I do wish Grim Fandango Remastered had added a hint system similar to the stellar Monkey Island 1 and 2 Special Editions, which provided bigger and bigger hints as you continued to press the hint button before ultimately giving you the solution. The one puzzle that made me absolutely mental was (no spoilers) the multi-part counterfeit betting-stub machine task near the end of Year 2. Be ready for that.', 'Just as the excellent craft behind Grims story means its no less engrossing today than it was in 1998, its 3D graphics have also held up surprisingly well. Because Grim has such unique art direction, its low-polygon characters havent aged as poorly as youd expect. In fact, the original pre-rendered backgrounds help the graphics look borderline modern. Thus, switching back and forth between the original and remastered graphics on the fly only changes the characters, whose detail and lighting are cleaned up for 2015. The only thing that really disappointed me was the lack of a true 16:9 widescreen aspect ratio (a stretched 16:9 option is available, but it looks awful), which means were stuck with black bars on the sides of our screens.', 'Not much has changed about the content of this game, but the developer commentary track, which serves up stories and memories from over a half-dozen key creators, including designer Tim Schafer, is a delightful cherry on top. Its filled with fun facts and humorous retrospective observations about what was going on in the heads of the tightly bonded team who put this thing together. Theyre sprinkled liberally throughout the story, and theyre only a button press away. And since the commentary almost never spoils puzzles, I highly recommend turning it on in the Special Features menu before you begin.', '', '', 'Should you elect to play Grim Fandango Remastered on the Vita, youll be in for a portable treat. The handheld version cleverly offers both the PS4s gamepad controls and the PCs point-and-click controls simultaneously, letting you mix and match on the fly and on a whim. Visuals look clean on the Vitas screen, too, though the 4:3 aspect ratio is extra painful here because of the already limited screen real estate (again, do not attempt to use the hideous 16:9 stretching option). On a similar note, the Vitas screen also occasionally stings during scenes when the camera is pulled way back, making Manny a mere few pixels tall. But Cross-Buy and Cross-Save functionality means your $15 gets you both PlayStation versions, and youre able to seamlessly carry your save files back and forth between the two. Thats a huge plus.']",IGN
85,Raven's Cry,3-Feb-15,Brandin Tyrrel,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/03/ravens-cry-review,"['In medieval times, dangerous and unexplored areas of the sea were marked on maps with drawings of sea monsters and the words, Here be dragons, so as to be avoided. Well, Ravens Cry is lousy with dragons. The first time I booted it up, it crashed. The second time, another crash. On the third, I was finally able to begin my adventure as the hook-handed pirate Captain Christopher Raven, but that shaky beginning was a pretty clear sign of things to come. In fact, its a fitting analogy for Ravens Cry itself: its naval combat delivers high-seas adventure, but it never finds its land legs. Ultimately, my voyage through the main quest was sunk by a game-stopping bug, but I dont feel like I missed out by not being able to finish the story.', 'Gameplay is divided into two separate and unequal aspects: The best part is on the open seas, where youll captain a progression of unlockable and upgradeable ships, from the lowly schooner to the mighty Man-o-War, scuttling boats and fleets in randomly generated encounters with the British, French, Spanish, and pirate factions vying for control of trade in the West Indies. Maritime battles play out fast, in real time, and somewhat tactically. Theres some skill involved in choosing the right munitions to damage a ships sails, hull, or crew, and then adjusting the elevation and aim of each salvo to compensate for the crests and bows of the seas churning waves.', 'The ship management lends a sense of personal customization to the otherwise on-rails nature of Ravens Cry. Youll find officers scattered throughout the Caribbean that can be hired to augment your ship  a good carpenter, for example, can make repairs at sea if youve got the necessary timber and sail cloth onboard, saving you a trip back to shore. And ship upgrades provide considerable power, speed and durability: The first time I annihilated an attacking pirate galleon with a single broadside of cannons, I couldnt help but laugh -- the scourge of the seas, indeed.', ""Choosing whether to sink a vessel for a small chunk of experience and a few trinkets, or risk getting close enough to board and plunder their cargo helps make naval combat worthwhile, especially when those plundered goods can be sold for a premium at the port. My favorite moments in Ravens Cry are all about attacking a convoy of ships, disabling them before boarding, and selling their cargo of tea, coffee, silk, tobacco, and more to purchase upgrades my ship. There's a hint of something great here."", 'But on land, Ravens Cry is a linear string of errands and side quests, made worse by sluggish movement and rigid controls and poor combat. Getting stuck on the environment and being unable to hurdle waist-high obstacles doesnt feel like the way a swashbuckling pirate should interact with the world.', 'One of my least favorite chores is the long, uneventful walk from my ship to the merchant, the shipwright, and the trader, and then back to the docks to board my vessel. It might not seem like an issue, but with such cumbersome traversal on land, these mandatory pit stops for repairs and to offload cargo kill what little momentum Id built up out on the water.', 'Its even worse when youre forced into land-based combat. And I say forced, because nothing about Ravens Crys combat is fun, so I avoided it whenever possible. Its a barebones system comprised of a light and heavy sword attack, a few secondary items like a flintlock pistol, and a parry and dodge mechanic that suffer from clunky, unreliable input, and a nearly useless targeting system. Though fancier moves can be unlocked, I never found anything more effective than simply mashing the quick attack. But thanks to the poor AI and general inefficiency of combat, youre able to simply run past most engagements without so much as a scratch, so its often irrelevant except to gawk at how poorly its put together.', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'Visually, the aesthetic of the Caribbeans weathered port-town environments are well realized, and Ravens Cry can look respectable at times. Technical problems popped up constantly, though. I couldnt maintain a steady framerate on my Intel Core i5 3.4GHz processor and Nvidia GeForce GTX 760 GPU, and the textures, environments, and characters that pop in and out are ultimately too distracting to be overlooked.', 'But audio is Ravens Crys greatest weakness. Though the ambient soundtrack is actually quite pleasant, the voice work is particularly, noticeably bad, with the majority of characters delivering their lines in shades of awkward, and even comical. Captain Raven himself is the worst offender. Barking his lines as surly threats would be fine, because, you know... pirate  but his inflection never really seems to change. Its either total ambivalence or psychotic zeal, and nothing in between.', 'Elsewhere, its almost funny how inconsistent conversations are. Some characters dont have voice overs, so conversations are fully voiced on one side, and subtitled on the other. Sometimes theyll switch to subtitles mid-conversation; or their words cut out completely; or the camera is pointed at their feet, or a wall, or the sky, or anywhere other than their faces. There are so many glaring, broken moments any time two people try to exchange words in Ravens Cry that eventually I just wanted to start skipping the dialogue and pretend it didnt exist.', 'Fittingly enough, with all these technical issues weighing down, my journey ended when that weight became too much to bear. At nearly a dozen hours into Captain Ravens adventure, during a main story quest called The Sleeper Awakes, my game repeatedly crashed at the same section, every single time. Despite reloading earlier saves and trying to work around the problem, this halt in progression has prevented me from wrapping up the tale of revenge.']",IGN
86,Saints Row IV: Gat Out of Hell,21-Jan-15,Mikel Reparaz,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/21/saints-row-iv-gat-out-of-hell-review,"['Where some games portray Hell as a place of eternal torment, Saints Row IV: Gat Out of Hells vision of the Inferno is almost as mundane and silly as its surface world, and a little more fun to explore. A neon-drenched (but decidedly last-gen-looking) new city about half the size of SR4\'s Steelport, it\'s filled with undead ""husks"" shambling around and driving hideous junkers, all under the watchful eyes of buff guardian demons. It features depressing-looking businesses (quick, who wants to visit the Sad Cans strip club?) and distinct landmarks (like a Ferris wheel built to drown its riders), all surrounded by a jagged-rock-and-molten-lava motif. It\'s also where the President  that is, your protagonist from Saints Row IV  has been kidnapped by Satan himself, thus setting the stage for Saints Row: Gat Out of Hell, a short and entertaining (but strangely paced) standalone expansion.', '\n', ""With the President out of action, the focus shifts to tough-as-nails gangster Johnny Gat and hacker Kinzie Kensington. You can swap between the pair at any time (or play them side-by-side in co-op), although the only real difference is in the dialogue you'll hear; while she lacks his cool knife executions, it turns out Kinzie's just as capable on the street as Gat."", ""Granted, within the first few minutes of play a halo stolen from Satan bestows more or less the same superpowers from Saints Row IV, with a few key differences. Telekinesis, for example, has been replaced with Summon, which calls up an annoying imp to latch onto your enemies and explode. Other, more familiar powers now have hell-themed elemental effects, like Blast's new ability to turn enemies to stone. And not only can Gat and Kinzie run super fast and leap over buildings, but they can actually fly using an pair of angel wings, which add a fun new dimension to exploring Hell, grabbing its endless collectible upgrade orbs, and pursuing its new side activities."", ""You're introduced to these new powers (and to the supporting cast) in a series of brief but memorable introductory missions, which are really the only time you'll play through what could be considered a story quest. Once those are done, your purpose is to attract Satan's attention by completing side activities  a strange design choice that teeters dangerously close to repetitive monotony, but does make side tasks feel more vital and worthwhile. Once you've finished a certain number of those tasks, cutscenes will play to advance the story and introduce new hazards  and that's the pattern you'll stick with until the final shootout with Satan."", ""It helps that a lot of the side tasks are surprisingly fun. New activities include batting hordes of demonic frat boys into glowing portals, mowing down waves of demons to claim fast-travel points, hunting for hidden glyphs to unlock chests, and flying through high-speed aerial races, most of which are pretty enjoyable even after Id done them a few times. The highlight, however, is Torment Fraud, which adds a new twist to the familiar ragdoll-into-traffic Insurance Fraud minigame. Here, you're playing as a condemned soul  complete with a Jane Austen-narrated backstory  out to shave years off your infernal sentence, and as you're hit by cars in quick succession, you'll gain the ability to make vehicles explode on contact, which throws you higher into the air and creates ridiculously chaotic chains of wrecked cars and deliberate injuries."", ""It also helps that the story  when it's in play  is wonderfully goofy, bringing together dead historical figures, familiar faces from earlier Saints Row games, and a wryly out-of-place musical number right in the middle. While the supporting characters come with interesting backstories, however, it would've been great to see them fleshed out a bit more; Shakespeare as Hell's disgraced spymaster is a cool premise, as is Blackbeard's insistence on living off the grid, but they never really go anywhere beyond their introductions. Couple that with a choice of five short, somewhat unsatisfying endings, and it feels like a lot more narrative and comedy could have been wrung out of Gat Out of Hell's four- to-six-hour runtime."", ""Devilish new weapons are also fun to discover and play around with. Aside from a selection of familiar guns with demonic makeovers, Gat Out of Hells destructive implements are themed after the Seven Deadly Sins, most of which have to be found scattered around the world. Sloth, for example, is represented by a moving easy chair with mounted Gatling guns and rockets that fire when you recline, while Pride is a talking pistol called the Gallows Dodger. Wrath, meanwhile, is nothing less than the Ark of the Covenant, which can suck up enemies and use them as ammo. Some of these are more novel than useful  the Armchair-A-Geddon, for example, moves too slowly to be helpful in a serious firefight  but they're all an enjoyable change of pace, especially when it comes to random street violence.""]",IGN
87,The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 3D,4-Feb-15,Marty Sliva,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/04/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask-3d-review,"['Majoras Mask is easily the strangest, most risk-taking adventure in the Zelda series. Its completely unlike any of Links other games, and delivers a tense, bizarre, and somber exploration of what its like to experience the end of the world, again and again. Most of its crazy ideas pay off just as well on the Nintendo 3DS today as they did in the N64 original 15 years ago, which is the mark of a great game. A handful of design decisions havent aged as well, though, and some of the changes made to the 3DS remaster left me a bit confused throughout my 20-hour adventure. On the whole, its absolutely worth the time to play or revisit.', 'Majoras Masks core Groundhog Day-like conceit is a deep puzzle in and of itself. Time is always of the essence -- the 72 hours until the world ends is constantly ticking down, and you have to tie up any loose ends you have before using the Song of Time to travel back to the start of the cycle. While certain items and knowledge carry over to next playthrough, most interactions you have with characters and the world itself are reset with each revolution. However, theres great satisfaction in moving the goal post a bit further every time you restart a cycle.', 'Theres a really great amount of tension in having to complete the task at hand within the time limit. Watching the minutes tick by -- in Majoras Mask, an in-game hour takes about 45 seconds -- and having to meticulously manage your precious time provides some great experiences. Fighting the boss of a dungeon during the waning hours of the final day is stressful, but landing that final blow with only minutes to spare is fantastically satisfying.', 'Exploring the world is constantly interesting due to the density and multiple layers of the map and its inhabitants. Theyre extremely weird, and I mean that in the best possible way. Non-stop oddities make each turn of the adventure a memorable, dream-like event. UFOs are causing a ruckus at Romani Ranch, ghosts roam the world, and one side-quest has you helping out a disembodied hand that resides in a toilet. Piecing together characters stories, motivations, and goals over three days is a treat, and doing it again armed with new information from the last cycle and special items that carry over exposes new facets. Even the side-quests are rich with story, and definitely worth completing.', 'Throughout all of this, the terrifying moon lingers in the sky, grinning at you with apocalyptic joy. The colorful nature original Majoras Mask looks even better now, thanks to improved textures, draw distance, and some really great use of 3D. All of these strange, atmospheric occurrences add an effective layer of sadness to the world, and make Termina as textured and memorable as any version of Hyrule weve seen.', 'The other big but effective departure from Zelda conventions in Majoras Mask is that most of your powers and upgrades come from the 24 masks scattered across Termina. The three core masks allow you to fly as a Deku Scrub, roll as a Goron, and swim as a Zora. These add a lot of depth to how Link moves through the world, and each contribute to some really great puzzles throughout the adventure.', 'On the other hand, a few of Majoras risks dont pay off as well. A prime example is that this adventure features only four major dungeons, and not all of them are as great as the Stone Temple. That one a real test of wits that throws in puzzles that require you to carefully hop between all three of your main masks, and proves to be one of the toughest, but most satisfying dungeons the Zelda series has ever created. On the flip side, the Great Bay Temple is bloated, filled with unintuitive puzzles, and far too long. Considering its a quarter of Majoras dungeons, its disappointing to say the least.', 'At the end of the dungeons, though, are some of the most interesting Zelda bosses ever. Majoras Mask retains the same excellent Z-targeting and pattern memorization thats been a staple of the series since Ocarina of Time, but the additional abilities of the three major masks adds a new layer to each encounter. A boss battle that highlights this is Goht, a giant mechanical bull that you have to fight while in wearing your Goron Mask and rolling around an arena. It plays out like a tense, puzzle-filled version of the chariot scene from Ben Hur, and theres nothing else like it.', 'A few new tools, including the ability to set in-game reminders and precise control over skipping ahead in time, make it easy to optimize your schedule. That being said, I wish the information you learn about the characters and their schedules was tracked and presented in a more manageable and digestible manner. The Bombers Notebook, your in-game secretary, isnt all that intuitive, and I found myself having to constantly scribble down real-world notes about where people would be at certain times, and in which order I had to complete objectives in order to finish a specific quest. Especially on a portable system like the 3DS, thats an inconvenience.']",IGN
88,Life is Strange -- Episode 1: American Chrysalis,2-Feb-15,Mitch Dyer,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/02/life-is-strange-episode-1-review,"['Aside from its poor dialogue, Life is Strange reminds me most of a Rob Thomas television series. Like Veronica Mars or iZombie, developer Dontnods episodic drama stars a regular young woman with an extraordinary quality. Main character Max Caulfield can, for unexplained reasons, rewind time. Aside from that, shes a typical teenage girl. She has friends, personal problems, passions, dreams, a little crush, and other believable qualities. But a combination of ambition and obligation drive her to use her talents, wit, and personality to make the world a better place. With all of that going for it, Life is Strange: Episode 1 - Chrysalis is the first step toward something fascinating and personable, but its laughable script and worse performances obstruct its otherwise touching, human story.', 'Max Caulfield is, mercifully, a likable person. Shes introduced as quiet, shy, introverted, and even unremarkable despite her presence in a prestigious high school. Throughout Chrysalis, by way of your choices, Max reveals herself as a strong, capable, and smart person who defies her awkward stereotype. The story tests these qualities by presenting a plain teenager with challenging dilemmas -- the results of which she can alter at will.', 'Her mundane and meaningful choices can be undone, remade, and tailored to whatever future you want to create for Max. Against all odds, the gravity of her decisions is not lost when repairing the past. I like this system -- it let me not only consider what might happen, but live it, and undo it if I didnt like it, as every teenager probably wished they could.', 'Typically, the consequences for your dialogue decisions arent immediately apparent. Max expresses worry or regret, in most cases, regardless of what she chooses, because the dilemmas have no clear sense of victory right away. Max can see the short-term results of what shes done, but once she commits to a decision and moves on, theres no going back. Her abilities are limited, and even she doesnt understand why.', 'Why she can rewind time isnt apparent, but it allows you to explore a believable setting in interesting ways. If Max upsets her teacher, she can go back, impress him, and feel better about herself. It feels both exploitative and satisfying to use people against themselves, but Max moves through the world trying to help people -- never hurt them. Seeing someone get bullied sucks, but what if you could go back and save them from ever feeling upset?', 'Not every interaction hinges on a big choice, though. Many conversations give context to this world. The most notable side-arc is that of Rachel Amber, a missing student with connections (both good and bad) to many of the people Max runs around with. The unreliable principle, a student bringing a gun to school, and a try-hard tough guy of a security guard will no doubt come into play later in the series, and Im interested in all of it.', 'Life is Strange is a choice-based adventure game with a time-traveling teenager at the center, but Max is, ironically, the most grounded and believable character in the entire cast. Most of the people around her are predictable and boring archetypes, with the actors delivering on-the-nose dialogue with more adolescent awkwardness than any of its characters exhibit themselves. Toward the end of Chrysalis, Maxs rebellious, stoner acquaintance recommends, You need to get high, its been a hella insane f***ing day. Another character, lacking any semblance of subtlety, threatens, I will remember this conversation.', ""In some ways, Life is Strange lacks maturity. Just because its about people figuring themselves out doesnt mean things should be handled without grace. I dont believe many of these people are teenagers, and I dont believe many of these teenagers are people -- and thats a huge problem for a young-adult drama that relies on personality and humanity. Maxs friend Chloe lives a life full of baggage that really made me feel for her. Every time she spoke, I rolled my eyes, and the empathy evaporated. The principal's lack of concern when Max mentions a student has a gun really shocked me -- how can this person not take a claim like that with at least a little dread?"", 'And its a shame, because for all of the writing and acting problems in Life is Strange, the scenarios it creates are genuinely interesting, and I want to see how Max handles things going forward. Even if the lines arent believable, a lot of the scenarios are. In snooping around other girls rooms for intel, I felt like I should not be here. Helping an upset friend with her bad boyfriend felt as good as giving the mouthpiece popular girl what she deserved -- but rewinding, taking the high road, and trying to turn an enemy into a friend felt better. Heres hoping that pays off.']",IGN
89,Saints Row IV: Re-Elected & Gat Out of Hell,19-Jan-15,Mikel Reparaz,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/19/saints-row-4-re-elected-review,"['When IGN reviewed Saints Row IV in 2013 on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC, we awarded it a score of 7.3, for good. Heres what we said then:', 'With its recycled map and wildly overpowered abilities, playing Saints Row IV feels a lot like enabling god-like cheat codes in Saints Row The Third and going nuts. Its ridiculous story, goofy characters, self-aware humor, and amazing character editor make it all work, especially for those of us whove played the previous games and can appreciate its in-jokes. But its appeal is shortened by the ludicrous speed at which we can zip across it and grow tired of its lack of challenge.', '', ""It's just as much fun in Saints Row IV: Re-Elected for Xbox One and PlayStation 4, which repackages the old-gen original with all of its DLC and a strangely paced but creative new standalone adventure, Gat Out of Hell."", ""Visually, Re-Elected offers a small but noticeable improvement over the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of Saints Row IV. Obviously its higher resolution, the lighting's a bit nicer, character models are slightly more detailed, and everything moves a little more smoothly as you glide past at high speeds. It's not a huge bump, though, and it's still not quite as good-looking as the PC version was in 2013. Also, Re-Elected's only new gameplay features are a spate of neat-but-superfluous voice commands  which save you the trouble of using the d-pad to switch powers, or the pause menu to summon AI partners  and the option to use the PS4's touchpad during quick-time events, so theres no real replay value if you played the original."", ""Then again, Saints Row IV was never notable as a technical marvel. Its appeal comes more from bounding through its familiar, bland city of Steelport  now with an alien, intentionally glitchy-looking makeover  with upgradable superpowers that make its highly customizable vehicles completely obsolete after just a couple of hours. Its weapons are bizarre (and occasionally obscene), its character-customization options are wildly varied, and its map is littered with destructively fun things to do. And while its story missions annoyingly strip you of your powers, they compensate with unique and unexpected experiences that range from quasi-2D beat-'em-ups to narrated text adventures."", '', '', '', '', '', 'In these respects, Re-Elected still holds up beautifully. It also piles on content, including two short expansions: Enter the Dominatrix, the deliberately unfinished DLC that Saints Row IV grew out of; and How the Saints Save Christmas, a cheesy adventure that involves mowing down malevolent gingerbread men in a bid to free Santa from alien captivity.', ""The centerpiece, however, is Gat Out of Hell, a fun, four- to six-hour single-player or co-op adventure that sees Kinzie and Johnny Gat diving into Hell to rescue the President. Using Lucifer's stolen halo, the pair can use familiar superpowers to explore the underworld  which, despite being completely new, feels strangely like a smaller Steelport with an infernal re-skinning. However, being able to explore Hell by actually flying feels even more liberating than SRIV's jumping and gliding, and it makes hoovering up collectible power-up orbs even more enjoyable. And the new weapons, including a minigun-equipped armchair and the Ark of the Covenant  which uses enemies as ammo  are a blast for mowing down guardian demons."", ""Interestingly, Gat Out of Hell doesn't really feature traditional story missions. Instead, it tasks you with completing handfuls of side activities for its condemned supporting characters, and triggers cutscenes once you've finished a certain number of them. It's an odd, somewhat repetitive approach, although making side tasks key to story progression does make them feel a lot more worthwhile. Especially because said story  which involves dead historical figures, fourth wall-breaking cameos, and a Disney-esque musical number -- is one of the more entertaining to come out of the series since, well, Saints Row IV itself. It's just a shame that Gat doesn't stand up quite as well as Re-Elected, performance-wise; not only does it look similarly last-gen, but at one point it bugged out badly on PlayStation 4, stuttering and halting until I reset it. It's also worth noting that while Gat comes on the Xbox One version's disc, playing it on PS4 requires a 7GB download using an included voucher.""]",IGN
90,#IDARB,13-Jan-15,Mitch Dyer,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/13/idarb-review,"['Watch a match of #IDARB, a 2D competitive multiplayer game for Xbox One, and nobody would blame you for feeling bewildered. Its fast-paced, chaotic, and often incomprehensible, but the winning team didnt get to the top of the leaderboard by chance. Part combo-based arcade game, part hockey, part basketball, and part Super Smash Bros., #IDARB is an intelligent, technical, and highly enjoyable little eSport. Just make sure you have a good number of players, or your teams will end up lopsided, bored, or both.', '#IDARB moves fast, and with two teams of two, matches are chaotic and ripe with opportunity for memorable plays. With four players on each team, #IDARB is borderline impossible to keep up with -- which makes playmakers feel all the better when a plan comes together. Setting up those big moments earns teams more points, too, and thats the hook.', 'Accuracy and precision takes skill, since you both move and aim with the left stick, and firing off a high-speed shot (or missing a pass) could cause the ball to bounce off the edges of the opponents net and back into your defensive zone. Everything about #IDARB relies on your reflexive, instant reactions to always-unpredictable events. Scoring is hard, but because #IDARB is so responsive and skill-centric, it makes getting a goal all the more rewarding -- and it gets even better as the player count increases.', 'Passing the ball to an airborne ally creates a combo multiplier that pays off with more points when they score, particularly if theyre farther away from the goal -- the farther you are, the more points you earn. The satisfaction of having a risky play send your score soaring over an opponents keeps both teams striving to make big moves. When a massive play failed, our room full of local players burst into hysterical screaming -- one side relieved, the other horrified, both ecstatic for their next opportunity.', 'A team of two is enough to get in position, pass the ball between players, and score goals by throwing the ball into a blocky net. Skilled players reveal themselves when intercepting passes and setting up alley-oop shots. Causing turnovers by blasting the offender with a burst of energy is essential as well; it disjoints possession, sending the ball loose into the multi-tiered playing field.', 'Erratic shifts in whos carrying the ball causes frantic communication in teams who play to win, which is simultaneously part of what makes #IDARB entertaining, and why its smart. Clearly explaining where you are, when youre available for a pass, and what youre planning, is challenging but crucial. Helpful visual language, like the line popping out of players calling for passes, give ball-carriers information amid the babbling chaos of their couch competitors.', 'And #IDARB is at its most enjoyable with a large competitive couch crew -- online multiplayer works, but I ran into persistent and significant problems. Most notably, it suffers from inconsistent latency issues that made each match a crap-shoot in performance; one would run smoothly, while the next had an unbearable frame rate that destroys the split-second timing that makes #IDARB a great game. Also, when playing alone at home, you cant queue into a multiplayer game with custom settings -- playing alone means playing 1v1. Playing with one local pal means queuing into a 2v2, etc.', '#IDARBs online multiplayer is neutered by an absence of matchmaking options, and I constantly wished I could jump into a four- or eight-player match when I didnt have guests. This extends to local play somewhat as well. If you have, say, three or five players, the teams end up uneven, and theres no way to fill the spot with an online player or A.I. bot -- and unbalanced teams led to one unhappy team every time.', 'Customization options are excellent, though. If youre all-in on #IDARB, you can create your own character sprites using a simple sprite editor. Its too small to allow for much sophistication, but it was enough to use that I could recreate my favorite Dota 2 Heroes, and recognize dozens of the pre-made Halo, The Walking Dead, Super TIME Force, and suspiciously Disney Princess-esque characters.', 'Using your sprites, or the included ones, you can create teams for tournaments, as well as give them their own intro music using #IDARBs easy-to-use and surprisingly great music tool. I spent a couple hours composing little themes, messing with drum rhythms, bass lines, and goofy sound effects, and found the editor fun to use because its simple without sacrificing depth. It only allows for four instrument layers, but it was sufficient enough for my musician coworkers to create awesome compositions.']",IGN

This brand-new area just outside of Sunset City includes a new batch of weapons, amps, collectibles, and more, but the biggest reinvigoration is a set of traversal methods that let you dive, dash, and leap across the water with Aquaman-like speed.', 'Seven story missions reunite you with the bionic Troop Master Bryllcream, who proves his worth in hilarious fashion by launching you face-first at the opposition. Sadly, the only thing new about this variety of OD is a fresh coat of petroleum and seaweed  a simple reskin of the original enemies  as they dont offer any new challenges or opportunities for new tactics beyond the occasional pool of ignitable oil. The hostile scab workers are also more of the same.', 'The Mooil Rig itself, on the other hand, is a wonderful extension of developer Insomniacs level design. Its brightly colored shipping crates, life rafts, and shipwrecks offer platforms with a great deal of verticality. The new aquatic traversal methods make zipping around the new area easy and fun as you dodge massive tentacles that destroy platforms left and right, or protect targets from incoming mortar fire. Its all backdropped by a picturesque sunset that frequently bathes you in orange hues as you glide across the water.', 'In the weapons department, this DLC is batting .500. One of my prayers from the main campaign is answered here with the Feel The Burn, a close-range flamethrower. However, the Rivet Blaster, which you can only buy after finishing the missions, feels out of place on the oil rig. Its great against robots, but there arent any here.', 'While Mystery of the Mooil Rig is delightfully varied by having you pilot the Glider one moment, and chasing a giant tentacled beast the next, the whole thing feels like just the tip of an iceberg that melted before I could get my fill. I managed to complete everything in around four or five hours  and that included all of the story missions, two side-quests, 20 collectibles, and handful of challenges. Its definitely time well-spent, though, and the excellent humor that had me chuckling frequently. Theres plenty of pop-culture nods, and Insomniac isnt afraid to point out after a Psycho-themed sidequest that, The saddest part about that whole thing is, most people under 30 wont get the reference.', 'For all the laughs however, the story barely has enough time to lay itself out before its all over, and the main objective of the story-based DLC ended so suddenly I wondered if Id missed the punchline. Thankfully, the story culminates with a decent final boss fight that lets you switch up your tactics, and incorporates your buddy Bryllcream in an ingenious fashion.', '\n', 'Youre rewarded for the quick romp with two new guns and amps that prove useful both on the oil rig and back in the main map, as well as the ability to use your new water traversal methods back in Sunset City.']",IGN

Arnos adventure in the dark and sometimes disorienting catacombs beneath Franciade changes up the established AC formula and provides some excellent opportunities for stealth, though Ubisoft once again fails to prop it up with a solid narrative.', ""What most surprised me about this first DLC pack (other than its apologetic price tag of $0) is the sheer size of it. I'm not only referring to the scope and scale of the new city of Franciade (modern-day Saint-Denis), but also to how densely packed its streets, rooftops, graveyards, and catacombs are with new missions, activities, and collectibles."", '\n', ""While the new location itself is large - easily one-fourth the size of Ubisoft's Paris and bigger than the starting area of Versailles - the above-ground sections don't feel all that different from the areas that we left behind in Paris. Arno will still shove his way through the same crowds of repeated NPCs (that occasionally float over one another) and clamber over similar rooftops, so the only thing that separates these streets from those in Paris are the permanently overcast skies and a haunting layer of fog that blankets the city. It provides an interesting new aesthetic, but I was glad to see the familiar setting disappeared almost entirely once I descended into the labyrinthine tunnels that make up two of Franciade's five districts."", ""Exploring the maze-like crypts and catacombs of Dead Kings is, at least at first, both entertaining and a refreshing spin on Unity's gameplay. These subterranean areas are much larger than I expected, and the tight, narrow passageways that give way to huge underground caverns help create a genuinely tense feeling of never knowing whats around the next corner. Couple that with some of the simple-yet-satisfying puzzles found underground, and I half-expected Arno to don a whip and fedora and start grumbling about Atlantis."", 'However, some of the winding corridors and overlapping pathways of this decidedly unique setting make it a bit too easy to get lost in the darkness, even when using map waypoints. After finding myself hopelessly lost for the fourth or fifth time, I realized that I had no desire to return to the underworld of Franciade after completing the main story missions (aside from my borderline compulsive need to collect everything).', '\n', 'The story certainly didnt give me a reason to replay the new missions. Dead Kingss plot spends its roughly two hours focused on Arno retrieving an artifact from deep within the tombs beneath Saint-Denis for the Marquis de Sade, but this simple heist becomes much too complicated much too quickly. Former allies become enemies with hardly any explanation, supernatural forces appear, and Arno even has his very own annoying Robin-style kid sidekick. It almost feels like four or five different storylines were shoehorned into one.', ""Even so, these story missions provide some of the best stealth segments in recent Assassins Creed history, due in large part to the addition of a new enemy Raider faction. These treasure hunters for hire are individually weak, but only appear in large groups. The only way to avoid fighting each and every Raider is to locate and assassinate the group leader (or spending hours painstakingly avoiding detection). A foreman's death will cause the rest of the group to panic and scatter, which allows you to freely explore each cave and cavern. Thats a great incentive that created several exciting cat-and-mouse moments in almost every mission."", '\n', ""Dead Kings also whips up some new equipment for your Assassin's arsenal, and they feel specifically engineered to deal with these new threats. Items like the Guillotine Gun, with all the functionality of an axe duct-taped to a grenade launcher, provide fun and unique (and loud) solutions to the new combat scenarios. I'll admit that as a stealth-minded player I found it essentially useless while sneaking, but I can't deny the satisfying feeling of sending a whole group of flaming Raiders soaring through the air with one well-placed mortar bomb."", ""Unfortunately, Dead Kings also introduces a refillable lantern which, outside of serving as an obscure plot device, is overused as a tool for navigating and unlocking many sections of the underground passages. While the use of fire and light adds a few clever puzzles to later missions, I couldn't help but roll my eyes every time I had to pull out my lantern just to scare away a group of roaches so that I could climb to the next ledge."", '\n', ""On the upside, the three new surface districts are full of collectibles, as well as the side activities that were the most enjoyable aspects of Unity's original release. Murder Mysteries, Paris Stories (Franciade Stories?), and even an updated version of the Nostradamus Enigma puzzles put the best of Unity's open world back in the spotlight, easily adding a few extra hours of things to do. They also included three new Far Cry-esque Outpost missions, which are challenging and fun to stealth your way through - though they lack replayability after the first or second attempt.""]",IGN

To call it an expansion is generous, roughly equivalent to calling a moped a motorcycle. The dearth of completely new content for the price is only half of the problem here though; the other half is how recycled and tacked on nearly every element feels.', 'Lets get this right out of the way: the new raid, Crotas End, is the best, and perhaps only reason to purchase The Dark Below. Just as the Vault of Glass raid did for the core Destiny experience, Crotas End introduces objective-based gameplay thats more interesting and varied than anything else youll find in this add-on. Its an infuriating peek at the excellent game Destiny could be  provided that you have five friends with level 28 characters you can round up via text message or phone (seeing as there still isnt any raid matchmaking).', 'That inconvenience alone is frustrating enough, but its compounded by how little there is to do in The Dark Below aside from the new raid. I blazed through the three story missions and the one new strike in under two hours, and in that time, I saw barely anything substantial that I hadnt seen in Destiny before. A strong sensation of deja vu crept in as I tore through Earth and moon areas Ive visited and revisited countless times since Destinys initial launch. The strike mission felt particularly samey, lacking the extra challenge and sense of urgency that make the original group of strikes my go-to grinding activity.', 'Also disappointing is how The Dark Below fails to flesh out Destinys anemic story content. There was an opportunity here to take a more active approach to storytelling, but developer Bungie passes on it, opting to stick with expository dumps before and after missions to inform us why we should care about the things were about to shoot. It didnt work for the core game, and it doesnt work here either. In the time its taken me to write this much, Ive already forgotten what I did or why I did it. Sure, its a new voice feeding us the story, but that doesnt make whats being said any more interesting.', 'That voice belongs to Eris, a new NPC standing around in the tower, handing out new bounties to pursue. Well, kind of new. Essentially, these are the same kill X number of Y tasks youve been doing, though they sometimes have minor twists, like a requirement to use a specific damage or weapon type. The main reason to do these is to increase your faction standing with Eris in order to purchase new cosmetic items and...thats about it. Shell toss you a new weapon every now and again, but for the most part, she offers little more than meaningless stuff to grind for, and Destiny already had plenty of that.', 'In fact, theres even more of that meaninglessness in The Dark Below, thanks to the fact that the new raid gear you earn from Crotas End requires an entirely new resource to upgrade  a resource you can only earn by running the raid over and over and over. So yeah, you can use that fancy new gear you earned wherever you want, you arent going to progress with it. This narrows the experience even further for high-level players.', 'Of course, none of this changes that Destiny is still fundamentally sound in the mechanics department. The act of combat isnt any less enjoyable in The Dark Below, but its no more enjoyable either. Yeah, some Hive Knights will drop the same sword we played with for one mission in the original (which is a blast while it lasts), and you get a hoverbike that can do backflips in mid-air, but neither addition is supported by gameplay that makes them feel necessary or even useful.']",IGN

Far less frequent, but far more dramatic, were my shifts from marveling at the clever tandem-character puzzle-platforming (the gameplay equivalent of patting my head while rubbing my belly) to frustration at some iffy anti-gravity physics and disappointment at the plain presentation. But I always quickly shifted back to enjoying it, especially in the demanding two-player co-op levels.', ""While Kalimba's minimal visual style, scarce soundtrack, and mostly-forgettable dialogue are all a bit basic, simplicity is molded into something special when it comes to the puzzle-platforming level design. In single-player, it's all about guiding my totem pieces through obstacle-course levels; if either piece touches a liquid that isn't their color or an enemy (provided you're not larger than one), both pieces die and are sent back to a generously placed checkpoint. While overcoming obstacles usually requires stacking the two and switching their placement (which happens instantly at the touch of a button), certain sequences require using obstacles in the level to put space between your pieces and being carefully aware of their movement. Throughout my five-hour single-player journey, there were enough tweaks to the formula that I felt challenged and interested in what new ideas the next level would add. Whether I was flying through the air via trampolines and cannons, or experimenting with elements that mess with the normally parallel movement and make one of the characters larger or stationary, most of the additions to Kalimba's solid platforming and puzzle mechanics are welcome."", ""The only parts I wasn't fond of were those that relied heavily on puzzles where gravity is reversed for one of the totems, causing the one on top to walk on the ceiling, and the way they bounce off each other meant dealing with very touchy physics. When I got a top score for finishing a level without dying and collecting all 70 items stashed within, I felt a sense of pride few games have given to me lately. Typically, when I made a mistake near the end that ruined such a run I'd curse, but there was an undercurrent of happiness  a feeling that I was just a retry away from attaining perfection. However, when a slightly mistimed anti-gravity move shot a totem into an obstacle, the lack of control in these situations led to more anger and less motivation to return to a level."", ""Those arent too frequent, though, and it's to Kalimba's credit that Ive felt an urge to return to its world since completing the campaign, thanks to a multitude of additional modes. I've made a few valiant-yet-ill-fated attempts to conquer Old School mode, where high scoring runs are the only way to add to a very limited supply of lives. Kalimba's co-op campaign, where each player controls a pair of totems of one color through specifically-designed levels, is an additional treat that taxed my brain in a whole new way: I had to verbalize solutions to a partner and sometimes synchronize movement to a degree that illustrates why Kalimba's co-op is strictly local."", ""Im eagerly awaiting completion of co-op to unlock Shorthanded mode, where I'll have to control both of the co-op totem pairs on a single controller (it reminds me of the underappreciated PS2 puzzler Cookies and Cream). Unfortunately, some of that sense of progress was stymied by a bug that erased more than half of my single-player progress and some of my co-op work when I was switching between apps. The publisher has stated that this will be fixed in time for launch, but I havent been able to verify that fix yet.""]",IGN

Its a short endless runner that only begins to pick up speed by the time it ends, has a very confusing story, mostly dull level design and, strangest of all, boring music.', 'A few short text blurbs set up the vague plot: Zeus, who in this reality is a big fan of funk but not so much other music, assigns his son Perseus to fight and take down the titans of pop, rap, and rock. Its not clear why their music is bad  at one point a character admits that pop music is really catchy  or why these other genres cant peacefully coexist. But okay, lets kill them.', 'Thats a silly, absurdist premise that mightve worked if properly developed... but Funk of Titans doesnt even seem to try. Aside from a few stone hands making rock on signs in the Rock world, the three worlds environments dont represent the genres theyre supposedly inhabited by at all. Instead, theres a stereotypical ancient Greece setting for pop, a bland frozen wasteland for rap, and a rocky underworld (but not that kind of rock) for rock. Inexplicably, the worlds dont even have background pop, rap, or rock music until you reach the boss. At least the cartoonish art style is pleasing, but only while youre zoomed out  cutscenes and close-up interactions with characters reveal ugly models with bizarrely misshapen limbs.', 'All of that is, of course, the icing on the mostly boring cake that is Funk of Titans gameplay. Most of the first 26 of its 39 platformer levels are too easy to be a challenge for even young gamers. This is a simplistic endless runner  its just A to jump and X to attack anything in the way. Thats fine if theres an interesting series of obstacles to avoid, but there are shockingly few, and only three enemy types. Platforming through these levels virtually uncontested isnt fun or satisfying. Only the final worlds 13 levels feature many new obstacles and objects, such as levers, cannons, and elevators. Where was all this stuff for the first two snooze-worthy worlds?', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', 'Boss levels are even worse. Their biggest highlight is that I finally got to hear a bit of the music Zeus is trying to eliminate, and the bosses themselves are trippy (like the rock-themed centaur) but thats about it.

To level Perseus up, I needed to complete Zeus Heroic Missions, which werent really all that heroic. For the most part they completed themselves, since many objectives were things like Jump 75 times. Leveling didnt seem very important either, as it only unlocks items in the shops. Most are purely cosmetic helmets, though a few are required to complete Heroic Missions. The weapons are also mostly cosmetic, but a select few will break special barriers that block the way to the special minigame item found in levels, the Pegasus.

Every skill I chose mattered, both in opening up new story paths and easing my day-to-day struggle against the forces of nature, which added welcome weightiness to my initial build choices. But unlike the Hardcore modes of similarly themed games like Metro: Last Light and Fallout: New Vegas, sheer survival was nearly always my primary concern, as opposed to combat or questing.', 'Scavenging buildings and the open wilderness for essentials, carrying containers, warm clothes, and useful tools introduced me to further peril, like diseased cultists, werewolf-like Dogmen, and other folklore-inspired enemies. The turn-based combat is brutally realistic, in that everything has deadly consequences. Even minor scrapes earned in a scrap with a cowardly, drug-addled looter could become infected and end my lifepermanently, as NEO Scavenger has only one save file and no option to reload from an earlier state. A high-level character with night vision goggles and a sniper rifle need only sip from a stream without boiling the water, and he may well be dead of gastroenteritis in days. Disinfectants and bandages are just as valuable to a combat build as ammo and sharp objects.', '\n', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'While these mechanics add texture and believability to the world to a degree no other survival game Ive ventured into ever has, they also work to the detriment of the surprisingly deep and involved story.

This intrepid reviewer had to pore over wikis and advice threads from the early access build to get anywhere near the right strategies. And Ill admit, that can be fun. Its the sort of non-user-friendly sadism that forces community interaction and collaboration in games like Dont Starve, Dwarf Fortress, or Crusader Kings II. Seeking out help from those who have been demolished over and over before me was part of the game itself.', 'Still, there comes a certain point where the process of stopping to build a campfire and boil eight bottles of water every other day just so I could make it to the next bit of story became a chore. The survival game and the mystery/thriller RPG really shine on their own merits, but they often dont mesh to provide a smoothly-flowing, enjoyable experience. Especially when Ive done the Bear Grylls thing for several hours and made it to a new story dungeon, only to be insta-killed and forced to start all over because I chose the wrong option in a dialogue screen.', 'The interface also leaves something to be desired. Everything from looting to crafting to combat uses a drag-and-drop system in which items, skills, and actions are slotted into an outcome box to produce different results.

Unfortunately, too much of Loadout weighed on me. When I didn't spend real money, the experience was too oppressive. When I started playing with money, there were still some unforgivable issues in the way matches are set up."", ""As far as third-person shooters go, Loadout is decent in terms of gameplay. Character movement is floatier than most shooters, but I got used to the pace within a few matches. The speediness of the combat was the bigger challenge to acclimate to; scopes are nearly useless, and headshots are a rarity. I did appreciate the abundance of arcade-inspired damage indicators, though  between giant glowing numbers and loud chimes, I always knew when I'd hit my mark."", 'There are both a co-op PvE campaign and PvP competitive matches in Loadout (both are always team-based and max out at four on four). The campaign and its bare-minimum backstory is a series of 50-plus matches against an AI-controlled aliens, each carrying stipulations given by unseen characters. A military commander will need help with enemies twice as strong as usual, an arms dealer will want some kills with a certain weapon, or a director may want a few headshots for gory movie footage. A simple character portrait would have done wonders to give them personality, but all we get are a few sentences of mission-select screen text.', ""Fortunately, the guns got me excited for battles when the mission setup didn't. The weapon-crafting system is insane, as each weapon type has at least seven customizable parts, from the trigger to the scope. I was able to make some pretty powerful and fun weapons, though there's some trial and error involved. For every hit, like my full-auto Tesla beam that spreads through groups of enemies, I'd usually find another that looked good statistically and performed decently during target practice but fell flat in combat. Even with the duds, I enjoyed tinkering with my guns."", ""I can't say the same for Loadout's attempt to infuse its characters with personality. Theyre are actually more fun dead than alive - getting limbs shot off or faces removed (leaving an eyes-only visage reminiscent of Assassin's Creed Unity's launch glitches) is fine, and the overwrought death animations are better than motionless fatalities. They're also better when you earn a rare costume item instead of buying into the glut of high-priced tchochkes. Fortunately, I wasn't enticed to spend, since much of Loadout's customizable items trade in crude humor. For some folks, giving the busty, big-boned Helga character the Fattoo skin, thong underwear, and a twerking taunt might elicit a chuckle, but it just came across as trying too hard to be outrageous."", 'The bigger issue is that while the campaign match types are completely randomized, stipulations aren\'t matched to complementary modes. In many cases, that led to stipulations completely incongruous to a match. A level with a stipulation asking for a number of rocket kills would be perfect for a ""find and capture randomized points"" mode, but usually I\'d get thrown into something completely different at first like Death Snatch, where the Kill Confirmed-style rules wouldn\'t allow me to fire up-close rockets at enemies. Theres no option to repeat a match type, either, so a lot of the campaign\'s strategy is ""wait until a compatible match pops up.""', 'Since progression through the campaign requires both a victory in battle and completing the personal objectives, I had many frustrating experiences of letting my team down while just eking out an ultimately meaningless objective, or setting aside my personal gain for the team, knowing another long match laid ahead with the same stipulations. That isnt a fun decision to make.', ""While Loadout isn't impossible to play free, I did have to do an insane amount of prepping and micromanaging to stand a chance without paying. Apropos to its name, there's only a single loadout to manage when you start, and while that may have been beneficial to learning the ins and outs of weaponcrafting, the prohibitive cost of purchasing a second slot made for awkward rounds where I brought the wrong weapons to battle and had to debate between ditching my team or spending the next 10 minutes with a losing strategy."", 'When I did start investing even a modicum of real-world money into Loadout, the results were pretty shocking in the campaign. I went from barely winning missions, maintaining a K:D ratio of 1.5:1 and rarely earning match MVP awards, to a team-carrying monster with double-digit killstreaks. In a way, I preferred the free experience  while it was much more of a grind early on, I feel way more accomplishment with a hard-fought victory than I do rolling over the opposition. Even when spending, I was often frustrated by missions requiring a certain ammo type that I ended up purchasing, only to reward me with a bounty of said ammo type.', 'When it came to the PvP multiplayer, it was nice to see that the equalized levels made money less important, and limited the pay-to-win feel to the co-op corner. However, outside of the more robust choices available when playing an invite-only match, the standard public matches are sparse when it comes to options, putting the mode to a vote and randomizing everything else. The underappreciated ""Jackhammer"" mode, where one team defends a giant crane while the other attacks it, almost never wins public vote, and I wish there was a way to find a match besides corralling friends.']",IGN

This drastically streamlines the entire flow of the game and keeps the frustration to a minimum.', 'Once you get the hang of it all, its easy to adjust your Ego  essentially the difficulty level  from 0 (easy) all the way up to 99 (impossible), which made me feel like I was constantly pushing myself to improve my skills. Furthermore, when playing local multiplayer, each player can adjust their Ego independently, basically acting as a handicap that allows you to play with anybody, regardless of skill level.', 'Character models, however, look like they came from a Wii Sports game, and their limited customization options mean you can expect to see slight variations of the same faces over and over.

The menus are generic, the cut scene animations are repetitive, and the music is grating, which makes it more suitable for short game sessions.', '', '', '', '', '', 'Outside of the standard exhibition mode (which allows up to four-player couch co-op), the only other way you can play Super Mega Baseball is season mode, which has a surprising level of depth.

A collection of tutorial videos shows how to play and a glossary defines the rules, but an interactive tutorial wouldve been much handier in understanding the nuances of gameplay and the differences between the four playable characters: Geralt, the Witchers eponymous monster-slayer; Triss Merigold, the sorceress; Yarpen Zigrin, the dwarven warrior; and Dandelion, the roguish bard. While it supports up to four players in online play, the great news is that it also allows CPU-controlled opponents to fill out the extra spots online or offline - a much-needed feature for when the number of online players is slim.', 'Theres not a lot of variety to gameplay, though. At the start of a match, each player selects their main quest from two randomly selected quest cards. (The winner is whoever is first to complete either one, three, or five main quests, depending on the setting selected.) Though theres some story flavor text outlining the main quest, and the optional support and side-quests, completing a main quest always comes down to having a set number of red, blue, or purple points and traveling to a particular city. These simplistic main quests tend to be interchangeable; all that differs is the city and the number and color of points.', 'Strategy lies in choosing how to accumulate points, whether by selecting to Investigate (drawing an investigation card may assign tasks, traits, combat scenarios, or bonuses/setbacks) or Develop (drawing a development card usually gives a card to augment your dice throws in combat). It feels more like youre playing alongside the other characters rather than truly against them, though. Most cards only negatively affect other players (and usually you as well) by luck of the draw rather than conscious effort, so winning a match becomes little more than a race to clear quests as quickly as possible. Admittedly, that could describe a bajillion other board games on the planet, but Id hoped that the competition in The Witcher Adventure Game would be as brutal as its namesake.', 'The digital version of The Witcher Adventure Game is strikingly faithful to the tabletop experience, which is admirable in a purist sort of way, but I was a bit disappointed that it doesnt leverage the medium to make the presentation more exciting. For example, when confronted by a monster at the end of a turn, the only monster you see is the one that appears as a drawing on the card, and there is no graphic depiction of your triumph or defeat at its claws. Click on the card and all that happens is a handful of dice drop across the screen, revealing your fate. The board itself does offer a few nice visual animations that you wont see in the tabletop version, though, like rain and snow effects, smoking chimneys, and rustling leaves.', 'The soundtrack, on the other hand, is appropriately stirring, conveying the epic fantasy gravitas of its setting. The grandiose dom-DOM that closes out each turn implies something big has just happened -- even when all you did was rest to heal your wounds. Given how long matches can go when four players are competing to win five quests (roughly two hours or more), the most frustrating thing about how faithful this adaptation is may be that you cant fast-forward through computerized players turns. No, you have to sit and wait while the computer thinks, draws cards, and throws dice. Some may enjoy seeing how each hero handles their turns, but I wouldve preferred an option to get on with it. I can do without the extra dom-DOMs.']",IGN
100,Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes,22-Dec-14,Mitch Dyer,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/22/metal-gear-solid-5-ground-zeroes-review-pc,"[""[Editor's Note: IGN reviewed Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes earlier this year. Because it's largely identical across PC and consoles, Lucy OBriens original review still applies and is summarized here in the verdict. This review focuses on the PC version's unique features.]"", 'Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes diverges from series conventions in numerous ways, most notably in its open-ended approach to stealth, and minor enhancements to the interface improve this on PC.', 'Ground Zeroes main mission, a rescue op to free two captured allies, isnt very long, but the vast compound in which its set allows for diverse play styles that are emphasized in smart, silly, and satisfying unlockable objectives.', 'IGNs original reviewer Lucy OBrien illustrated what makes Ground Zeroes a great stealth-action game. She explained, Ground Zeroes is so adept at generating tension that at times it felt like I was playing a survival horror game. While [main character Big Boss] has never been more flexible; able to roll and jump and shoot in line with todays top third-person action-adventure games, enemies are smart and plentiful. In the harsh light of day - and played on Hard mode - they possess cruel 20/20 vision, and react to every little movement or shifting shadow by becoming more efficacious in their patrolling.', 'On PC, this tension can be amplified by minimizing the HUD elements -- disabling visual notifications cleans up the screen, makes Ground Zeroes more challenging, and leaves more room to appreciate its commendable visual fidelity. It exceeds even the terrific graphics of the new-gen consoles on maximum settings; the rainy nighttime map is gorgeous, with slick roads reflecting the glaring lights of truck headlights, and characters clothing dripping in the storm. The daytime variant highlights different high-quality lighting effects, with immaculate environmental detail creating a convincing sense of place. I found myself reducing the screen-filtering effects to minimize the default, sometimes overbearing blur and depth of field, however; this caused the foreground to look too washed out, like the camera is way out of focus.', 'The frame rate is uncapped, but locking it at 30fps allowed for more reliable performance when cranking up the model, texture, and shadow detail on an older PC, but Ground Zeroes is stunning on a respectable rig -- I played mostly on a Core i5-4670 and a GTX 780, with 8GB RAM) -- with no need for compromise.', 'Keyboard and mouse controls work well with Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes, but a controller is slightly stronger for stealth precision. Its more similar to Splinter Cell: Blacklist than any other Metal Gear game, using an analog stick to measure walking speed has more precision, but its adequate using WASD and customizable, all of which can be set to your preference.', 'The PC version is content-identical to the console versions, which means Ground Zeroes ending remains tonally problematic, with a tone-deaf and brash representation of violence thats never earned. It attempts to hit a darker point for the series, but its discomforting violation is misguided, gross, and hopefully a one-time thing.']",IGN
101,Sunset Overdrive,27-Oct-14,Marty Sliva,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/27/sunset-overdrive-review,"[""Sunset Overdrive has ruined my attention span, and honestly, I wouldn't have it any other way. During my 30-hour trip through developer Insomniac's insane but endearing depiction of the apocalypse, I strayed off the beaten path more than I have in any other open-world game in recent memory. Despite the mini-map encouraging me to head 400 meters east, I couldn't help but veer off the route at every opportunity."", ""This isn't due to a lack of interesting things to do, but rather a testament to the abundance of them. Because of Sunset's superb traversal, impeccable comedic writing, and wealth of upgrade paths for my character and weapons, I was more than happy to take the road less traveled. More often than not, it led me someplace that I'm thoroughly glad I visited."", 'Sunset Overdrive visually pops, like the Easter Bunny on an acid trip. Its bright colors, punk-rock attitude, and nose turned up in the direction of authority all meld together wonderfully. Like the cult-classic Jet Set Radio, Sunset assaulted my senses with a never-ending barrage of stimulus. Monsters explode into an ocean of bright-orange viscera, certain weapons allow you fire off a torrent of blazing fireworks, and freezing enemies will result in the word BRRRR appearing in the air above them. I really appreciate that Insomniac has crafted a world that successfully adheres to a strong, unique, and artistic vision.', ""This distinct style transcends aesthetics, and actually aids in Sunset's most successful and often-used mechanics. Like most any open-world game, the mission structure here has you talking to a character at point A, making your way across the map to point B, and engaging in some activity that usually results in being sent to collect a reward at point C. While that structure might sound monotonous, Sunset makes the very act of traversal a constant joy instead of an obligatory trudge. I rarely found myself using the fast travel system, because this is a game thats about the journey as much as the destination."", 'Narrative conceit be damned, your hero or heroine can, using nothing but their own two feet, bounce off anything remotely buoyant, dash through the air, and grind on all manners of power lines, billboards, and anything that presents a right angle. In fact all of this is encouraged thanks to a punitively slow regular ground running speed, the rewards of a smart combo system, and an ridiculous abundance of monsters, soldiers, and robots. Seriously, if you find yourself on the ground for more than 10 seconds, deprived of your godly mobility, chances are youre going to end up dead shortly after that. But Sunset wisely avoids harsh punishments with quick respawns with amusing animations that lovingly pay homage - in clever ways - to dozens of classic works, from Portal to Terminator to Night of the Living Dead.', 'As long as you keep moving and refrain from lingering on the ground, Sunsets combat proves to be deep, entertaining, and rewarding. I loved fighting enemies like the giant Hurkers, as each encounter felt like a mini-boss fight in and of itself. Theres a great sense of tension in trying to stay moving while maintaining the high ground. And thanks to Sunsets deep and varied arsenal, I found myself creating some really interesting combos: Id start off by peppering the area with freeze bombs, which bought me enough time to lay down a field of Acid Sprinklers, and finish it all off with a cascade of exploding teddy bears.', '\n', ""While all of that looks and feels awesome in motion, it definitely isnt easy. The controls in Sunset aren't simple: by the time you gain a full suite of weapons and traversal abilities, your hands will be getting a serious workout trying to manage them all. But while it certainly felt cumbersome initially, leading to a stretch of hours where my fingers always felt just a fraction of a second behind where my mind was, I eventually acclimated to the complex system and even grew to appreciate it."", 'For sure, by the end of the campaign, I still found myself having to work to navigate this hand-eye-coordination spaghetti bowl when I had to grind on a wire, kill a horde of monsters below me, hop off, switch weapons and kill an airborne bat-thingy, and air dash towards the nearest bounding so I could wall-ride around its outside. But while it might be a bit complicated, the result of mastering the system and eventually being able to make it across the entirety of the city without ever setting foot on the pavement is wildly satisfying.', 'That prior example of insanity is just one of hundreds that I remember fondly. I love telling other people my stories about my time in Sunset Overdrive, because they seem to be just that: my stories. If I wanted to put on a wolf mask and fire off explosive teddy bears at a group of robots, I could do just that. Sunset treats its open world as a canvas for you to express yourself aesthetically, through movement, and of course, through combat.', '\n', 'It also felt personalized by the fact that weapons and abilities are upgraded based on how often you use them. The more I bounced across the city, the more opportunities I had to add an explosion to my jumps. Everytime I killed a robot with an Acid Sprinkler, I inched closer to upgrading both my weapon, as well as my skills against robots. Not only does it reward your playstyle, but it also encouraged me to experiment with other weapons in order to see how theyd evolve over time.', 'Combat reaches new levels of insanity when you hop into Chaos Squad, Sunset Overdrives eight-player cooperative multiplayer missions. These unfold as wave-based siege defenses where youre given a brief amount of time to lay traps and coordinate with your buddies before all hell breaks loose. The ensuing spectacle of blood, guts, lightning, ice, lasers, and giant fireworks is insanity of the highest caliber. But while Chaos Squad is a neat diversion, it didnt grab me quite as tightly as the single-player campaign managed to.', 'Weaving in and out of this self-expression is also one of most consistently funny scripts in recent memory. From pop culture deep cuts to fourth-wall-breaking remarks about the nature of video games, I found myself genuinely laughing at Sunset Overdrive throughout the entire campaign. The voice work is great, the supporting cast is varied and interesting (spend 30 seconds with the robot dog and its tough not to fall in love), and I found myself weirdly obsessed with uncovering the events that led to this apocalypse.']",IGN
102,Scrolls,22-Dec-14,Brandin Tyrrel,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/22/scrolls-review,"['In a thriving field of collectible card games, Scrolls proves there are still opportunities for original twists on the familiar formula. Its a fine example of a creative merging of genres, grafting together the unlikely duo of cards (dubbed scrolls, in this case), with turn-based tactical combat. With a battlefield full of hard-fighting creatures and a library bursting with powerful spells and enchantments, building your arsenal in deck form and commanding those forces in combat has produced one of the more unique experiences  one that really gets going once you begin to dabble in higher-level play.', 'The goal of Scrolls combat is to whittle down and destroy three of your opponents five small idol statues that sit at their end of the boards five rows, while defending your own. This adds an excellent cerebral element to the typical card combat: you decide which rows have to stand strong, and which ones can be sacrificed. And because all your actions must be performed on your turn -- there are no instant spells -- you really have to plan for every possible outcome in advance, both in immediate creature movements and your overall strategy.', 'But Scrolls most interesting mechanic is the way you generate resources to play your scrolls. Every turn you can choose to sacrifice a scroll in your hand to add another resource to your pool, or sacrifice a scroll to pull two new scrolls from the top of your deck. It not only creates tough choices when you have a hand full of great scrolls but lack the resources to play them, but it keeps things moving in a way that you never feel like youre waiting a half-dozen turns to pull a scroll you need. Youre always able to make an unneeded scroll work for you, even if its simply to sacrifice it.', 'With so many options to consider both when moving your characters in combat, and crunching the probabilities of whats coming up in your deck, Scrolls weakest element is that matches can slow to a crawl. Against the smart AI or a good player whos familiar with their deck, your deck, and the state of the board, rounds unfold at a decent pace. But for unseasoned players who are still grasping all the potential outcomes, each turn can take the full 90 seconds allowed, dragging matches out for what feels like forever.', 'There are plenty of those folks, because despite its many tutorials and Trial matches designed to get you acquainted with the rules, Scrolls isnt very accessible for new players. For example, though there are ways to look at all 360 of the current collectible scrolls, like filtering the player-to-player scrolls shop to see which scrolls you dont have, it would be nice to have a dedicated area to look at your collection and easily see whats missing. Its hard to even know which of the four distinct factions you want to play-- Growth, Order, Energy, and Decay -- or what kind of deck you want to build, without first doing research in Scrolls companion site.', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'On the other hand, the bulk of Scrolls progression system is tied to purchasing these scrolls with earned in-game gold, which is surprisingly generous. Each victory against online players, the AI, or in the daily Trials, nets you considerable gold to be spent on random packs of 10 scrolls, random singular scrolls from a particular faction, or completely preconstructed decks to buff out your collection. And though Scrolls gifts you starter decks for each faction, youll earn enough gold to unlock new scrolls and decks a decent pace. The optional premium currency is just that  more optional than ever  and I can easily see how you could collect everything before too long without spending another cent.', 'Since Scrolls purchase options are mostly random, Mojang wisely included a Black Market that allows you to purchase scrolls sold directly from other players, often undercutting the prices in the traditional store. Its a great tool for snagging that one scroll you need without spending thousands of gold hoping to get lucky with a random pack. Alternatively you could strike up a trade with a member of Scrolls growing community, which already boasts hundreds of players online at any given time.', 'That community is actually one of Scrolls strengths. Not only is it populated with a knowledgeable, helpful, brutally good group of players, youre also able to spectate anyones match to get a glimpse of high-level play, new strategies, and whats waiting for you in ranked and Judgement matches. Its a great resource for newcomers, especially since Scrolls doesnt explain some of the finer parts, like how to tell a common scroll from an uncommon or rare just by looking at it.', 'Judgement is Scrolls version of an arena tournament. Youll buy in with a hefty amount of gold, construct the best deck possible from randomly drawn scrolls, and go to work notching up wins and earning better rewards against other players Judgement decks until your second loss knocks you out. Its a familiar feature but a welcome addition, both as a way to earn the best scrolls, and to mix things up from casual online matches or the fiercely competitive ranked play with pre-built decks.']",IGN
103,Dead State,18-Dec-14,Richard Cobbett,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/18/dead-state-review,"['Like most of the best zombie fiction, Dead State is an old-lkschool RPG thats no more about its zombies than a disaster movie is about the asteroid impact, tsunami, or earthquake. The event is important; theyve changed everything. But its the people that the story is about, and especially the small group that youre in charge of, all huddled in your little scrap of safety. Its your job to feed and protect them by heading out in search of supplies and other survivors, but also to keep them sane and safe and away from each others throats while back at home. The result is a clever, if undeniably clunky mix of both genres and past zombie games weve seen that is absolutely going to be some peoples favourite of the year... but also one that, like a brain-hungry zombie trying to chomp down on Stephen Hawking, bites off more than it can chew.', '\n', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'The bulk of Dead State takes place in two phases, not entirely unlike a combination of Fallout and X-COM - RPG-style journeys into a world of zombies and tooled-up survivors for the food and weapons you need, and a management layer where you worry about building fences and rationing supplies and dealing with everyones problems. One character, for instance, starts out suicidal and has to be talked back over the course of several conversations, while food and fuel and morale ebb and flow on a daily basis. Should a teammate be bitten (your character is immune) then you need antibiotics to hold off the infection, or theyll become zombified and have to be put down. It doesnt matter if theyre your only medic, or your best fighter - theyre gone forever. Conversely, fail to keep up morale and confidence and they might ultimately relieve you of command. With a bullet.', 'This part really shows Dead State at its best, due to being able to focus on plot and character and simple decisions with interesting repercussions. A big board lets you assign tasks each morning, from building structures like a watchtower or well, to crafting guns and chemicals, to cleaning up or teaching a non-English speaker enough to get by. Each of the characters is superbly written with very strong personalities, from a mother and daughter team who desperately want to keep the other out of harm, to Doug, a nerd discovering that a zombie apocalypse isnt as awesome as he always thought.', 'The more survivors join the group, the more the political side comes into play: crisis decisions must be made, impromptu interruptions like a party member getting sick and asking for the day off, different ideas on what the group should focus on, and being the final arbiter of on things like whether, for instance, the creepy zombie-killing obsessive should be kicked out or put to use. If things get really bad, you also unlock the option to deal with troublemakers by gunning them down personally.', 'All this is great stuff, even with a few annoying issues like characters just rehashing the same dialogue when not actively coming to you, some mornings consisting of a conga-line of people demanding decisions, and the same person occasionally returning just to go from I just wanted to tell you youre great to By the way, you suck and youll kill us all. This is just one of many glitches and rough edges that alternately amuse and irritate, with a highlight being the combat descriptors often leading to zombies with labels like Dead Man - Almost Dead.', 'The catch is the work between these bits can be a real chores. Inventory management shouldnt be a bigger headache than filling the stock cupboard, and not just because Dead States UI practically defines clunky, slow and bloody awful. And its an odd survival game where the big quandary of the day soon goes from How do we eat tonight? but Who gets first dibs on the deodorant? Yet its all for nothing, basically - while its possible to lose due to poor management, it takes so long and the world is so conveniently bursting with supplies that its actually pretty difficult to do unless you literally do nothing for day after day after day.', 'By far the biggest chore, though, tends to be what should be the most interesting: heading out into the zombie-infested world. Again, it plays much like the original Fallout, complete with random encounters, a map that slowly unfolds as your ability to explore increases, and turn-based tactical combat  but unlike Fallouts world, this is an incredibly bland one, with little personality and an oddly lacking sense of danger. Zombies just stand around the map unless triggered by sound, making the sensible way of defeating them just picking them off one or two at a time until you get to the point where theyre irrelevant. Humans are far bigger threats due to their guns, but no more mobile, and so usually just as easily avoided until youre ready. Even early on its rare to feel in trouble unless forced into a fight, though it is possible to get swamped if things get noisy.', 'Another big distinction from Fallout is that fighting anyone, alive or dead, is a miserable experience. The turn-based combat doesnt offer even the most basic tactical features like overwatch or interesting terrain elements to position your party around, turning each encounter into a slow-paced exercise in trading blows. Indoor locations are far too cramped, outside ones typically too empty. Characters action-point allocations too are rarely generous enough to do anything with except take a couple of swings or run for it. Glitches are in full force here too  from smashing a door occasionally being treated as beating up a neutral human, to it making no distinction between neutral and hostile Looters until they open fire. In both of these cases of course, youre treated as if you beat up a puppy for fun.', 'The result of all this is that essential scavenging soon becomes a very tedious, map-scouring chore. It is, however, regularly uplifted by occasional bursts of story in the field, with writing just as solid as that in the safehouse. Instances like the man in a restaurant who waits for you to offer shelter before springing the fact that he also has an elderly woman and a young boy who would like to take up that most generous offer create interesting dilemmas. These moments are rare enough to feel special, but common enough that entering a new location always has potential.', 'This really is Dead States best trick; being able to combine both its halves in a way that the overall experience compensates for many of their flaws - that even dull scavenging still has an impact on the big picture, while the growth of your base means that at least youre heading out with your own tools and chosen people to get things done and unlock the story. If you can get into the rhythm it wants, it works. As soon as things slip though, just for a moment, that magic fades and youre left with lots of individual elements that are all great ideas, undercooked - a world of flat atmosphere and weak combat where survival just isnt a big or exciting enough problem to justify the amount of time it takes to ensure.']",IGN

It's also one of the most boring. It's both. I've spent weeks waiting for the moment that something would click and I'd understand how to play Elite in a way that was consistently enjoyable and engaging, but that moment hasnt come yet. Though my understanding and enjoyment increased with greater experience, that cycle of brief, intense emotional peaks and long, shallow valleys of boredom never changed. It is fundamental to Elite's identity."", 'Elite encapsulated itself during one of my most recent sorties. I was doing ""one last flight"" before bed when I spotted a lucrative contract for a cargo run to Jordan Stop, a semi-legal mining outpost in the the absolute middle of nowhere. The space station is roughly 250,000 light-seconds away from the main star in its solar system, and even at faster-than-light speeds, it\'s a long, boring flight to get out there. There are no stars anywhere nearby, nor any other planets or asteroid belts. Places like Jordan Stop are why I\'ve started keeping a book within reach when I play Elite, and have had to start making new music playlists just to keep things fresh.', ""Why do I keep going back to Jordan Stop? It has some of the absolute rock-bottom prices for metals and minerals in Elites massive galaxy. It also does a brisk trade in gray-market and black-market goods, and there are never any cops around to scan your cargo and raise a stink. It's also largely ignored by other players, who tend to cluster along more popular trade lanes and ambush unwary travellers. I can take some scavenged illegal goods out to Jordan Stop and sell them for pure profit, and then pick up a load of precious metals and take it back to a wealthier, more central system and turn my small pile of money into a huge one. All without worrying too much about getting chain-harassed by griefing pirates."", ""This is my life as a small businessman and part-time smuggler in Elite. Sometimes I question why I'm playing something that sometimes feels remarkably like shift-work at a particularly boring store or factory. Yet I still come back, and still take satisfaction in striking a good deal, even though the only things to spend money on are bigger ships and weapons that let me do even more of the exact same kind of work."", '\n', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', ""On this trip, though, my increasingly sullen reverie was shattered about 50 light-seconds from Jordan Stop.

I didn't know how long I'd been stalked through this deserted stretch of extra-nothingness, but another pilot had come up behind me and hooked me like a fish."", 'I was fighting with my spaceship, trying to escape the Interdictors hold  by pointing my nose oriented with the escape vector that would let me out of the trap. But after a minute of struggling against my stricken Adder, I noticed that I was about to slam into the nameless planet that Jordan Stop orbits, which suddenly loomed outside my cockpit window.', 'I gave up the fight and let the interdictor snap me out of frameshift before he could slam me into it and scavenge my cargo from the wreckage. But there was no time to rest: I hit the red stud on my flight stick and deployed my weapon hardpoints.', ""My ship - an Adder - is just okay. It's like a having a really sweet van in high school; not the flashiest thing around, but still fun to drive irresponsibly fast and you can get up to all kinds of mischief with it. It's not a dogfighter, and it fares especially poorly in the turning-duels that combat into which combat in Elite boils down to. But it's also not a beached whale of a spaceship like some of the long-range haulers are (though those are tough enough, thanks to their sheer size and turreted weapons). More importantly, however, is that mine is upgraded with a trio of weapons that collectively cost far more than the ship itself. It carries two beam lasers that sustain a high-power blast of energy for as as long as you hold down the trigger, and a single cannon that fires slow-moving but awesomely destructive kinetic slugs."", ""The pirate was right behind me, flying a speedier and more nimble Cobra.... but he'd taken too long to close the distance, and I brought my guns to bear. The beam lasers lanced out and converged on his ship, and a few seconds later his shields flickered out. A snap-shot with the cannon blasted into his hull as he flew past. He was badly wounded and maneuvering poorly, realizing that suddenly this was no longer a dogfight. It was a slugging match, and I had the brass knuckles."", ""A few minutes later, as I watched my beam lasers carve through the pirate's hull, leaving a superheated streak of molten metal over the power core that began to widen as the ship breaks apart, I had an enormous, evil, Grinch-like smile on my face... but it soon faded as I returned to the drudgery of the cargo haul."", ""That's Elite. Elite is that long, boring drive through an empty interstellar highway, fiddling with the radio to find something that will help keep you awake. And then, for a few minutes, Elite yanks you out of your chair and into a cockpit of a stricken starship, with nobody around to rescue you and scant seconds to prepare for the fight of your life."", ""As I've become more flexible with my approach to Elite, I've been rewarded by the sheer variety of things itll throw in my path when I'm willing to stop and smell the hydrogen. Some speculative cargo-hauling leads me to an unexplored star system, which leads me to some freelance cartography. But while I'm taking navigation readings that I'll be able to sell later  and enjoying the stunning scenery of space that Elite capture better than any other game I've seen  Ill spot a highly-rated pilot with a fat bounty on her head. Then I'll spend a few minutes chasing her around the solar system, trying to get within interdiction range so I can force her into a fight and collect the bounty. Or I can do the same thing to another trader, and engage in some piracy (though the moment you attack another pilot, even with a stray shot in the middle of a battle, you get a bounty on your head). Later, I might find sketchy contraband adrift in space near the wreckage of a cargo vessel, and have to decide whether I feel like taking the risk to do some smuggling, or if I should just get on with my legal business."", ""It's easy to spend a lot of pleasant time aimlessly wandering and fighting because it does such a tremendous job of making each ship feel distinctive, and immersing you in the role of the pilot. I absolutely love that I can also control my ship through the in-game displays and control panels instead of memorizing countless keyboard shortcuts. My desk, monitor, keyboard, and flight stick all of that kind of disappear, and my awareness is largely confined to the game itself."", ""Frontier has also done a tremendous job with peripheral support. I played with a joystick and throttle, and was amply rewarded for it, though it handles fine with an Xbox controller or even the mouse. Likewise, my TrackIR head-tracker worked perfectly the first time I launched (and actually makes it really easy to utilize that cockpit interface to its best potential). I'd actually recommend having a flight stick and throttle for this game, especially if you're going to turn off flight assist to execute real zero-G combat maneuvers like rotating your ship (and guns) while still traveling in a straight line."", ""Yet for all the freedom in Elite and the superb graphics and sound, I still find it a little too barren of character and flavor in this world. News bulletins tell me that the Federation is teetering as its productive colonies secede rather than pay taxes to a decadent and exhausted core.... but that's just words on a page. You won't meet anyone with an opinion on this brewing civil war, or receive a mission that somehow gets you involved in the fate of a star system. The Federation forces seem interchangeable with local police forces, which are almost indistinguishable from the navy of the Autocracy."", '-', ""I haven't had any mission chains that give me a taste of what's going on in the fiction of Elite. Each mission ends with a dry summary explaining that you've helped one faction or hurt another, and as a result a given star system is marginally richer or more chaotic than it was before. Not that you'll notice as you travel to one of three main types of space station and see the exact same variety of ships doing the exact same thing as they were at the place you just left. Conflict zones wait patiently for players to come and engage in a giant furball, but often times there doesn't seem to be any kind of fight happening at all. Elite has an enormous open world, but still not a terribly interesting or dynamic one."", ""The risk of boredom, of nothing interesting happening, has always been a risk that the simulation genre runs. But considering that Elite is science fiction, rather than simulating something from history, or trying to bring the daily life of a farm worker to your PC, there's no good reason it should feel so much like punching-in and punching-out of the daily grind. When it breaks up the routine, and throws me into something completely unexpected, I'm almost willing to forgive Elite for all the hours where it just has me flying in a long, straight line between Point A and Point B."", 'Almost.']",IGN

This is a sequel that successfully ousts some of the more humdrum elements of its dark fantasy tactical RPG."", ""Blackguards 2 strips the series of a tad of its past freedom by not letting you create your own character, but the story's the better for it. The spotlight here falls on Cassia of Tenos, who's spent years in a dungeon crawling with giant spiders who bite her and fill her mind with literal and figurative poison. Blackguards 2 uses this period effectively (if a tad too slowly) to elicit sympathies for her growing madness and to explain the basics of leveling and combat. Ably voiced and mad for revenge, Cassia embarks on a fascinating if slightly predictable story."", ""Other than that, though, Cassia's a blank slate. Blackguards 2 doesn't push you toward three token classes like its predecessor; instead, you can build her, Skyrim-style, into whatever type of poison-riddled mad conqueror you wish to make. It helps that Daedaelic makes deciding on such progression easier than before by interpreting the Dark Eye ruleset on which Blackguard is based more liberally. The talent trees for melee, magic, and ranged skills are simplified here without losing much of their depth, for instance, and assigning ability points gained from winning battles is much more intuitive than before."", ""That's also true for the various companions she meets along the way, although they're somewhat more locked into their roles. Naurim the dwarf's my favorite - hes a visual Gimli clone who makes no secret of his greed and his disdain for others. Elsewhere there's Zurbaran the mage, his date-rapey days behind him as he sulks in his bonds, and Takate the glory-obsessed headhunter, who's laughably predictable but always good for an amusing retort."", ""Cassia's already a mess, so this is hardly the best crew for giving her advice in her quest for revenge, and it sometimes shows in the decisions she must make as her tale advances. For example, Cassia occasionally has to resort to her own methods of gaining intel by interrogating the prisoners the team brings back to camp. It sometimes gets as dark as it sounds. Hardly surprising, though, as this is a game with loading screens that sometimes feature a man getting disemboweled while another runs a sword across his neck."", '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', ""But the first game was full of all this Conan-meets-Game of Thrones gloom: Blackguards 2 distinguishes itself by letting the tale of Cassia's madness add a degree of uncertainty over the whole affair. Even then, the plots not as strong or as original as it probably could be, as it seems Daedalic spent most of its efforts on improving the combat."", ""That's a good thing. A turn-based game, Blackguards 2's action unfolds on a hexagonally gridded playing field, but with interactive elements such as doors and chests and impractically stacked crates that you can topple over to smoosh the bad guys. That's still true here, with the added benefit that Blackguards 2 allows substantially more freedom as to where you can place your heroes (such as they are) at the start of a fight."", ""But the one thing that makes Blackguards 2 significantly more enjoyable than its predecessor is the improved hit-and-miss ratio. Seriously, the dice roll system employed in the first game makes spells miss often enough that a Storm Trooper would roll his eyes in disgust. Here, praise the sun, almost all spells hit. Even better, they're complemented with fancy animations that make the top-tier abilities fun to look at. This doesn't make Blackguards 2 much easier (and a new stamina bar keeps melee spamming in check), but it has the welcome effect of allowing you to spend more time thinking about positioning rather than wondering if your point-blank spell or sword strike is even going to land."", ""It's also important because Blackguards 2 remains a relatively slow game, despite the speed boost from the improved hit ratio. Much of its roughly 20 hours involves the march of around 15 NPCs across large boards a handful of tiles at a time, and at one turn at a time. It gets boring, frankly, to the point that I found myself wishing I could skip over the enemy movements to keep the action going. Even small skirmishes can drag on for half an hour, and of course if you mess up you'll have to do the whole thing over again. And forget about saving during combat - it ain't happening."", ""This complicates the otherwise welcome introduction of a strategic world map overlay, which breaks up some of the linear progression by having Cassia and her main adversary battle for control of the towns she's already conquered along the way. It's a good system for the most part, as it attaches certain bonuses such as items or resources to particular towns, making the effort needed to hold onto them worthwhile. A mercenary system enriches it further, as you'll sometimes have to defend the town with them alone."", ""Over time, though, it becomes a drag. Too often I found myself just wanting to experience the main story quests instead of duking it out over a town I've already seen before, but on the defensive side. And again, battles can take forever. On the other hand, revisiting the old maps helped remind me of just how finely crafted the maps are, and how theyre geared toward specific scenarios. Each is a new surprise (and sometimes the perspective shifts to directly overhead), and stepping backwards to fight over familiar settings ruins some of that sense of discovery.""]",IGN
106,Craft the World,9-Jan-15,TJ Hafer,http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/09/craft-the-world-review,"['Establishing dwarven kingdoms, the primary endeavor before us in Craft the World, has become almost as much a time-honored tradition (or cliche, depending on your preference) in PC gaming as shooting zombies or looting dungeons. Though greeted by a charmingly-rendered, Terraria-style side-scrolling world with destructible terrain and open-ended objectives, my most pressing question for this subterranean kingdom-builder was what it could do for me that its predecessors and competitors cant. The answer, I found after quite a lot of digging, was not much.', '\n', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'I began with one plucky dwarf wielding a sharpened rock. The only edifice I could call my own was an immobile stockpile, to which I would bring the various building materials and foodstuffs I harvested from the generally cheerful, cartoonish environment. Concise tutorial pop-ups and a helpful quest journal left me with suggestions of what I should be doing next at any given time, though after a while they began to feel a bit too hand-holdy. As I harvested, crafted, and built up my meager proto-empire, I gained experience points for my settlement. Reaching a new level rewarded me with an extra dwarf and a handful of other rewards in the form of gear, materials, and crafting recipes. The ever-expanding legion of dwarves under my command would pick up tasks I had set in no particular order, and go about their business when they had run out of things to do.', 'Aside from leveling, the main path of progression is through a fairly extensive tech tree. Crafting a certain number of an item tied to a technology I already had (say, Woodworking) would unlock the technology immediately after it (such as better weaponry). This felt natural and intuitive, as I didnt have to worry about building anything just for arbitrary science points. Its like leveling up in an Elder Scrolls gameby actually using your skills, instead of assigning ranks after meeting experience thresholdsand I found myself wondering why more strategy games havent gone that route.', 'I settled into a mildly gratifying routine of harvesting during the day, fighting off waves of flimsy skeletons and zombies at night, and occasionally unlocking some new tech to expand or upgrade my burgeoning holdfast. The undead ended up being the least of my concerns, however, as the crafting interface became a much more aggravating nemesis. Items are crafted on a grid, not unlike in Minecraft, but the method for arranging recipes seems like it was designed for a touch interface. Even if I knew a recipe, I had to individually drag each of the materials to its spot on the grid. I couldnt even grab a stack of, say, wood, and place several pieces into the required arrangement. Every individual piece of every material has to be individually click-dragged. With the amount of crafting I had to do, and the complexity of some of the larger recipes, this quickly had me yanking at my own beard in irritation.', 'As my dwarves descended into the earth, I was filled with anticipation for the climactic moment in any story involving a subterranean kingdom. The moment when youve dug too greedily and too deep, and something emerges to punish your hubris. What I found was a few moderately difficult boss enemies and some rare ores, but nothing as dramatic or game-changing as I was hoping. There was no, By Moradin, run! moment. In fact, my greatest threat came from timed monster waves on the surface, which can largely be dealt with by building defensive towers and other traps.', 'Alongside the sandbox mode, Craft the World comes with a campaign of sorts. Unfortunately, it doesnt have much of a story, and the only objective is to survive long enough to craft a portal that will take you to a differently themed world... where you start over with a new base and must craft the portal again. The enemies, resources, and environments were interesting for a while on the icy and desert worlds that follow the green pastures where the campaign starts, but ultimately didnt change my gameplay in dramatic or interesting ways. Dwarves cant freeze to death in the frozen wastes or dry out and wither in the desert, so for the most part, it just felt like a palette swap.']",IGN
107,Guilty Gear Xrd Sign,16-Dec-14,Darry Husky,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/16/guilty-gear-xrd-sign-review,"['Shredding guitars, spiky hair, pirate girls riding flying dolphins, and a posterior-poking surgeon in a paper bag mask can mean only one thing: Guilty Gear Xrd -SIGN- is finally here. With Xrd (pronounced Ex Ard, and your guess is as good as mine), Guilty Gear takes a cue from Street Fighter 4 and Killer Instinct in pulling the series closer to its roots, and its incredibly unique characters and rich combat will test fight fans abilities in incredibly rewarding ways.', 'One of the most noticeable elements of Guilty Gear Xrd is its colorful, imaginative character design. Guilty Gear Xrds protagonists are a weird, interesting, and often amusing cast of misfits; a steady breath of fresh air compared to the karate guys and ninja gals that pad many fighting game rosters.', 'Each member of Guilty Gear Xrds roster is wholly distinct in their core mechanics and the way they are played. While Sol and Ky feel vaguely like Ken and Ryu, it is here that familiar ground begins to fade away, replaced by sheer insanity in the form of projectiles from all angles, teleporting minions, and levitating sword traps. Warriors like Zato-1 can use his ally, Eddie, to attack an enemy from both sides, or to feign an offensive maneuver. Chipp can use his speed and his ability to teleport to confuse his opponents and break through their defenses. Theres a character to suit every style, and no two feel alike.', 'If youre new to games like Guilty Gear, Xrd is packed with loads of helpful tutorials and challenge modes to ease you into the action. The tutorials are impressive in their depth, covering all the basics before detailing advanced concepts like mix-ups, zoning and space control, and more. The challenge modes introduce each characters unique special moves and teach a broad mix of combos, covering a range of options including standard bread and butter combos, anti-air punishes, and counter-hit combos. These instructional modes teach not only entry-level mechanics unique to Guilty Gear Xrd, they also impart knowledge of fundamental concepts present in most two-dimensional fighting games. With them, Guilty Gear Xrd does an admirable job of making it all accessible not only for those of us making the jump from other fighting games, but for those checking the genre out for the very first time.', 'Rest assured, however, that despite its commendable approach to newbies, Guilty Gear Xrd is a game whose learning curve ramps from gentle slope to sheer brick wall seemingly in the blink of an eye. This is an incredibly complex and technical battleground populated by some of the most imaginative and downright bizarre protagonists in any game, anywhere. It will push your dexterity and reactions, and reward your patience. Memorizing basic combos opens the door to learn exponentially more difficult ones incorporating mid-air dashes, double jumps, counter hits, and more. Learning new ways to unleash the offensive potential of my character left me with a sense of satisfaction; taking that knowledge into an actual match and executing it correctly imparted a sense of pride.', 'While Xrd will feel immediately familiar to long-time Guilty Gear fans, a surprising amount has changed. The Roman Cancel system returns in expanded form, allowing players to cancel out of virtually any attack animation, whether it made contact with the opponent or not - a first for the Guilty Gear series. Dust Attacks, which launch your target far into the air to be juggled, have also been expanded upon, with Xrd implementing a dashing follow-up which opens all new combo options to utilize against enemies in the corner. Then theres the Blitz Shield, a powerful new defensive tool that can quickly reverse the momentum of a match, giving you breathing room against an especially aggressive opponent. Xrd has enough new features and mechanics to feel like a true sequel, while excellently retaining many of the classic elements that impart the good old feeling of a Guilty Gear game.', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'The very same goes for Xrds look. In combat, colors abound, with the three-dimensional combatants cell-shaded so as to replicate the series traditional two-dimensional sprites. Battles unfold amidst gorgeously-rendered backgrounds. Each of the characters sport hundreds of unique animations that breathe life into both old favorites and new challengers. The fights are amplified by the heavy metal soundtrack, another Guilty Gear convention done justice.', 'Guilty Gear Xrds multi-player modes are the standard fare for fighting games, at this point. You can engage in duels with your friends from the couch, or you can take your skills online to challenge players from around the world in Player Matches or Ranked Matches. The addition of cross-play between PS3 and PS4 is a welcome addition, but Xrds online matchmaking lobbies are arranged oddly. The somewhat un-intuitive interface sometimes makes it difficult to find opponents quickly. In addition, Xrds netcode can make it difficult to connect to the matches you do finally manage to sift out, and once connected, even steady connections can suffer from stuttering and other latency issues.']",IGN
108,Just Dance 2015,9-Dec-14,Zack Stein,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/09/just-dance-2015-review,"['Two words sum up the five-year-old Just Dance series: predictable and fun. You know youll get recent pop hits, a few disco classics, and a smattering of novelty tunes, accompanied by color-saturated videos displaying simple dance moves for you to imitate. And youll earn some points, whether youre trying your best or napping on the couch. But with impressive video production, more precise player tracking (thanks to the Xbox Ones Kinect, which is all but required to play), and a fully realized social component, Just Dance 2015 is a welcome, surprising reinvigoration of the series.', 'The 45 songs included in Just Dance 2015 are mostly of the pop variety, including recent earworms such as Pharrells Happy, Let it Go from Disneys Frozen, and Katy Perrys Birthday, but there are several curveballs as well. Classics like Aint No Mountain High Enough from Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell sit alongside Holding Out for a Hero by Bonnie Tyler and Xmas Tree by Bollywood Santa. Want to dance to the Tetris theme? Its in there as well, along with Frankie Bostellos Mahna Mahna (which you probably know from The Muppets).', 'You truly see your moves registering on the Kinect, and the sense of accomplishment from nailing a move is that much more gratifying because of it. However, while Just Dance 2015 is better at rewarding good dancing than past versions, its points-for-all scoring system means anyone whos detected by the Kinect will end up with a score, regardless of whether they were moving at all. That forgiving nature will always be its Achilles heel, and reduces the sense that a high score was well earned. Dance Central this isnt.', 'Im not much of a dancer, and I wasnt any better after playing, but thats just fine with Just Dance. Its more about having fun while moving to the beat. Im guessing professional dancers look at Just Dance the way professional drivers might look at the Burnout series. These arent moves youll pull off in real life, but theyre certainly fun in a video game.', 'The Kinect controls are responsive, but my family and I often found ourselves reaching for the controller to navigate the menus. Its just faster and easier, but even then, the menu and navigational systems continue to be as confusing and frustrating as ever. The new glossy look and fun graphical touches cant hide some of the mind-boggling decisions made as to how this whole thing operates. For instance, you cant just hit B to go back. Whether you picked the wrong song, or youre looking for a different menu, you have to wait for a back button to appear at the top right, move the cursor up there, and then click. And the badges icon on the home screen that tells you how many youve earned -- thats not a button. To actually look at your rewards, thats a different button top right. Considering all the other upgrades Just Dance has received, its time the menus and navigation received the TLC they deserve. The one thing it does very right, though, is the voice-activated Just Dance! command that gets you right into the action once youve selected your song. That never got old.', 'Up to six people can dance at once locally, and players can jump in and out of a song as they please, making it ideal for parties or ending fights between children. And while Im 64 and my youngest is three feet tall, we were both seen and scored appropriately (I won!). Then my wife and my seven-year-old joined in, and Just Dance 2015 adjusted without a hitch (my wife won).', 'Where youll really see Ubisofts effort is in the music videos for the dance numbers. While Just Dance has always been a celebration of color saturation, this years videos are, for the most part, much more creative and unique. For instance, this version of Katy Perrys Dark Horse is inspired by the original, Egyptian-themed music video. A lead dancer, initially dressed as Cleopatra, morphs throughout the song into a variety of elaborate costumes. A chorus of digitally added dancers backs her up across a variety of dissolving Egyptian backgrounds, and its all impressively choreographed and lit. Its truly entertaining, even if youre a wallflower.', 'Meanwhile, the evolution of Just Dance into a multiplayer game has made huge strides this year. The series has flirted with social interaction in the past, but Just Dance 2015 is a full-fledged virtual dance party. Hopping onto the World Dance Floor takes you to a lobby where you can choose to dance against another player one on one, or jump right into a dance party with up to eight players competing for the high score. It all worked seamlessly, free of hiccups or lag.', 'Another social addition to Just Dance 2015 is the ability to take on a ghost dancer challenger, which reenacts another players high-scoring performance on screen and reveals how it was done as you compete against it. Similar features have long been a motivating part of racing games, and its nice to see this integrated so well here.', 'Watching videos uploaded by other dancers around the world is strangely compelling, and its fun to see how your videos have been received by the community. The Video Gallery is also proof that there are a lot of good dancers out there, and that Just Dance players are quite the diverse bunch.', 'If you dont have a Kinect, you can play Just Dance 2015 by downloading the Just Dance Motion Controller app to your smartphone, using the motion of your phone to track your moves -- like a hi-tech maraca. It absolutely dilutes the experience, but it is an option.']",IGN
109,Threes,9-Dec-14,Dan Stapleton,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/09/threes-review,"['A puzzle game should be quick and easy to pick up and play, but deep and challenging enough that its difficult to put down - thats the cliche ideal. Threes is the embodiment of that ideal. Its elegantly simple matching gameplay and surprising layer of charm and subtle personality put it up there with the classic Tetris as one of the very best of their kind.\n\n\n', '', 'A four-by-four grid full of numbered cards makes Threes look like a math-based game at first glance, but theres virtually no calculation involved in this mental exercise. Simply swiping up, down, right, or left causes all cards on the board to move one space in that direction (if possible), and matching cards that are pushed against an edge combine and collapse them into a single, higher-value card. For example, smooshing a 3 into another 3 makes a 6; smooshing that 6 against another 6 creates a 12, and so on. Every move you make adds pressure by bringing in a new card from the opposite side. This simple idea grows increasingly complex and tough when the board inevitably fills up with cards, and space becomes scarce.', 'Getting a high score and topping the leaderboards  the sole goal of Threes only mode  becomes all about learning to see several moves ahead, and visualizing what the board will look like after several swipes and card combinations. You can peek by sliding a card most of the way over to see what the board will look like (on the Xbox One, this is done with the right stick). But because of the random placement of new cards in one of the four slots on the side opposite your last move, Threes isnt a solvable puzzle or a fair and level playing field, and that means its endlessly challenging. Its similar to the brinksmanship created by luck of the draw in Tetris, when you risk everything betting that a long piece will finally materialize at the last possible moment before the board fills up.', 'Whats more, the brilliant puzzle is set to a catchy, accordion-heavy theme song that feels like something out of a Parisian cafe. Even though its just one track, its long and sufficiently varied that Im still humming along after hearing it literally hundreds of times  in fact, its often playing in my head even when Threes isnt running.', 'Sound design is also brilliant, granting each numbered card a distinct voice and personality  something I wouldnt have thought possible upon hearing the description of its simple look. The high-pitched and childlike Hello! of the 3, the Sup? from 6, 48s dopey Oh garsh, 96s angry-sounding Grrrr, 192s snobby Hello gentlemen, and so on often trigger when numbers appear, and theyll let out exasperated sighs or prod you with Go already! when you take too long (for their taste - theres no actual time limit) to consider your move, and a nope! or nuh-uh dismisses your attempts at invalid moves. All the voices have several different takes on their lines, and they dont play at every opportunity, ensuring they dont quickly wear out their welcome.']",IGN
110,The Crew,2-Dec-14,Luke Reilly,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/02/the-crew-review,"['The Crew is an immense and unique online-only racing game that, above all else, boasts an ambitious open world of such preposterous proportions it ought to rank amongst some of the years most remarkable technical accomplishments. Its size, however, has taken a toll on The Crews visuals and effects, and its problems dont stop there. Sound generally lacks oomph, the economy is stingy, the multiplayer community is only loosely connected, and the missions are too often undermined by some incredibly frustrating AI that brazenly cheats in a misguided attempt to ratchet up the tension.', 'What The Crew gets right is its stylised and scaled-down version of the entire continental USA. Cities are shrunken caricatures, but the truly vast sweeping tracts of land between them means traversing it really does capture the spirit of a cross-country, city-to-city road trip better than any driving game before it. Plenty of racing games curate a bunch of different backdrops into their track selections, from urban street races in major American metropolitan centres to icy blasts across snow-swept mountains, flat-out sprints across the baking desert, or muddy expeditions through giant Sequoia forests. The Crew admirably does all this in a single game world you can drive across in one lengthy session.', 'This girth has come at a cost, though. Its a world that looks fine whipping by you at speed, but it favours sheer size over the kind of granular detail we now expect in modern open world racers. Cities are smattered with recognisable landmarks but dont really seem built to stand up to stationary scrutiny. Combined with low-detailed NPC cars (complete with entirely black, opaque glass), some forgettable effects (splashing water is especially dire), no weather, and the fact that the models of the 40-or-so cars are in a league below those of contemporaries like Forza Horizon 2 or Driveclub, The Crew struggles to shake the look of a game several years older than it actually is.', 'There is, however, a charming sort of daftness to this condensed ode to the US. The Crews version of Californian race track Laguna Seca is hopelessly primitive compared to the renditions available in dedicated tracks racers like Gran Turismo 6 or Forza Motorsport 5, but being able to drive off of it in real time, leave the facility and be drifting around a space shuttle in Cape Canaveral on the other side of the country within the hour has a certain infectious appeal about it.', 'The Crew bills itself as an MMO but it felt largely like a single-player experience my first time through the campaign. There were definitely other players on the map in my vicinity, but I only rarely saw another car close up, and only twice all week was I invited by a random stranger to join his or her co-op mission. I tried on multiple occasions to trigger co-op missions myself but these invitations time out if nobody accepts them, and time out they did. I found myself launching the missions solo rather than waiting patiently for no-one to respond.', 'Id suggest finding some like-minded friends to play the co-op story missions with rather than relying on the game to find willing strangers from your session, as it feels like the most reliable way to experience co-op in The Crew. Its certainly the most entertaining way to play it, and it only takes one human player to nab the objective for all of you to successfully complete the mission. It also means youll have a better chance of emerging victorious against the often overpowered AI and makes the sometimes irksome takedown missions a lot less punishing, considering there will be up to four of you trying to slam a single vehicle off the road.', 'Said overpowered AI is perhaps the most frustrating trait of The Crew; its obsessed with making sure the computer-controlled opponents you face, race, or chase in the games solo and co-op missions can always keep up with you, regardless of how completely outclassed by high-level cars they should be. Its especially exasperating towards the games end.', 'The supposed difficulty of an event is determined by what your car performance level is compared to whats recommended. The thing is, Id attempted to complete a race with a car level a fraction below what was recommended and found it impossible to keep up with the pack. It seemed like a reasonable enough outcome until I went back to replay a previously completed race, against cars with a significantly lower car level than mine, and found I simply couldnt pull away. In fact, some of them were blitzing past me, even after theyd crashed out just a minute before. Normalising the AI to be able to match pace with the monster youre driving undermines the whole upgrade system. It also extends to the AI-driven cop and enemy cars, who have a supernatural ability to bend the games driving physics to their whims and capture you surprisingly rapidly, even if youre reversing away from them at full throttle with nobody blocking the road behind you.', 'The Crew is an arcade racing experience through and through, and its one that actually improves as you progress and your cars stats are buoyed by earning vague performance parts via completed missions and driving challenges. These challenges, which test your speed, control, and off-road abilities, are dotted all over the map and can be triggered on the fly, and the process of picking one up is seamless... until you succeed, at which point the barrage of overlays beaming numbers into your brain concludes with a short loading screen, after which youll find your car stopped dead in its tracks. Its a real momentum killer.', 'At any rate, I like the handling more than, say, the slightly floaty and imprecise old Black Box-era Need for Speed games, but its a little less honed than the likes of a responsive arcade driving game like Driver: San Francisco. Importantly, I found the default driving settings, with a host of driving aids activated, far too muted. Id recommend experimenting with the sport and hardcore presets.', ""Less appealing is the vapid story thats supposed to be coaxing us through The Crews 30- to 40-hour main salvo of missions. Ubisoft has shirked the slightly quirky approach that worked so well for Driver: San Francisco and opted for a far more po-faced plot plucked from the same pile of napkins EA uses to scrawl down story beats for Need for Speed. So were down-on-his-luck street racer and Gordon Freeman cosplayer Alex Taylor, framed for murdering his own brother, working with the FBI and a crew of other ne'er-do-wells to clear his name. To do so he needs to infiltrate a nationwide racing gang with the most contrived internal ranking system this side of a criminal empire conceived by Hot Wheels. Its asinine stuff, even for a video game."", 'Theres a fairly narrow selection of main mission types dangling from this hokey narrative thread, and theyre all generally riffs on a few core concepts. Youre mostly either partaking in some standard racing (to be honest, these are generally the best events), escaping from the cops, or chasing down an enemy vehicle to shunt off the road. Later on The Crew adds off-road barrel smashing runs (that seem inspired by a similar mission type in Driver: San Francisco) and occasionally mixes things up with fun multi-class races that put you in a slower car thats nonetheless able to take shortcuts your opponents cant. The mission set gets repetitive but the locations are pleasantly ever-changing: one moment you might be negotiating the grid layout of Manhattan, and an hour or so later youll be tearing up a dirt track as you weave through a Louisiana bayou.', 'Sticking to the campaign isnt as lucrative as Id anticipated, however, and at the end of it all I found myself at the level cap, out of story missions and without enough cash to buy any of the most-desirable cars (of which there arent as many as Id anticipated there would be; far less than even the likes of the original TDU, The Crews spiritual ancestor). Youll need to put in a good deal of work to build the funds youll need to afford the games hypercars (without stooping to investing real money in The Crews wholly unnecessary microtransaction system).', 'Happily theres still plenty to do following the conclusion of the main thread and once you hit level 50 you unlock the ability to secure platinum car parts (as opposed to gold ones) that come with a random car stat boost. Its at this point The Crew truly settles into its RPG groove as youre encouraged to grind challenges until you score the best possible drop of car loot for your ride.', 'Youll need these platinum parts to make any sort of meaningful dent in The Crews PvP lobbies. Theres another layer of very lengthy events outside the main story thread (at least one of which warns us it will take four hours to complete) but I found the PvP races are actually a far better source of cash. The online racing is robust and, although its biased towards whoever brings the fastest car (unlike the single-player, for better or for worse), its very generous with cash prizes. Whether youre winning or not (and I generally wasnt) I always felt incentivised to keep plugging away. The PVP racing itself, which you can compete in either individually or with teammates, was dependable during testing but at its most enjoyable with collisions turned off. I particularly like how the enormous nature of the world means discrete tracks appear to available in spades, although it could probably do with some kind of voting system for event types to make things more democratic (rather than leaving it solely to the racer in first place). Ive enjoyed the PvP but I dont know that Im engaged enough to keep coming back to it.']",IGN

From the soft green glow of the clones goggles while crouching in the shadows, to the ever-present antagonist humorously berating you as you progress, the comparisons arent hard to make. But, thanks to its incredibly challenging puzzle design - buoyed by a variety of gadgets and brilliant progression - and its great implementation of Wii U-specific features, Stealth Inc. 2 doesnt just differentiate itself from the games that influenced it; it stands out as one the best games available on the eShop.', 'In Stealth Inc. 2, you control a squat, bulbous clone who is helping his more dimwitted clone brethren escape their dire fate. Exploring the sprawling cloning facility is a harrowing, rewarding affair thanks to the variety of gadgets - which grant abilities like hacking, teleporting, and even cloning - that continuously provide interesting new ways to overcome the ever-more difficult puzzles and enemies. In each new section of the facility, youll come across test chambers that introduce you to a new gadget and provide a variety of different challenges that require its use. With each test chamber you complete, more of that section of the facility becomes available, until, ultimately, you receive the gadget and are able to use it freely outside of the test chambers. In addition to that, each test chamber also features a leaderboard with the fastest completion times, providing impetus to replay them multiple times.', 'I was impressed with how brilliant this try-it-before-you-get-it design is.The first gadget, the Inflate-a-Mate, is a small device that can be freely thrown around and then inflated to make a platform. The test chambers started out with me using it to simply reach higher ledges, but then slowly introduced other applications, like inflating it in mid-air to crush an enemy robot or using it as a shield to block lasers. By the time I completed all its test chambers, I felt like an expert with the gadget, and once I was free to use it in the facility, I was able to immediately explore a variety of previously inaccessible locations. The balance between utilizing the mastered gadgets freely and learning the ins-and-outs of a new one in isolated test chambers is fantastic.', 'While the test chambers enforce all the different ways to use a single gadget, its through combining them with your clones other abilities in the facility that youll really be pressed. The high of collecting another gadget was always followed by the realization that there was now one more possible variable in solving the oncoming puzzles. Still, that made every cracked puzzle - oh, I should hack the robot, lift him onto this ledge, have him flip this doors switch and then teleport up there - all the more rewarding.', 'In the moments where I was stumped by a puzzle and scratching my head, it was Stealth Inc. 2s twisted sense of humor that usually kept me going. A begrudged scientist - who is one clone kill away from being the employee of the month - watches over your clones progress, and projects hilariously dark messages onto the walls, many of which will taunt you as your clone is crushed, fried, sliced or otherwise murdered. Stealth Inc. 2s implementation of Miiverse also helps with trickier puzzles, as other players can leave messages throughout the facility to provide hints as to what to do next. It feels like a more descriptive version of the messaging system in Dark Souls 2, and it definitely saved me from banging my head against the wall for too long.', 'While crouching in the shadows to avoid sentry robots and surveillance cameras is a pivotal mechanic of Stealth Inc. 2, the facility itself is monotonously dark. There are a few brief moments where your clone is on the exterior of the facility, with a sunset providing a rich orange backdrop, but the majority of Stealth Inc. 2 is spent in darkness. I found exploring the drab facility to be especially trying while playing on the GamePad, as the lower resolution made hidden vents and passages that much harder to discover.', 'While off-TV play isnt great for extended periods of time, the GamePad is put to good use in the surprisingly robust co-op mode. The player using the GamePad is able to view the entire room, and can draw messages on the screen or circle important locations which then appear on the TV for the co-op partner. The GamePad player also has unique abilities not available in single-player, such as making the clone invisible or producing a decoy clone to distract the enemy robots. To provide extra challenge, some of Stealth Inc. 2s enemies will be invisible on the TV, requiring the GamePad user to uncover them for the other player to see. I expected this mode to simply feature two clones running about, but instead, it provides an incredibly fun and thoughtful twist on Stealth Inc. 2s gameplay.', 'Depending on your mental fortitude, Stealth Inc. 2 will probably take anywhere from five to 10 hours to complete. Luckily, if youre in the mood for more clone espionage after youre done, there is a level editor and community-built levels to enjoy. Using the level editor isnt the most intuitive experience, but all the tools are there to make great puzzles for your friends or the online community. I sampled a few of the more highly-rated custom stages, and while they werent quite up to par with the quality of the test chambers, they provided enough of a challenge to keep me engaged.']",IGN
112,Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris,8-Dec-14,Dave Rudden,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/08/lara-croft-and-the-temple-of-osiris-review,"[""Returning to the isometric-perspective template set by Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light after watching Laras personality shine in last years Tomb Raider reboot seemed disappointing at first, but Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris was quick to remind me that energetic adventure through visually impressive locations and dangerous, puzzle-filled ruins is what this series is all about. This story-light, puzzle-heavy, co-op adventure is almost as essential as Lara's third-person excursions."", ""There's really only one thing missing from this version of Lara Croft: personality. The high-angle isometric perspective may work in terms of showing large sections of the visually distinct temples and properly framing the brain-bending puzzles, but even when engaging in rare banter with her team of co-op allies, this iconic adventurer heroine doesn't show anything resembling emotion or even vulnerability as we watch her explore the gorgeous yet dangerous environments from afar."", ""Its the Temple of Osiris itself that fills that void with creative level designs: From the lavish golden flourishes of a mirror-based temple to creepy green eyes adorning the poison-tinged traps, the biggest carrot dangling in front of me wasn't the resolution of Lara's battle against the Egyptian god Set or more loot, it was seeing what new hazardous wonders awaited Lara Croft and company."", ""Much like Lara Croft's original adventures, combat in Temple of Osiris largely exists to fill the gaps between puzzles. While there's a level of excitement that accompanies testing every new gun as you find them  machine-gun pistols, a magic staff, a rocket launcher, and a high-powered rifle  the resurrected rank and file populating Egypt never really poses much of a fight, save for a few boss fights and wave-based battle challenges available in the hub world."", 'Fortunately, the obstacles put in Lara\'s path more than make up for the average gunplay. The pacing of the puzzles throughout this six-hour adventure is the key. As you start each of the nine tombs you\'re given an introduction to the core puzzle type, whether it be reflecting the orb-destroying beam from the staff of Osiris, lighting torches that power gates, or finding the correct path through spike-laden grounds that escalate quickly into some truly tricky trials at the end of an excavation.In addition to the stages througout the campaign, there are also five ""Challenge Tombs,"" each featuring a puzzle even tougher than the mandatory stuff.', 'Whats really impressive is how the puzzles in Temple of Osiris scale in scope when youre playing them by yourself or with a party of up to four. Where a solo puzzle had me pushing combustible orbs to temporarily depress switches or using my momentum while rappelling down a wall, replaying it with partners added variables. Switches would be moved to different areas, orbs would removed entirely, and brick walls would be put where a clear path used to be in order to force teamwork and communication.', ""It's a bit jarring to go from having a full suite of puzzle-solving tools on hand as a soloing Lara to depending on one of the two magician class characters to properly wield the essential Staff of Osiris.I found my couch co-op experience far more conducive to the adventure than playing online; I could easily point my partner to a specific spot where I wanted them to go, or even switch controllers if I felt their skills were better suited to use the archaeologist-exclusive grappling hook to solve a given puzzle. When playing online, those things become a bit tricker, but either way, working out a complex puzzle with a friend or team is even more fulfilling than solving a single-player stumper. Additionally, a strictly solo experience won't include cooler, action-packed co-op activities like flanking enemies, rappelling off a partner, or doing a tightrope walk between two tethered friends."", ""Playing solo, the first run-through for each of the nine temples took 15 to 20 minutes, though there's are plenty of reason for return visits. Beyond gathering the new weapons, you can collect gems to spend on treasure chests that contain one of two accessories. More common are rings that can increase attributes like bomb radius or rate of fire, but often detract from another, such as defense level. Even rarer are items that change your projectile weaponry to add fire damage or transfer enemy damage into your health. However, since rings only affect combat, which isnt anything special, their usefulness is limited. I wish the amulets could have come into play a bit more, but they're only activated after amassing multiple kills or collecting a lot of gems, and the effects run out pretty fast. Additionally, the amount of single-hit kill obstacles like spikes or pits that drain your entire combo meter in death often render amulets useless. That led to a trickle-down effect where jostling co-op partners for our own gem collections wasn't as competitive as it could be, since the bigger-ticket collectibles like permanent stat boosts and new weapons are shared amongst the group.""]",IGN
113,Xeodrifter,15-Dec-14,Mikel Reparaz,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/15/xeodrifter-review,"[""The original Metroid has inspired plenty of games over the years, but few of them wear it on their sleeves quite as earnestly as Xeodrifter. Spanning four short, monster-filled alien worlds, Xeodrifter's quasi-8-bit art style, moody sci-fi trappings, and nonlinear, item-driven exploration all seem clearly meant to evoke Samus Aran's 2D adventures. Flexible weapon upgrades and clever ideas for interacting with the background elevate it above derivative-clone status, but it also fails to live up to its inspirations standards for enemy and boss-battle variety."", ""Xeodrifter revolves around a little astronaut whose warp engine dies around a cluster of four planets, forcing him to scour their caves them in search of a replacement. Its four to six hours of the usual stuff - if water's blocking your way, for example, you need to be able to turn into a submarine, while scaling the heights of tall shafts usually requires a jetpack. The cool platforming twist is that you can jump into the distant background, which is actually a parallel plane, turning you into a tiny astronaut fighting tiny monsters until you can work your way past whatever obstacle has been set in front of you and leap back into the foreground. This puts the Nintendo 3DS 3D effect to excellent use, which - along with being able to see level maps and tweak your guns on the touchscreen, rather than a less-elegant pause screen - edges it ahead of the PC version."", ""Xeodrifter takes an interesting approach to weapon upgrades, too. Scattered around its four worlds are health points and gun points, and the latter can be redistributed freely across five different categories. These can make your shots faster, more powerful, or more frequent, as well as scattering them in three different directions or making them move in wavelike patterns, letting you tinker with your starting pea-shooter until it suits your play style. (And you'll need to tinker, because apart from some vague icons, there's no clear indicator of what each category does.) You can also re-spec your gun at any time, as well as store three different configurations for fast switching. It's a fun feature, and it kept me experimenting and searching for hidden gun points even after the credits rolled."", ""While gun points just lie around in the open, however, the six exploration-enabling abilities are earned through boss fights  and here's where things start to feel unambitious. Xeodrifter's a pretty short game, but even so, its pool of enemies is pretty small. Not only will you frequently encounter the same handful of palette-swapped creatures from world to world, which diminishes the distinctness created by their different environments, but the bosses are always the same type of monster: a giant, semi-adorable mantis-hedgehog thing with easy-to-spot attack patterns. These patterns stay the same from boss to boss; each subsequent creature adds something new, like a seemingly impenetrable energy shield that emits gigantic laser blasts, or the ability to belch miniature versions of itself into existence, but it also retains all of the previous bosses' abilities. It's a strangely fun approach  dodging a familiar attack from a new boss and dealing a ton of damage in return is awfully satisfying  but the lack of variety also means there's very little thought involved. Knowing enough tricks to quickly smash the final boss might make you feel like a badass, but it's only because you've already had too much practice for the beast to be much of a challenge."", ""Xeodrifter also pads its four- to six-hour runtime with what feels like artificially high difficulty. There are checkpoints before and after boss fights, and you can save in your ship outside each level's entrance, but that's it. Dying after any amount of exploration or item-gathering can erase a lot of progress, which is especially frustrating when you're just backtracking all the way to the level entrance so you can move on after a boss fight. This is different from the challenge of a roguelike, since the levels arent randomized, and it gets repetitive when you have to retrace your steps frequently."", ""It's also worth pointing out that monsters are usually placed in ways that make them very easy to run into if you're not keeping a careful eye out for them (one particularly annoying stretch puts a huge, powerful enemy right at the end of a long lake of magma that you have to dash across at high speed, making a collision almost unavoidable). And even if you're being cautious, there's always a chance an enemy will suddenly rocket into you from an off-screen hiding place, particularly when you're moving slowly underwater or navigating a hard-to-see background cavern.""]",IGN
114,Rugby 15,4-Dec-14,Nathan Lawrence,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/04/rugby-15-review,"['Rugby union fans have been starved for authentic video game representations of their beloved sport for years now, with the last truly strong rugby game being Rugby 08. Sadly, Rugby 15 is not the game to break the drought. In fact, its an utter disaster.', 'Of all the various sports that share the football classification, rugby union is one of the trickiest for newcomers to wrap their heads around thanks to a myriad of rules and complexities. While scoring points is the same logic as other forms of footballgetting a ball across a try line or kicking a ball between goal postsconverting kick-off to try time involves a number of key set pieces.', '', 'Mauling...', 'For instance, ground is gained by a kicking game, thats governed by specific rules of whether the ball lands out on the full, bounces before the out-of-play line or is caught on the full behind the 22-metre line and marked. The team in possession of the ball can run as many phases as they like, unless theres an infringement or they kick the ball. When tackled, the player holding the ball must release it, as players from both sides pile in and form a ruck, which can only be entered from the side. Scrums and mauls can be used to drive the ball across the try line or gain precious metres, while line-out kicks are essential for gaining ground.', 'In short, rugby union is a tricky game to learn, and developer HB Studios deserves kudos for condensing the complexities of the game into a relatively simple arcade-style control scheme. Unfortunately, for gamers hoping Rugby 15 will be the gateway to understanding union, theres a lack of a meaningful tutorial, or any specific training modes for the various components of the sport. Instead, youll have to learn by way of ten static training screens and in-game control reminders.', 'For the most part, the controls are all very easy to come to grips with, but it almost instantly comes apart after kick-off. As I played, it became increasingly clear to me that the gameplay stops and starts based on what the player is doing. While its nice to be at the centre of the action, it makes for boring rugby, as both sides stand around waiting for you to act.', 'For instance, at kick-off, your AI teammates only start moving after youve fully completed the drop-kick start of play, and the kicker stands stuck on the spot for a second or two before being able to move. Even if you switch players immediately after kicking, its impossible to perform cheeky ten-metre starts/restarts that give you the opportunity to gain possession and make easy ground.', 'Similarly, there were times when I pulled the ball out of the back of a ruck and just stood there watching the opposing team stand around, oblivious to my possession until I took a step forward. The best tactics were to deliberately relinquish possession to gain easy metres. I found the most successful and repeatable tactic, regardless of difficulty level, was to perform a box-kick from the back of a ruck to gain ground. As long as the kick stayed on the field and outside of the 22-metre line (where the AI will take a mark), its incredibly easy to force a turnover.', '', '...stomping...', 'Basic tackling is as easy as guiding your selected player into the opposing player with the ball. Or any opposing player for that matter, as you never seem to get penalised for tackling players that arent carrying the ball. In fact, outside of ruck infringements, I rarely got penalised for anything. Forward passes were never noticed or penalised, whether performed by me or the opposing team, and off-side penalties were only awarded about ten percent of the time.', 'As for ruck penalties, theyre incredibly easy to avoid. Once the player carrying the ball is tackled, you have to push the right stick into a predetermined sweet spot that rushes from red to yellow to green, then you can take possession of the ball. Attempting to take the ball when the meter is red results in an instant penalty; yellow is a risky grab that may result in a penalty (and is, surprisingly, easier to get away with in hard difficulty); while green is safe to grab, except when the referee erroneously pings you from time to time for a legal grab.', 'The ruck mechanic is glitchy when in possession of the ball, meaning I had to hit the right trigger to release the ball before attempting to play the meter game. If I didnt do this, Rugby 15 stopped registering controller input for a few precious seconds. This is a problem that plagues that PlayStation 3 version of the game more than anything else (also outside of rucks). Given the specific way youre forced to ruck, its best not to be in possession of the ball until youre within ten metres of the try line, so you dont have to deal with the incredible frustration of losing possession because the game bugs out.', 'Even on the supposedly hard difficulty, its incredibly easy to win back possession in a ruck once you learn the right-stick sweet spot and perfect timing combination.', 'By far the biggest problem I had with Rugby 15, though, was that it rarely felt as though skill or tactics played into scoring tries. When running with the ball, you can flick the right stick up or down, or twirl the stick around completely, to sidestep opponents, but even that mechanic only seemed to work sporadically for me.', 'The game seems to predetermine the outcome of specific plays before the animation occurs, resulting in an inability to pass the ball if it decides youre about to be tackled, or a lack of a sidestep if that stationary player in front of your guy is destined to take you down. Similarly, partial AI control over the player-controlled footballer means that sidesteps and fends automatically occur at the games discretion, while players will regularly run off on their own accord, even if they have the human-controlled icon above their heads. It feels more like rugby roulette than rugby union.', '', '...kicking balls. What a sport!', 'When you eventually make it to the trial-and-error-style try-scoring mechanic, youll discover that there are two ways to score a try. The first, game-encouraged option is to click in the left or right stick to score a try. This proved to be a risky manoeuvre, though, as full-speed players had a tendency to dive over the dead-ball line, resulting in a penalty. Even the opposing team was guilty of this on one occasion, in an uncontested try opportunity.', 'The second, guaranteed option for scoring a try is to run your player over the try line and wait to be tackled. Theres no option to get a player beneath a try attempt to stop them touching down the ball, and a button for charging down a kick is sorely lacking. While theres no sprint option, stamina didnt appear to come into play (despite its presence in the options menu), and pursuing players rarely catch up to a running player, even if their stats determine they should be able to.', 'There are rare moments where the intended gameplay formula bounces to the top of the heap, and local co-op/competitive play improves the rhythm as it helps get around dealing with the atrocious AI. Local multiplayer has its own specific issues, however, particularly in regard to the weird system of tracking and switching players during co-op.', 'Its worth noting the game looks decidedly last-gen, with dated visuals that can become confusing in certain matches where jersey colours are indistinguishable between friend and foe, especially when you consider how frequently players flock in front and behind the off-side line. The PlayStation 3 version of Rugby 15 is particularly ugly, with a lower resolution, darker presentation, plenty of jaggies and a terrible frame rate, to boot. Combine the unappealing visual presentation with the aforementioned game woes, and the PS3 version is unplayable in its current form.']",IGN

(No, it doesn't have anything to do with the man-god of Skyrim.) Barely a second goes by when it doesn't encourage you to either stretch the limits of your mind with some brutally tough but rewarding puzzles or to consider the nature of humanity and the conundrums of empiricist philosophy. It's a game I found myself thinking about more often the longer I'm away from it, and I'm surprised that it's the non-puzzle elements that stick with me the most. This disconnect saddens me. While developer Croteam handles both elements well, they don't complement each other as well as they probably should."", '\n', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', ""It's a fun puzzler  marvelous, even. It doesn't introduce any nifty, novel gimmicks of its own in the vein of Portal's portal gun, but it positively nails using conventional elements like blocks, signal jammers, laser connections, motion-recording devices, and even turrets to complete each puzzle. It eases you into the tough parts (perhaps too gently, as the going is a tad too easy early on), but in time it reaches a pitch of near-orchestral magnitude. Want a real challenge? Go for the puzzles that reward stars."", ""The Talos Principle's first-person perspective puzzles differ from Portal's with their emphasis on deliberate thinking rather than action and speed. In one puzzle alone, I used to block to disable a force field by setting it on a trigger, after which I took a jammer to disable the fan that was blowing me back down one particular corridor. I stripped the head off the disabled fan, then used a laser connector to trigger another pair of doorways by shooting out three beams. I then doubly disabled one of the open force fields with the jammer, and then popped a new cube on a spring before another fan, which sent the cube flying over the wall into the next room with another trigger. I then reconfigured my jammers and connectors to work my way back to the cube, dumped it on the trigger panel, and claimed the tetromino that was my goal."", 'Whew. Such moments feel like completing the Triforce in a Zelda game, and this was just one puzzle out of around 120. It happens often, and Talos Principle maintains that essential ""Aha!"" factor for hours, partly because there are so many gadgets to toy with and combine in interesting ways, although some repetition slips in by the end.', 'The narrating voice overhead here is Elohim (essentially Hebrew for ""god""), and he\'s basically just around to tell you that you\'ll gain everlasting life if you finish all the puzzles, create a sense of forbidden mystery around a big central tower, and suggest the entire world around you is a sham. And hitting ""H"" for a third-person perspective reveals a big surprise of who youre playing as.', 'And that\'s where the philosophy comes in. Running parallel to the puzzle focus is my personal quest to discover who and what I really am and whether I\'m actually a ""person,"" explored through little terminals dot each subzone that beep and boop, begging for interaction. I gained insight from listening to audio logs and reading e-mails from the designers of your world contain everything from inane song lyrics to reflections on an important garbage dump/archaeological site. It explores concepts of humanity and being through quotes by writers like John Milton, William Blake, and others. At times, it even adds to the mystery by letting you partake in surveys testing your humanity, but which seem to be administered by a real person.', ""The Talos Principle asks us to ask ourselves old philosophical questions dating back to Socrates, but by the same token, they're not that hard to grasp. (Some of the sources may also be B.S. created for the story itself.) If there's one thing I don't like about it, it's that the terminal forced me to choose from preset responses most of the time, instead of typing in my own."", ""We've seen stuff like this in The Stanley Parable as well, although with more humor and sometimes to better effect. Here, we almost never have a chance to laugh. But The Talos Principle brings its own appeal, chiefly in the form of (easily readable) QR codes with messages from robots, yammering about the glory of Elohim, or how hard this or that puzzle is. (We should be able to leave some of our own messages for others to read this way  somewhat Dark Souls style  after launch.)"", ""But the puzzling stands just fine on its own, although the lore enriches it and delivers different endings depending on your choices and actions. Even in opening new zones and items, The Talos Principle maintains this devotion to brain teasers. Collecting Tetris-style tetrominos unlocks new zones, new gadgets to use with the puzzles, and eventually that mysterious tower. Once a full set's collected, you line them up much as you would in Tetris at various interface panels before key doors, and those get just as challenging as the puzzles at times. I once sat at a panel for 15 minutes just trying to get the pieces to fit."", ""Opening those doors is a treat, particularly if you're the sort who's already given to studying the peripatetic philosophy spouted throughout The Talos Principle. There's the Roman ruins level, with its obvious debts to Pompeii, Hadrian's Villa, and the Roman forum. There's the ancient Egyptian level, with its nods to the Oxyrhynchus archaeological site at the core of all this, and there's a medieval level with obvious nods to early France. Even the fantastic creeps in other zones, such as in the tower itself, which seems to hold up the world like Stephen King's Dark Tower. Don't look too closely, and at times these views seem almost realistic, partly because the developers scanned real objects and settings before adding them in.

Secret Ponchos focuses on that to the exclusion of all else, delivering a cartoony, multiplayer-only twin-stick shooter in which your only goal is to gun down hyper-stylized opponents while frantically dodging their bullets. Short on content but unexpectedly complex, its oddball gunfighters and cover-filled arenas are a lot of fun... once you've played long enough to understand what you're doing, anyway.\n"", 'There\'s no tutorial or even a practice mode here, so the intricacies of Secret Ponchos\' five distinct characters have to be discovered on live battlefields. There are some similarities; all outlaws have a dodge/dash move powered by a limited stamina bar, everyone can become temporarily invisible by sticking to cover, and their weapons all carry small ammo stocks that have to be manually reloaded. Beyond that, each fighter is a new experience, with two unique weapons, multiple attacks, and different handling, all of which require different strategies. Having to figure all this out while other players are aggressively shooting at you leads to a lot of frustration early on, but at least theres a ""Rookie"" option to match you with players who are going through the same trial by fire.', 'It\'ll likely take some trial and error just to find a duelist you\'re comfortable with. The old, bearded Killer\'s middle-of-the-road stats made him seem like a good starting option, for example, but his slow firing rate and movement are clearly meant for more precise players than me. The same went for The Matador, whose primary weapons  two slow-to-reload banderillas (think bullfighting harpoons)  distract from the fact that she\'s much more capable at close range, with three distinct, devastating attacks available for her ""secondary"" sword and cape.', ""Less meticulous players will want to check out The Deserter, a hulking cavalry soldier who can fire short-range bursts or long-range sniper shots (as well as bowl opponents over with his dodge/dash move); or the Phantom Poncho, a skull-faced bandito with a sawed-off shotgun and a long bullwhip that stuns and then slows anyone it hits. For my part, I finally settled on the low-difficulty Kid Red: a fast-moving, fast-shooting ragamuffin who can hurl dynamite and briefly stun opponents with a special shot from his paired pistols. (I wasn't alone, either, as other Kid Reds quickly filled online matches in the first few days of release.)"", ""Once you've felt out a character's limitations and settled on strategies for using them effectively against other fighters, testing your skills against other players becomes immensely fun and rewarding. That's not the only reason it's important to settle on one character, though  at least at first. Each of your fighters progresses separately, with experience tallied as a bounty; win matches, and it'll grow, letting you increase your fighter's health, firing rate, speed, damage, and stamina regeneration as you reach new levels. This does a lot to foster an attachment to your character, especially since you get to name them (sadly, alternate costumes are available only as paid DLC). The twist here is that you're effectively wagering a chunk of your bounty on every match; losses or poor performance can decrease your bounty and hinder your progress, and that feeling of having something on the line definitely makes things more tense  and gives teammates a justifiable reason to be mad at anyone who doesn't pull their weight."", 'Yet as enjoyable and unexpectedly deep as the combat can be, Secret Ponchos simply doesn\'t have much to progress through once you\'ve mastered its five fighters. It comes with just four stages and three modes  free-for-all, team deathmatch, and domination  and while it\'s possible to mix things up a bit by changing the number of players,  working out strategies for playing alongside different characters, or playing with a friend in the same room via split-screen, things start feeling repetitive before long. It\'s also worth pointing out that deathmatch and domination are essentially identical, except that the former gives each player a single life over three rounds, while the latter has teams fight over a sliding kill meter, with automatic victory handed to the side that pulls ahead by five. This gives each mode a slightly different feel, but ""slightly"" is disappointing when it\'s all that\'s on offer.', ""Finally, Secret Ponchos still has a number of bugs that need to be hammered out. While they seem to be less common after a few post-release patches (I haven't been thrown into any matches lately where I could only shoot myself, for example), it's still not unusual to see animation glitches or, more annoyingly, matches that stall out in the lobby just as they claim to be launching, at which point everyone usually leaves in a huff, one by one. Usually, you can just quit and find another match quickly, but seeing a lobby simply stall out after waiting for it to fill up and count down is always infuriating. Its even more so when you consider that matches can sometimes take minutes to set up, only to be over in seconds if one team mops the floor with the other.""]",IGN

New abilities and twists, such as rhythm-based platforms that disappear on certain beats, and the cherry that can double, triple, or quadruple your character keep the entire six-hour journey feeling fresh.', '\n', 'Each of the 70-ish, bite-sized stages in Captain Toad are laid out like an MC Escher-designed diorama floating in space, and theyre all filled with great puzzles. Theres a great sense of discovery in exploring every nook and cranny of a stage, poking around the GamePad and seeing what you can interact with, and observing your surroundings from every imaginable angle. Guiding the Toads through the stages and learning enemy patterns in order to sneak past them always felt great, and being able to make it through a level in what felt like the optimal manner was nice and satisfying.', 'Most stages only require you to find a star in order to move on, with optional feats that include grabbing a trio of gems, and a unique bonus objective for each level. The stages are relatively simple to complete, but finding all of the secrets gets genuinely challenging. And I always felt motivated to pore over everything, thanks to some really great post-game secrets that can only be unlocked by discovering most of the gems.', 'Most of the time, Captain Toad moves at a slow pace and allows you to take your time navigating each level. You are always in full control of the camera, and while it definitely seemed a bit micro-manage-y, I like the freedom to view the world at whichever angle I wanted. The problem here is that its controlled both through the right stick and the GamePads gyrosensor, and the sensor cant be turned off, so I found the camera spinning out of control whenever I moved my wrists. Also, if youre playing only off the GamePad, messages and touch-screen prompts have a tendency to pop up and really obscure your view at important moments.', '\n', 'Without a single word of text, Nintendo managed to create a pair of sweet, endearing characters that I genuinely wanted to root for. Small details, like how Toad and Toadette cower in fear when they see a ghost, add a nice dollop of charm to the whole package. Sweet storybook vignettes add some extra motivation for pressing on, and the way Treasure Tracker ultimately ties into Super Mario 3D World is pretty great.', 'Its a bummer that the overall package feels a bit cheap because of interface problems. Theres no screen that displays all of your stats on each level, which meant I had to constantly page through the 70 stages to see what I still needed to accomplish. You also cant see the optional objective within the levels themselves, which seems like a silly thing to omit.']",IGN
118,80 Days,4-Dec-14,Mitch Dyer,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/04/80-days-review,"['True to its literary source material, 80 Days greatest asset is words. The mobile adventure game masterfully captures the awe-inspiring wonder of adventure seen in Jules Vernes classic novel, Around the World in 80 Days. It achieves this while exploring a deeper realization of his story in fascinating new ways.', '80 Days is presented as a stylized choose-your-own-adventure novel in which your responses to people and events steer your journey in a unique direction, toward an uncertain fate. Along the way theres a satisfying, surprisingly strategic balance in what youre doing and where youre going, all supported by a smart, energetic story of global and personal discovery.', ""As Passepartout, the French assistant to the English gambler Phileas Fogg, it's your job to manage Fogg's money, schedule, and health in his quest to win a wager: Travel around the world, London to London, in just 80 days. Collecting an item in Europe thats valuable in Asia is an example of its many interesting risk/reward opportunities, which arise every few minutes: you might sell it for a profit that funds speedier travel at the expense of going out of your way. Or, if Foggs health starts to deteriorate, you may need to decide between buying expensive, warmer clothes, or staying more nights at a hotel, which may lead to missing a train that only runs a few days a week."", ""These decisions are tense, exhilarating, and unexpected. I adored rolling the dice on a risky detour, even if it set me back a full week, because of the way I role-played my particular Passepartout. He was never satisfied simply with the task at hand; instead, the need to constantly explore cities, soak in sights, and discover people and cultures took priority. During my travels with Fogg I was robbed by Jesse James, arrested by dirty lawmen, and mesmerized by the 19th-century worlds growing understanding of robotics. I led the mutiny of a ship, sold valuable weapons to other nations, rode the Orient Express, and utterly bankrupted Fogg. I didn't actually see any of this unfold, but I have vivid memories of these events. 80 Days descriptive, beautiful, and concise prose realizes its memorable world brilliantly."", 'Text rolls out over gorgeous, shadowy illustrations of St. Petersburg, San Francisco, Hong Kong, Cairo, and other iconic cities. It explores steampunk and sci-fi elements without making a to-do about any particular setting or theme. Every scene has equal merit as a chapter in your story, and each explores the depth of the world and the sort of man Passepartout is. Id choose how he responded from a short list of three to five options -- sometimes with insecurity, other times with confidence, often enough with aggression to get into trouble. Sometimes a massive gamble paid off; sometimes it ruined me. Other times, a decision presented exciting new opportunities to explore more of a rich, beautiful, and imaginative world.', ""Wherever the story went, I felt ownership and responsibility over my journey. I love 80 Days most for giving me the sense that Im crafting a story, rather than relive something Ive already read -- and theres something marvelous about seeing where else Around the World in 80 Days could have gone, and in hearing the very different places it's taken others.""]",IGN
119,Randal's Monday,1-Dec-14,Chuck Osborn,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/01/randals-monday-review,"['Sometimes its fun to play as the bad guy. After all, cutting loose as a cyclone of pure evil can be invigorating, and perhaps a little therapeutic. Even, um...flawed personalities (like the entire cast of Grand Theft Auto V) can be fun to inhabit as long as the action and writing make them interesting. Then theres Randal Hicks, titular star of the allegedly humorous pop culture nostalgia-fest Randals Monday: hes just a jerk. And not a particularly funny or interesting jerk, either. Combine an unlikeable character with cringe-worthy puzzles, and youve just added a disappointing point-and-click adventure to your inventory.', 'Described by his creators as a kleptomaniac, sociopath, and above everything bad friend, Randal makes it really hard to like Randals Monday. The plot is clever enough; much like Groundhog Day, Randal is cursed to relive the same bad Monday over and over again until he can set things right. But unlike Bill Murrays obnoxious anti-hero, Randal doesnt seem to have a moral center. When confronted with the dismembered body of his best friend, Matt, Randal is too busy making quips to feel remorse. His persistent douchebaggery doesnt get bogged down by pesky character growth or lasting consequences, nor is his narcissistic stupidity made the butt of the joke.', 'Okay, sure, its supposed to be a comedy. Lighten up, right? The issue here is that the dialogue and writing just arent that funny. And this is coming from someone who embodies the target audience of Randals Monday: over 35, loves classic adventure games, and is a fan of Kevin Smith-style comedies packed with pop culture references from the 80s and 90s. In fact, Randals Monday seems to really, really, really want to be part of Smiths Askewniverse; not only does the Randal from the movie Clerks (Jeff Anderson) voice this Randal, theres also a cameo by Jay and Silent Bob, with Jay portrayed by the one-and-only Jason Mewes. Thats where the similarities end, however; the references can be fun, if forced (oh, look, non-sequitur dialogue from The Breakfast Club!), but the gags often fall flat and, worse, occasionally dip into the pools of non-repentant misogyny and homophobia.', 'To make matters worse, the puzzle mechanics suffer from what I like to call adventure game logic - meaning that the solutions defy common sense, and are thus impossible to deduce by a normal human brain. For example, one puzzle requires that a pair of beer bottles be opened. Despite the many objects in your inventory, including a hammer, the only solution is to use the bottles on Matts frozen corpse - an answer that makes my head hurt just thinking about it. If not for the helpful built-in hint system, Randals Monday would drive any sane person to hit the uninstall button.', 'Whats most frustrating about Randals Monday is that, for all its faults, theres a lot to like, too. Its webcomic-meets-Family Guy 2D art style is simple yet engaging, and the user interface is a breeze - simply click on an object for interactive options. (It can be easy to miss items, though, so be sure to press the spacebar to show which objects can be manipulated.) The acting of the cast is uniformly excellent as well, especially Jeff Anderson, who nails Randals self-centered goof-off persona. Older gamers will surely relish the ubiquitous nods to classic games and movies, such as Day of the Tentacle and Terminator 2. (Take a close look at the subway map and youll discover that the streets are all named for characters or designers from the golden age of adventures.) The love for Gen X pop culture is palpable, but wasted on an otherwise disheartening experience.']",IGN

Containing HD updates to 2005s Kingdom Hearts 2 and 2010s Birth by Sleep, its a mouthful of action-RPGs that proves that the series has aged gracefully over the past decade...for the most part.', 'For something originally released during the waning hours of the PlayStation 2s life, Kingdom Hearts 2 holds up surprisingly well on PlayStation 3. Sure, the opening few hours, in which you play as Roxas, are still a boring string of banal tutorial missions that goes on for way too long. But the second youre finally back in control of Sora, it becomes a creative, meaty, and fulfilling action-RPG. His upgraded character design, great voice over, and awesome feel in combat make stepping into his oversized shoes a joy.', '\n', 'As someone who grew up with these movies, characters, and worlds, Kingdom Hearts games are one of my favorite ways to actually interact with them. Hopping back and forth between the worlds of films like Pirates of the Caribbean, The Lion King, and Mulan keeps the 60-hour adventure feeling fresh, and the self-contained stories of each of these locations really nails the tone of their source material. Its colorful and creative representations of these worlds needed only the minor array of upgrades in this HD version to hold up a decade later. The stark neon colors of Trons Space Paranoids world look cleaner and better than ever in HD. However, the same cant be said for the menus themselves, which still look as spartan and bland as they did back in 2005.', 'While the combat in Kingdom Hearts 2 initially comes across as a button-mashy, the past decade has proven theres a lot of depth to uncover throughout your journey. Soras arsenal of attacks, dodges, and juggles grow as you level up, both in power and with great animations that reflect it, and a deep roster of party members (which includes beloved Disney characters that range from Simba to Tron) all encouraged me to continue replaying this old favorite long into the night.', 'To test the skill of even an old hand like myself, HD 2.5 Remix also contains a handful of new bosses pulled from some of the later games, including a bunch of raincoat-clad members of Organization XIII. Most of these provide a crazy level of challenge that forces you to really master the combat system: youll need to have the best weapons, become adept at managing your magic points, and memorize some of most brutal attack patterns this side of Mike Tyson in Punch-Out!!. Great voice work and a remixed soundtrack add to the atmosphere, and shortened load times make the entire thing more enjoyable to revist.', '\n', 'The biggest pain point of getting back into Kingdom Hearts 2 was the control scheme. Over the past decade, its become more or less standard to bind jump to X and attack to square, but HD 2.5 Remix stubbornly sticks to its O to jump, X to attack ways, without offering a more modern and conventional configuration. It certainly didnt stop me, but being uncertain of my own fingers did slow me down.', 'The second major game in the 2.5 Remix package is Birth by Sleep, and HD upgrade of a 2010 PSP game (which I, sadly, missed the first time around). As a prequel to the original Kingdom Hearts, its filled with mostly new and interesting characters and story elements, which helps make the overall plot much easier to understand. Your trio of playable characters  Terra, Aqua, and Ventus  have unique and intertwining stories that deal with some really interesting themes, including how we deal with failure when were surrounded by people whore succeeding. Each has their own set of abilities, too, which sets breaks the gameplay up into three distinct and varied scenarios. And while youre visiting the same classic Disney locales, these different emotional arcs still hit me in a really personal way.', 'Birth by Sleeps combat is a modified version of Kingdom Hearts 2s, but instead of relying on magic points to use a lot of your special attacks, each one has a cooldown period reminiscent of modern MMORPGs or MOBAs. After being immersed turn-based combat for a few dozen hours, I greatly enjoyed this real-time combat systems pacing. Managing constantly recharging skills is a very different task from scouring through items list and finding something that can refill your magic or health, but equally challenging and interesting. It encouraged a level of strategy and on-the-fly planning that previous Kingdom Hearts never really took into consideration.', '\n', 'The biggest thing that holds Birth by Sleep back is that its camera system is more cumbersome than Kingdom Hearts 2s, and is definitely lacking by modern standards. Locking on to enemies feels inconsistent, and rotating your view has a strange weight to it that makes certain close-quarters battles a bit of a chore. But beyond this, the interesting characters, fun battle system, and actually digestible story made Birth by Sleep one of my favorite games in the Kingdom Hearts series. Im glad I got this chance to revisit it.', 'The weak link on this disc is definitely the Re:coded movie, which cobbles together cutscenes from the 2011 game into something thats palatable only for the most die-hard of Kingdom Hearts lore completionists. As someone who loves the series gameplay and sense of exploration, and who finds the overarching story to be a bit of an undecipherable quagmire, Re:coded was a bit like watching a foreign film without subtitles.']",IGN

The first episode of Telltales six-part Game of Thrones game represents that cruel reality explicitly; in two hours of dialogue decisions made with the knowledge that being good and noble might mean the downfall of House Forrester and the original characters you control, it sets up great anticipation for future episodes and delivers a strong ending of its own.', 'First, a warning: definitely do not approach this game as a way to introduce yourself to Game of Thrones. Its made for existing fans, in that it requires a good amount of knowledge of the story, and it begins with a massive spoiler for anyone who hasnt seen the first three seasons or read through the third A Song of Ice and Fire book, A Storm of Swords. For that matter, youre best off skipping this review until youve gotten that far in, since the entire story revolves around fallout from those events.', 'The game mimics the structure of the show (and the books) by jumping between the perspectives of three characters: Garred Tuttle, squire to Lord Forrester; Ethan Forrester, who must step up to rule the Forrester seat of Ironrath in his fathers absence; and Mira Forrester, Ethans older sister and handmaiden to Margaery Tyrell in Kings Landing. Each of them has their own distinct role to play in attempting to salvage House Forresters future, and each maintains the pace with a few difficult decisions to make.', 'Garreds scenes involve a lot of simple, straightforward quick-time event-style action. Its not challenging, but it breaks up the dialogue with brutal bloodshed, and it sets a tone that raises the stakes of the diplomacy that follows. His decisions of whether to try to save everyone or sacrifice them for the greater good are tense, thanks to the ticking clock that adds urgency to almost every dialogue choice, but typical.', 'His bigger quest is to deliver a secret only to certain ears, which is a bit silly because youre never given a reason to want to divulge it. You have to deliberately choose to fail. (And yes, I went back and replayed just to see what would happen if I haphazardly blurted it out at every opportunity.)', 'Scenes from Ethans perspective are some of the strongest. His heated negotiations with the lord of a rival house, while receiving guidance from his advisors, are especially well written and acted. Later, the decision of which of his advisors to elevate above the others also carries weight - not because it has any major impact on this episode, but for the implications for the future aggressive or diplomatic stance of the house. And we get the opportunity to establish our version of Ethan as a harsh or lenient lord.', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'Miras scenes in the capital city of Kings Landing are a good change of setting from the grays and browns of Ironrath, and playing her small part in the power struggle between Margaery and Cersei adds another layer of intrigue to the plot. Choosing just how much to ask of Margaery and how far to bend to appease Cersei  and whether to trust offers of help  are some of the most interesting from the big-picture perspective.', 'Across the board, acting is up to the high standards Telltale has set with its past games. Plus, all the characters from the show who appear - Margaery Tyrell, Queen Cersei and Tyrion Lannister, and Ramsay Snow  are authentically voiced by their TV actors, and the likenesses are good enough that details like Cerseis signature lopsided sneer and slightly raised eyebrow come through.', 'Those portrayals are undermined slightly by occasionally glitchy animations, with characters or limbs sometimes warping into place or briefly vanishing. And while the painterly art style generally looks quite good, the brushstroke effect on backgrounds can be distracting when the camera moves and causes the strokes to shimmer around.', 'Its important to note that most choices in Episode 1 have little or no significant impact within this two-hour section of the story. In fairness, its an episode that positions itself as a prologue, concluding with Your story begins, so much of what makes this a great start for the series is the promises it makes  or implies  for whats to come. It caps off with a powerful and shocking ending that reminds us both of the kind of harsh world were in, and also that the major events of this story are going to be beyond our control.']",IGN
122,WWE 2K15,17-Nov-14,Dave Rudden,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/17/wwe-2k15-review-ps4xbox-one,"[""When Rocky Maivia made his WWE debut in 1996, he had the look and the talent, but he hadn't yet developed the star power that would make The Rock famous. WWE 2K15's debut on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One has a similar mix: it looks and feels top-notch, but doesn't have the feature depth the series has previously delivered, making it feel like a step backward in a lot of important ways."", ""WWE 2K15's most notable improvements are apparent from the first bell. The frenetic pace thats characterized WWE on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 has been slowed considerably, and it's mostly for the best. Take the start-of-match chain-wrestling sequences. These exchanges won't decide the direction of the contest, but they can start the superior technician off with slightly more momentum. While its an option that can be turned off, the sequences are enjoyable and tactical enough that I never wanted to."", ""As the bouts progress, the slower combat is both a blessing and a curse. Punches and kicks feel like they hit harder, thanks to precise collision detection. More importantly, the slower speed makes strikes easier-to-counter, allowing you to effectively shut down annoying strike-spammers. The realistic stamina system isn't quite as beneficial. As matches hit their endgame, things slow down far too much. Weakened competitors will slowly rise from attacks, crawl to the ropes, and stagger across the ring, which can make the final moments of a match either exhilarating or exasperating. While I enjoyed feats like making a desperate push to tag in a fresh partner or slowly draping an arm to make a pin on an equally depleted opponent, there were many more instances where I ran out of gas far too early and became more of a bystander than competitor."", ""The new-gen exclusive MyCareer mode is that same sense of purgatory writ large. I spent well over 10 hours bringing my created superstar from NXT tryouts to WWE Pay-Per-View matches, and ultimately, to championship gold. Along the way, however, not much else really happened. I ran afoul of some factions, had a few one-on-one feuds, and occasionally had to endure difficult tests from authority figures, but I also had to endure an excruciating amount of filler. In between these major events, the vast majority of MyCareer is spent taking part in storyline-free tune-up bouts and dark matches. I would have gladly traded these fights and their utility in improving my character's stats for something a third as long that only included the unique story stuff."", 'Fortunately, The 2K Showcase mode won\'t waste nearly as much of your time. Its a mostly comprehensive look at two major feuds: the Triple H-Shawn Michaels rivalry that ran from 2002 to 2004, and the CM Punk-John Cena feud that kicked off the modern ""Reality Era"" in 2011. There\'s a handful of no-contest finishes and meaningless Smackdown main events that probably didn\'t need to be included though, and the complete lack of WrestleMania bouts like Punk vs Undertaker or Triple H vs Booker T is sad. Still, Showcase lands a little closer to the ""every match matters"" feel of last year\'s 30 Years of WrestleMania than the slew of forgettable recreations found in WWE \'13\'s Attitude Era mode.', ""Old-school talent like Macho Man and Andre the Giant are under-represented, while even some modern stars from last year were also cut, like Zack Rider and Sin Cara. Most of those who made it in benefit from 2K's new-gen overhaul, and many, like Cesaro, Randy Orton, and Dean Ambrose look stunningly accurate. Those who haven't had new-gen attention stick out like sore thumbs, though. Stars like The Rock and CM Punk are only slightly improved (due to the real stars being unavailable for likeness capturing) and some Divas actually look less realistic than their last-gen counterparts. In better news, the creepy glitches that permeated WWE games on the 360 and PS3 have been drastically reduced, but you can still expect some instances of weapons flying out of the ring at mach speed or weirdly twisting limbs defying physiology."", 'Improvements have been made in the audio department as well. It\'s quite obvious that Jerry Lawler and Michael Cole recorded a lot of new commentary, and together to boot. In particular, the beginning of Showcase matches feature good back-and-forth chemistry, which was lacking in the past. There\'s also a good amount of new trivia added for every star, though a bit too much of it is Cole listing a wrestler\'s title wins or Lawler reading off moves. Be warned; a fair amount of dialogue from previous WWE installments is repeated, so you\'ll hear ""he\'s putting his educated feet to good use"" a few hundred times more this year.', ""Even more distressing than the shrunken roster are the creation options and match types that have been dropped between generations. Customized title belts and arenas are gone, which is a bummer, but there are two far bigger omissions: you can't create original stories, nor can you make an original female wrestler. The WWE Universe mode does have expanded story options that you can assign to rivalries, but they're rarely personalized to specific wrestlers, making them a poor alternative to community creations. Match types have also seen drastic reductions. Some gimmicky stuff like Inferno or I Quit matches won't be missed, but the loss of standard elimination matches and four-man Hell in a Cell hurts."", 'While both consoles can put a half-dozen wrestlers on screen (a slight disappointment since that was the same cap on last-gen) the biggest differences between new-gen consoles is that the Xbox One version allows six human players while PlayStation 4 only allows four.  Beyond that, there are no performances differences, as both bring their best 1080p and 60 fps behavior to fights.']",IGN

Experiencing this classic role-playing game again in beautified 3D was truly a nostalgic trip, from the cute friendship-themed plot to the touching end-credits sequence. However, as a remake, it does represent a big missed opportunity to fix several significant balance issues and mechanical problems  the difficulty I had going back after playing the much more modern Pokemon X shows how far Pokemon games have come in 12 years.', 'For the uninitiated, Ruby and Sapphire were the third installments in the Pokemon RPG series and the best-selling Game Boy Advance games of all time. They follow the tried-and-true Pokemon model of journeying to catch new monsters, challenging eight boss-like Gyms, and eventually fighting the Elite Four trainers and the Champion. Like most other Pokemon games they also put you at odds with a villainous team of Pokemon trainers, in this instance Team Magma for Ruby and Team Aqua for Sapphire, who want to use legendary Pokemon to forever change the region of Hoenn, where the games are set.', 'Now theyre the first of the earlier games to receive the 3D treatment. Generation III was a big change from the first two for many reasons, most notably the introduction of Abilities (attributes that add advantages to battle, among other things), Natures (which affect how stats develop) and double battles (using two Pokemon at once was unheard of back in the day). Different areas had their own weather patterns, and the region contained varied topography, from a desert to a volcano to sandy beaches.', 'In 2002 I reveled in the newness and feel of having an untouched world to explore, and that sense of wonder carries over in Omega and Alpha. The scenery is rich, the adorable characters are even more adorable (especially little Wally!), and theres more to many of the cities than there was before. I walked into Mauville City for the first time while playing Alpha and didnt even recognize it. In the original games it was comparatively small and boasted only the bike shop and the Game Corner, but now its like a smaller Lumiose City from X and Y: full of little shops and tons of NPCs to chat with. I actually got lost in Mauville City more than once, and had a lot of fun rediscovering something I thought I knew well.', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', 'Mega Audino Screens', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'Alpha and Omega also bear some resemblance to X and Y in that certain app-like features  Pokemon Amie, Super Training, the Player Search System  have all been integrated as part of the PokeNav Plus. The interface is overcrowded as a result and really cumbersome, but the online apps are welcome additions (especially Wonder Trade) Its the new Pokemon search app, the DexNav, that is perhaps the most interesting addition for Pokephiles. Every so often, a wild Pokemon will peek its ears or tail out of the tall grass (or sand or water), and DexNav will alert you to things like the Pokemons level, ability, and even rare moves it might have. I found two Poochyena this way: a female with Ice Fang and a male with Poison Fang, two egg moves that you can usually only get by carefully breeding. Easy-access breeding material! The app has the potential to help EV trainers as well, since you can see what Pokemon youll face before you battle it, and in that regard it provides another alternative to Super Training aside from traditional, less-accessible methods.', 'Theres also an updated Berry map, first introduced in Gen IV, which is a serious help to anyone who needs Berries for competitive battle... or even Pokeblocks! Remember Pokeblocks? They help your Pokemon up their beauty or cuteness or what have you for Contests, which are of course a part of Alpha and Omega. These Pokemon talent shows have a Japanese pop-idol feel this time, which makes it all seem more modern and updated. Playing as the female trainer, I was literally and figuratively taken under the wing of number-one Contest star Lisia and her Altaria, Ali. Lisia is absolutely adorable, but the best part of Contests for me is undoubtedly the Cosplay Pikachu you receive after winning your first one. Change Pikachus outfit according to the five Contest attributes and Pikachu gets a different move! I might just be a super nerd, but its the best thing since Surfing Pikachu.', 'Really, all the tweaks of original Hoenn features are improvements. Unfortunately, there are still a few big flaws that werent addressed, and theyre even more noticeable in light of more recent Pokemon RPGs. My least favorite part of every Pokemon game is the unnecessary inclusion of too many hidden moves, commonly referred to as HMs (Hidden Machines), which you must teach to your Pokemon in order to progress through the region and arent so easily unlearned. Anything more than Surf and Fly is too much, as far as Im concerned, and Hoenn is one of the worst HM offenders. Alpha and Omega dropped Flash for a total of seven HMs this time around  and in the late-game you can summon Latias or Latios to fly you places, which means you wont need a Pokemon in your team with Fly  but compared to X and Ys five HMs, its obvious why the decision was made to pare them back in subsequent games.', 'Secret Power factors into this too. It isnt an HM, but it is another move that interacts with the overworld and is necessary for building Super Secret Bases. Maybe Im just stingy with what moves I teach my Pokemon, but I wish I didnt need a move at all to check out potential bases during my travels. That aside, having a home base I could decorate in 3D was a lot of fun, and sharing via StreetPass or setting it up for other players to fight through as a mini-Gym are both neat touches.', 'Its not a new complaint, but Hoenn is still imbalanced type-wise, heavily favoring water. Its especially noticeable in Alpha Sapphire, in which Team Aqua (the villains of the piece) use a lot of water types. It feels like there are water Pokemon in nearly every battle, and I have an overleveled Pikachu to show for it. You also have to navigate many bodies of water, since much of the late-game involves the HMs Surf and Dive to get from place to place. Diving was really neat back in 2002 when it was new, but I found it incredibly tedious in Alpha and Omega  an obvious example of how superfluous some HMs are.', 'The water itself is absolutely gorgeous with the new graphics and details, though. One of my favorite parts of the entire adventure was splashing through puddles that reflected the starry skies at night, and even diving was made better by seeing a school of Luvdisc swimming by. Building my Super Secret Base on the rainy Route 119 had an extra-comfy, drinking-tea-on-a-rainy-day feel. Everything in Hoenn, water or not, is either delightfully cute or strikingly beautiful, and I enjoyed seeing the entire region anew  despite the tediousness associated with navigating all that pretty water.']",IGN

But after the impressive freedom of Lego Batman 2 and Lego Marvel, Lego Batman 3 feels far more restrictive in scope, and its inconsistent tone sometimes seems to mock the great DC Comics source material it should be celebrating.', 'Picking up from the end of Lego Batman 2, the villain Braniac drives most of the fun but scattered plot in Lego Batman 3. Without giving too much away, Batman and the rest of the Justice League have to team up with the likes of Lex Luthor, the Joker, and the rest of the Legion of Doom to bring him down, and sort out some trouble with the various Lantern Corps. Its not as strong or as focused a story as in either Lego Marvel or Lego Batman 2, but it manages to keep the interest high through most of the 10 hours or so it took to finish it.', 'To ensure constant variety, Lego Batman 3 uses the same format as Lego Marvel, where different playable characters drop in and out of the missions at each checkpoint. You may be playing as Batman and Robin one moment, and then Green Lantern and Martian Manhunter the next. It definitely helps break up the action, which otherwise might get old quickly due to the simplistic attacks, and celebrates a larger roster of DC favorites. The best new addition to the system is that you can now load specific checkpoints of missions for Free Play; it makes finding all those little secrets so much more convenient.', 'When the story missions are finished, theres loads more to do here, including plenty of other mission-style content. Were sort of left to figure that stuff out for ourselves, which is actually not such a bad thing; accidentally stumbling on a mission that recreates an old Adam West Batman TV show episode was fantastic. There are also options to explore the Hall of Justice and Hall of Doom, which are super fun for a DC fan like myself. I also enjoyed unlocking some of the more obscure characters from the DC canon  Im sure not many people are exactly champing at the bit to play as Etrigan or The Question, but its great that those more obscure characters get to share the stage with the likes of Superman and Wonder Woman.', 'Its clear the game makers love the source material. From Wonder Womans idle animation where she does the Linda Carter-style twirl to Flashs frequent stints on the Cosmic Treadmill and the payoff of that final revelation between Batman and Robin, Lego Batman 3 does a great job of showcasing moments thatll resonate with fans of the comics.', 'While its not quite as developed here as it was in Lego Marvel, I still appreciate that each character has a unique combination of abilities. Martian Manhunter and Superman both have heat vision, but the green guy can also control minds, while Supes has frost breath. This approach to character powers gives us lots of options, which are furthered by the excellent new suit system. No longer do you have to wait to find a station to swap out for the Magnet suit or the Sonar suit, because now characters like Batman, Robin, and Cyborg can change their power setups on the fly. Being able to change at will to any suit youve unlocked eliminates a lot of tedium. Even better, a quick button press instantly swaps you to the suit thats appropriate to the obstacle youve encountered.', 'While not every game has to be open-world to be good, playing Lego Batman 3 made me long for the freedom of Lego Batman 2.  Instead of roaming through the streets of Gotham at your discretion, youre mostly just running back and forth between the Batcave and the Watchtower. There are limited open-world options for the various Lantern planets, but those arent part of the main story and are generally small and pretty light on things to do. So why even have these unlockable vehicles if theres nowhere fun to drive them?', 'My biggest disappointment with Lego Batman 3 is its inconsistent tone. The developers definitely love the source material, but there are moments where they take a substantial step away from familiar franchise turf to introduce elements that immediately start to erode the fun of being in the world of the comics.', 'When Braniac comes to Earth, we dont get to battle him in iconic DC locations like Smallville, Gorilla City, or Paradise Island; No, Braniac just terrorizes Paris or Pisa.  Shortly after that, you spend the final third of the story missions on a sort of sci-fi tour through unfamiliar Lantern worlds, which is kind of a letdown.', 'I also have to question the decision to include these annoying cameos. Instead of DCs quintessential everyman Jimmy Olsen, this games ubiquitous hanger-on is Conan OBrien. Hes all over the place, repeating the same gags every time you see him. After a while, making jokes about how there are no Labradors in the Batcave laboratory gets kind of old. You even end up spending quite a bit of time with Daffy Duck as Green Loontern, which, again, kills the mood for me. Yes, I get it; its a game where Cyborg can fool a security camera by turning into a washing machine, but theres a difference between making a joke about the characters and just surrounding them with other stuff that also happens to be part of the Warner Bros. empire.', '(I didnt have as much of a problem with the inclusion of references to the Batman TV show because that, at least, seems to make some sense within Lego Batman 3s world  and unlike Daffy Duck, Adam West isnt hanging around the Watchtower talking about space the whole time.)']",IGN
125,Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric,14-Nov-14,Mikel Reparaz,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/14/sonic-boom-the-rise-of-lyric-review,"['What\'s the single most defining characteristic of a Sonic the Hedgehog game? If your answer is ""speed,"" expect to feel cheated about three minutes into Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric, when a high-velocity sprint through a linear jungle track suddenly gives way to repetitive robot-punching and plodding exploration. It\'s jarring, and it\'s an immediate reminder that Rise of Lyric isnt a traditional Sonic game so much as its a licensed platformer based on the Cartoon Network show. Its gameplay more closely resembles an off-brand Ratchet & Clank  and while that doesn\'t automatically condemn it , Rise of Lyric is so aggressively mediocre that slowing Sonic down is really the least of its sins.', ""It's still a pretty big sin, though. Rise of Lyric  which tasks Sonic, Knuckles, Amy Rose, and Tails with halting a robot apocalypse engineered by Lyric, a cackling and utterly forgettable cyborg snake  relegates high-speed running to just one of several gameplay types, and pares it down to mostly linear skyways where your input is limited to collecting rings, dodging hazards, and simply watching as you're bounced between jump pads or funneled through loops. These sequences can be awfully pretty (when they're not bogged down by choppy animation or visual clutter), and despite their lack of interactivity, they're a fun, breezy change of pace  as well as the only place Sonic's signature speed is on display."", 'The rest of Rise of Lyric is split into simple brawling, open-world exploration, and linear puzzle-platforming stages that frequently shift to a 2D viewpoint. None of these move faster than jogging speed, but they do let you switch between the four protagonists at will, using their unique abilities to navigate character-specific obstacles. Amy, for example, has a triple-jump that makes her a more agile explorer than Sonic, and she can run and swing on glowing pink balancing beams. Knuckles can climb ruby-encrusted walls, Tails can float and send out little robots to shut down otherwise inaccessible machinery, and Sonic can spin-dash to zoom up curved ramps or bounce between hovering orbs. Rise of Lyric does a decent job of making sure you have plenty of opportunities to use these abilities.', ""The heroes get a lot less distinct during Rise of Lyric's fights, however. Combat is simple; Everyone has a single attack combo, as well as a midair stomp, a charged attack, and an energy tether that can lasso and throw enemies around. The combat's simplicity wouldn't be so bad if it were woven more naturally into exploration; instead, most of it unfolds in Devil May Cry-esque arenas, meaning robots attack in waves and you can't move on until they're all in pieces. It quickly becomes a chore, and usually boils down to either frantically mashing a single button while dodging poorly telegraphed attacks, or laboriously dragging robots to you with the tether (which rarely targeted the enemies I wanted it to) and hurling them off cliffs."", ""It's not particularly challenging, either. The heroes have a shared pool of rings that act as their collective health meter, and while these are capped at 100, every environment in Rise of Lyric is filled to bursting with the things. Should you actually die, you'll just respawn nearby, with your enemies just as weakened as you left them. This cuts down any potential frustration, but it also strips out any trace of actual difficulty, meaning you're free to simply hurl yourself against enemies until they're all dead."", ""Finally, theres the open-world gameplay, which consists of two huge hub-world villages. These are fun to explore at first, but apart from item-revealing construction projects and a handful of NPCs who want you to pursue inane side quests (like finding hidden herbs, or activating magical defense towers), they're pretty empty, and crossing their vast expanses of bland scenery quickly gets tedious. Being able to run fast would've been a big help here, but depressingly, it's not even an option."", ""Bringing in a second player makes things a little more fun, and it's handled smartly; one player uses the GamePad's screen, the other gets the TV and a controller, and both players get separate stocks of rings. Interestingly, the two-screen approach lets you simultaneously play through areas where the heroes split up (with player two visible in the background of the GamePad screen), although it doesn't come into play at all during the Team Challenges, a set of separate, local-only multiplayer modes that confine up to four players to one fixed camera angle in enjoyably frantic, combat-focused minigames. These are a definite bright spot, and feature scenarios  like a battle on top of the engines of a continually digging subterranean drill  that are far more imaginative than anything in the story."", 'Throughout its six-to-eight-hour runtime, Rise of Lyric is further dragged down by nearly every aspect of its presentation. Its heroes animate relatively well, but they also never shut up, continually tossing out banal one-liners that range from cheerful encouragements to excruciating ""not!"" jokes. The script is never ashamed to embrace drab cliches rehashed from seemingly every show aimed at kids (""I know your weakness, Sonic. It\'s your friends!"" "" They\'re not my weakness. They\'re my strength!""). It\'s also not short on technical issues, beginning with a finicky, sluggish camera and extending to frequently choppy animation, long load times, noticeable hangs during transitions between different areas of open environments, and even occasional crashes.']",IGN
126,Valkyria Chronicles,26-Nov-14,Mikel Reparaz,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/26/valkyria-chronicles-pc-review,"[""If you've been wondering what XCOM would be like with anime sensibilities and an alternate-reality World War II conceit, well, you have a pretty active imagination. You probably also haven't played Valkyria Chronicles, but don't feel too bad  lots of people haven't, even though this vibrant tactical RPG has amassed a cult following since it debuted on PlayStation 3 six years ago. If you missed it the first time, the long-overdue PC port is a great way to correct that mistake: it's just as beautiful, challenging, and involving as the original."", ""Re-imagining World War II as a fantasy-tinged clash between a sinister, vaguely German empire and the scrappy little country of Gallia, Valkyria focuses on a single militia squad fighting small-scale battles in a much bigger war. It shares a few similarities with XCOM  turn-based combat, distinct heroes divided into classes, and a base where you can research new equipment and level up troops between missions, to name a few  but it infuses its battles with shooter elements, letting you freely move individual soldiers and aim their shots. You're limited only by their Action Points  actually a meter that shrinks as you move  and their ability to snap off just one attack per move. And while enemies can't move during your turn, they'll open fire if your active soldier is in range (unless he or she is aiming, which is weird), making quick reflexes almost as vital as strategic thinking to keeping your troops alive. Quickly aiming or exiting a move to keep a soldier from being shot at feels strange and artificial at first, but eventually Valkyria's unusual combat rhythms become second nature."", ""That's not to undersell the importance of strategy, though. Valkyria's 30-odd missions (including non-story skirmishes and side missions) are elaborate, smartly designed, and frequently pit you against seemingly impossible odds and unique threats that include giant supertanks, indestructible machine gun nests, and a gauntlet of mines and searchlights that you'll have to navigate while injured. Careful pre-mission squad selection, teamwork, and creative thinking are all encouraged. You might, for example, endlessly hammer a powerful enemy with your Lancer rocket troops, only to realize that it's a better idea to simply group your lighter troops closer together so they all lay down supporting fire when one of them is actively shooting."", ""Sudden realizations like that can lead to some incredibly satisfying victories, but in the meantime, mistakes are costly. Not only does correcting them eat into your limited supply of moves per turn, but errors tend to get your troops shot down  and if an enemy reaches them before you can, they'll die for good. All this risk adds up to some incredibly satisfying victories, but it also leads to a lot of frustration in the meantime  particularly if you realize, halfway through a long and grueling battle, that you've been pursuing a wrongheaded strategy the whole time, or left yourself totally unprepared for a second-stage surprise attack. There's also no auto-saving or checkpoints, although you can save manually at any time, which lets you create little safety nets before risky moves. On the other hand, if you don't remember to save frequently, failure could fling you right back to the mission's start. Valkyria is not for rage-quitters."", 'Outside of combat, Valkyria puts an enormous emphasis on story and character. Each recruitable squad member has their own personality, backstory, and idiosyncrasies, from head-in-the-clouds student-turned-tank commander Welkin Gunther, to panic-prone would-be actress Edy Nelson. Individual quirks can also affect their combat prowess: someone with a pollen allergy will lose health if they get too close to plants, for example, while characters identified as ""city kids"" will have higher defense when standing on paved roads. Practically speaking, these are really just brief, barely noticeable bonuses or debuffs (except for extreme cases, like a pacifist arbitrarily refusing an order to shoot), but they\'re a neat touch nonetheless.', ""The downside of the heavy focus on story is that it translates into tons of lengthy cutscenes, most of which are just conversations between talking heads. Thankfully, many of them are fun or at least interesting to watch, especially if you're invested in the characters and how they develop over Valkyria's 30-40-hour runtime  and odds are you will be, because Valkyria manages to wring some unexpectedly emotional moments out of what at first seems like a fairly formulaic war story. However, it's not unusual to have to sit through 10-15 minutes of cutscenes before and after missions, and that quickly leads to a feeling that you're watching more than you're playing  particularly at the beginning, when Valkyria intersperses short tutorial skirmishes with piles of non-interactive dialogue and character exposition."", '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', ""Of course, all this is old news to you if you've already played Valkyria on PS3, so let's cut to the chase: this is a mostly stellar port. Visually, it looks amazing; the pencil-shaded anime visuals that were so striking at 720p look even more beautiful running on higher resolutions at 60 frames per second, though, the pre-rendered cutscenes are reportedly fixed at 720p. Keyboard and mouse controls are supported and work great (especially when piloting Valkyria's awkward tanks), and I ended up using them in tandem with an Xbox 360 controller, employing thumbsticks for movement and the mouse to smoothly line up headshots. The controller also felt more natural for navigating Valkyria's menus, which annoyingly don't take advantage of the mouse. Perhaps best of all, load times are lightning-fast compared to the PS3 version, so while you may have to wade through a lot of dialogue before combat, you at least won't have long to wait once the talking stops.""]",IGN
127,Escape Dead Island,17-Nov-14,Scott Butterworth,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/17/escape-dead-island-review,"['Escape Dead Island has a bit of a commitment problem: every time it starts to flirt with greatness, it suddenly pulls back. The combat, the story, the exploration -- every major component surprised and engaged me at some point, but inevitably, each stopped just short of doing something truly memorable. As a result, Im left reaching for words like fine and nice instead of inventive and bold. Despite this untapped potential, however, Escape is indeed a decent game with a enough narrative twists and compelling collectibles to make for an enjoyable if somewhat underdeveloped experience.', 'In some respects, Escape actually feels more like a tropical, zombie-infused version of 2012s Spec Ops: The Line than its namesake. In place of Dead Islands first-person perspective, sandbox map structure, four-player co-op, and multi-protagonist storyline, Escape opts for third-person single-player action as it guides us through the linear though intricately layered mental collapse of its lead character, spoiled rich-kid and chronic underachiever Cliff Calo...or does it?', 'On the surface, the story is an eye roll-inducing checklist of routine survival-horror cliches  a shipwrecked group of kids, a zombie-virus-infected love interest, a vaguely evil corporation, etc  but to Escapes credit, theyre at least well-executed cliches. Theres enough playful banter early on to make the characters feel human, for example, and important revelations are spaced just far enough apart to keep the underlying mystery enticing. Plus, the entire ordeal is wrapped in something far more intriguing: Cliffs apparent march towards insanity.', 'Like Spec Ops, Escape loves to toy with our perception of what were actually seeing and playing, occasionally injecting opaque dialogue and surreal moments that fundamentally challenge our notions of reality in a gaming context. Remember those shipping containers raining from the sky in the trailer? Yeah, that. Those mess-with-your-head moments (which Ill try not to ruin here) were easily the most addictive aspect of the whole experience.', 'Unfortunately, Cliff spirals downwards a little too slowly, with only brief flashes of instability once every few hours in the early portions of the campaign. He does eventually go entirely off the rails -- and the ensuing insanity pretty much singlehandedly validates Escapes existence -- but even once the environments start to become twisted manifestations of Cliffs guilt and insecurities, hes still basically just fighting the same old zombies. So while the insanity angle as a whole is a huge plus, it doesnt have the support of interesting game mechanics behind it.', 'Those good old zombie disposal mechanics dont go quite far enough either. At the outset of the campaign, Escape does a decent impression of a survival-horror game: Zombies can kill Cliff much faster than Cliff can kill zombies; hes armed with only two makeshift weapons; and environmental objects like FM radios can be used as distractions to avoid combat. By the end, however, Cliffs shotgunning his way through an endless army of various undead abominations.', 'Perhaps due to a lack of commitment to either style of play, both the survival and combat elements are just, well... fine. Enemies are too dumb to be particularly threatening alone -- which essentially eliminates the stomach-churning dread you should experience when encountering an enemy in a horror game -- and the two-button, melee-centric combat is pretty no-frills: mash attack, dodge when necessary. There are no wacky weapons, and no deep, involving upgrades. Its entertaining enough to fill the gaps between plot points, but itll never be my go-to choice when I feel like slaying some zombies.', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', 'That said, I actually spent nearly as much time hunting collectibles as I did hunting zombies, which helped ease the gameplay load away from the ho-hum combat. Cliff, like Dead Risings Frank West, is avid photographer, and the lush island of Narapela contains over 80 unique photo ops, as well as a host of more expected collectibles like audio logs, experiment data, and postcards. All that reading material rewards you with little pieces of backstory  and as anyone who accidentally got addicted to Pokemon Snap back in the day knows, remembering to whip out your camera for those special short-lived moments is its own reward.', 'Be warned, though: Escape subscribes to the Metroidvania school of level design, meaning youll endure a fair amount of backtracking through its discrete, interconnected areas as you acquire new gear (yes, you can eventually enter the Lost-esque hatch you find on the first beach). I spent a solid 20 hours working my way through the campaign, but I probably could have powered through the main story in half that time. Fortunately, the consistently excellent soundtrack created a palpable tension that made all that exploration feel like it was building towards some creepy revelation... even if I was just taking pictures of crates.']",IGN
128,Pro Evolution Soccer 2015,14-Nov-14,Chris Schilling,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/14/pro-evolution-soccer-2015-review,"['There was one moment during my time with it that I knew that old PES sparkle was back, and it wasnt a sumptuous strike or a slick piece of build-up play. It wasnt a spectacular save, nor a thrilling goalmouth scramble. It was a near miss.', ""Picture the scene: its a pulsating Serie A encounter between Juventus and Roma, played under floodlights on a dark, wintry evening. The game is enticingly poised at one apiece. Arturo Vidal jabs his boot forward to regain possession just inside his own half, and plays a simple square ball to Andrea Pirlo. He chips it forward: its a classic Pirlo wedge shot, aimed towards rangy frontman Fernando Llorente. It's Pirlo, so the ball's almost perfect; Llorente backs up, glancing at his marker, who unexpectedly climbs early and just about gets his head to it first. Carlos Tevez anticipates the loose ball, automatically backing up slightly to receive it as it drops. Hes around 35 yards out, and I glance at the radar to see the opposition goalkeeper a little way off his line. Tevez chests it down, and it sits up beautifully on the bounce."", ""I cant possibly resist, and squeeze the square button, releasing just before the gauge reaches full power. The balls trajectory takes it quite high, but Tevez has hit it with topspin. The 'keeper, clearly not expecting a shot from range, backpedals desperately towards his goal as it comes down. He stretches out his fingertips, even though he knows he's not getting close to the ball. Yet he's in luck: it drops just over the crossbar, grazing it on the way, before rolls over the top of the net. The fans hold their heads in their hands and I follow suit."", ""I cant remember the last time I enjoyed not scoring in a football game quite so much as this. PES 2015 can still be a little rigid in places, but I've not experienced anything close to that moment with EA Sports equivalent, FIFA 15. This year, the pitch is ours is developer Konamis mantra. This year, the pitch is accurate."", 'Firstly, lets highlight the area in which PES compares most favourably to its biggest rival. Its no exaggeration to say that the artificial intelligence here is some of the finest Ive encountered in any sports simulation. The fact that it will go unnoticed by some is perhaps the biggest compliment you can pay it; its perhaps more starkly noticeable to me because of its apparent absence in FIFA. Here, wing-backs offer themselves on the overlap; midfielders drop back when possession is lost; defenders step out to play strikers offside; keepers sprint from their boxes to clear lofted through balls just before the opposition centre forward can lash it goalward. Mistakes happen, but theyre rare, and more commonly attributed to your own errors. Its important because it means that any time you lose the ball, any time you concede a goal, its hard to blame anyone but yourself.', 'You wont just see that intelligence in your own teammates, either. If a full-back gets a yellow card, you can bet a smart opponent will try to exploit that booking, focusing their sorties down that side of the pitch. If youve got a slow centre-back pairing, then youll see plenty of attempts to play pacy strikers in behind you, either via slide-rule through-balls or high passes aimed into space. Youll need to identify not just your opponents strengths and weaknesses, but your own, plugging gaps, and modifying your attacking style.', 'Theres no one sure-fire way to win, and while there are a few sweet spots (a corner hit with just above medium power into that corridor of uncertainty between keeper and defence was quite a reliable source of goals for me) youll rarely be able to rely on the same tactic twice. Opponents do seem to adapt, too: after scoring from two swift, direct counter-attacks as Real Madrid, Liverpool managed to cut off Cristiano Ronaldos supply line, and it took a scrappy last-minute deflected strike before he earned the match ball.', 'Pace and stamina matter, too. Youll be able to rely on feints and trickery on occasion, but changes in direction and sudden bursts of speed are more likely to get you past your man. Sprinting at full tilt will usually get you tackled, but with wingers like Navas and Stirling, holding the ball before suddenly accelerating is the way to get you that extra yard of space to fizz in a cross. Your strikers will anticipate this, waving their arms as they pull away from their markers and move into the box ready to receive the ball. Runs are best used judiciously, too, as theyre the only way youll conserve enough stamina to stay efficient for the full 90 minutes. Opponents tire too, of course, so its not particularly noticeable until the later stages. Bring on fresh legs  particularly when you pit a nippy forward against a labouring defender - and youll be able to see the difference. Its rewarding to see substitutions having such a tangible impact.', 'As a result of all this, not to mention the ability to more effectively control the pace of the game by putting your foot on the ball, PES is simultaneously predictable and unpredictable. Its predictable in the very best sense of the word: in that you learn to read certain strategies over time, to grow accustomed to a teams idiosyncrasies, to react to changes in personnel and tactics  even to instinctively know where the ball will end up when you release a pass or let fly with a shot. And its unpredictable in the right way, too: in that you can never rest on your laurels, in that the game unfolds organically, and theres no single sure-fire route to success.', 'Elsewhere, PESs much-touted myClub feels like a direct challenge to EA Sports. Its an online-focused mode that invites you to build a squad from a team of no-hopers to genuine contenders, and if it takes plenty of cues from Ultimate Team, it makes for a solid, familiar structure. Theres a fine art to assembling a squad with a positive team spirit: youll need to recruit both the right manager and the sort of players who are a good tactical fit for their chosen style of play. Only then will you see the pitchs heat map redden, denoting a stronger chemistry; its a slightly clumsier way of doing things than its rival, which makes everything a little more transparent, but the nuts and bolts of it work just fine.', 'Theres an interesting wrinkle, too, in the form of agents: the more you gain from completed matches - thus encouraging you not to quit before the full-time whistle blows - the more youll increase the likelihood of you signing your dream player. You can make things easier for yourself with day-one bonuses, while the rush of points youll earn from completing objectives for the first time  from chipped passes to rainbow flicks to goals  may be enough to unlock galacticos. I managed to nab both Andres Iniesta and Gareth Bale before my third match, both selected from what essentially amounts to a wheel of fortune. In other words, youre once again beholden to the whims of the RNG, but at least everyones in the same boat.', 'You can grease the wheels by paying real money for PESs other currency, myClub coins, though this feature wasnt available at the time of writing. With bonuses for daily play and regular top-ups for in-game achievements, these seem a less egregious form of microtransaction than most, even if the mode itself is essentially Ultimate Team under a different name. Yet it lacks the polish and immediacy of its big-money counterpart, spoiled by a lacklustre user interface and a few baffling design choices. The process of adding new players into your squad is particularly confusing, the feeble tutorial forgetting to tell you that you need to release or deregister a current player first. Still, its had more attention paid to it than the rather bare-bones Master League option, a series mainstay that looks increasingly creaky in light of the competition.', 'The real acid test, however, comes with online play. Its an area in which Konami has historically struggled, but Im cautiously optimistic that the publisher has finally got things right. Its early days yet, and perhaps this will change when the servers fill up, but I rarely had to wait long to find a game, and lag was either light or absent when I did. Ive always felt PES was at its best as a couch-based multiplayer game, but its heartening to see such a robust online component.', 'Its certainly more than enough to compensate for those remaining few off-pitch flaws, and for the continued shortfall when it comes to licensed content. Konami, seemingly aware it can no longer compete in that regard  even with a wealth of official international tournaments  has instead decided to play to its strengths. If its impossible to dismiss the allure of authentic chants, stadia, team names, and kits, its telling that PES 2015 is intrinsically rewarding enough not to require those hooks. Strip away the fripperies and theres a clear winner  and this year, for once, it isnt EA Sports.']",IGN

Until the end credits, not a single line of dialog is written or spoken at any point, and that lack of traditional language forces it away from conventional storytelling techniques. Instead, A Bird Story is told visually, relying on subtle animations, and deliberate art design to craft an effective and evocative narrative.', 'The main character in A Bird Story is a young boy whose imagination often leaves him at odds with the world around him, and every visual moment has been crafted to reflect this. Throughout the entire game, only his character and two others ever have completely formed sprites with recognizable faces. All other people in A Bird Story are near-transparent shadows, suggesting that the boy doesnt interact or relate to them, instead seeing through or around them in his loneliness. Hes often pulled away by his creative tendencies and need for self-expression, but his shyness prevents him from doing so around others.', 'This very shyness is illustrated through subtle, yet effective moments. When sharing the elevator in his apartment building with another tenant, he is shown taking a tiny sidestep away from them before reaching his floor. At the start, he can step right through the other children in school, treating them like invisible beings rather than friends or even tangible peers. Theyre all small moments, but completely effective in silently providing some insight into the boys personality.', 'After rescuing and forming a bond with an injured bird, the world around the boy begins to change in subtle, yet powerful ways. Whereas colors are initially a bit more monochromatic in their use of greys and browns, they grow more brilliant and abundant as the boy and the birds relationship develops. He begins to notice the people around him and even interacts more freely with others. Genuinely funny and heartfelt moments take place throughout, all working seamlessly together to create a commentary on the importance of friendships and the pain inherent in letting go.', 'Music and audible cues also play a major role in the storytelling, often setting the tone and helping bolster the emotion in different scenes. Using light, airy piano riffs, varied guitar chords, and a wide array of woodwind and string instruments, the music is poignant and evocative without ever crossing into cheesy or undeserved territory. Kan Gaos music serves as a necessary co-narrator to A Bird Storys unique pixelated visuals.', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', 'Advertisement', 'Much of the game is spent watching things unfold and merely guiding a character around using the directional and space buttons on the keyboard to navigate and interact with the world. Its also a short game  perhaps two hours long at the most  and it never allows for any sort of exploration or wandering.  None of this is necessarily a negative, however.

New developer Sumo Digital created an enormous puzzle-platformer with equally enormous scope for creation and an enjoyable single-player experience; however, it is undermined by unimaginative co-op and a number of game-breaking bugs."", 'First things first: for anybody worried that the absence of original LittleBigPlanet developer Media Molecule might mean an absence of the series signature charm, fear not. From its title sequence - narrated by the reliably delightful Stephen Fry - onward, LittleBigPlanet 3s style is a wonderful brew of humor and effervescence, and its central message of play, create, share is thankfully continued, in both tone and structure.', '\n', 'There is more emphasis on story this time around, though. All the supporting characters in LittleBigPlanet 3 are now voiced, and cutscenes tell of an animated attack on the magnificent moon of wonder planet called Bunkam that has sucked away its inhabitants creativity. While I was initially wary that more traditional video game storytelling might feel out of place in a world that has always delighted in the surreal, I found LittleBigPlanets simple narrative unobtrusive and fun, and its characters idiosyncratically weird.', 'Individual story levels in LittleBigPlanets seven- to eight-hour Adventure mode are beautifully designed. Where LittleBigPlanet 2s aesthetic is all neon and electricity, the look this time around has been modeled after the stage and screen. Levels take place in abstract renditions of 50s monster movie sets and ballet performances, marionette theaters and workshops, all with that familiar LittleBigPlanet overlay of an artsy design magazine and a killer soundtrack. The three new story-mode hubs  explorable, sprawling worlds in their own right  are just as gorgeous; the Eastern European-Christmas-themed Ziggurat Hub is one of the more romantic places Ive ever visited in a video game.', 'Although LittleBigPlanet 3 still occasionally suffers from the same floaty controls bucking up against some level designs that demand very precise platforming, these story levels  and optional challenge levels  are imaginative enough that I could (mostly) forgive the issue. Its thanks to a handful of great new additions that gameplay is more frenetic than in the past two games; the Portal-esque Velociporter, for example, can send Sackboy from the background to the foreground in a blink; while new powerups such as Boost Boots and the teleporting Blink Ball gun open up new ways to bounce across the screen.', '\n', 'LittleBigPlanet 3s cuddly new characters add a unique dynamic to gameplay, although its disappointing - and surprising, considering the pre-launch marketing - how little they are actually used. While Swoop (who can fly and grab), Oddsock (who can run fast and bounce off walls) and Toggle (who can switch between being heavy and light) each get to headline a level upon introduction, they are only intermittently used elsewhere in Adventure mode. Seeing how much fun playing as these characters is, this feels like a missed opportunity.', 'Limited use of the broader cast extends to cooperative play, as LittleBigPlanet 3 curiously insists you and your co-op partner(s) have to play as the the same character in individual levels. I found only one instance where this was not that case, and that particular level was so cleverly orchestrated, utilizing all skillsets in a frantic race against the clock, I am dumbfounded there werent more like it. Even more confusing is why that standout level would be hidden away, where many people might miss it altogether.', 'But the most damning aspect of Adventure mode, and LittleBigPlanet 3 as a whole, is the number of bugs I encountered while playing it. Across two PlayStation 4 systems, my (already patched) game encountered frequent frame rate stuttering, crashed multiple times and glitched out so I couldnt respawn after dying. I fell through levels into floaty purgatory twice, and some of the plentiful loading screens became stuck. Twice during a boss chase, my co-op partner and I were left stranded after spawning mid-way through the level, because the level hadnt reset itself. Again, this is with the zero-day patch installed.', 'Fortunately, perhaps because it operates at a much slower pace, I had no such issues with LittleBigPlanet 3s Creation Mode. Here, Sumo Digital has stood on the shoulders of giants, leaving Media Molecules (relatively) accessible, yet hefty LittleBigPlanet 2 toolkit intact, and adding a handful of significant upgrades that promises greater sophistication in level-building.', 'You can now create in 16 layers. Weaned on LittleBigPlanet 2s comparably simple three layers, I found this initially daunting and awkward, but after a few hours of playing in level creator I got the gist  if not the hang of  the new depth of field. Its telling that despite hours worth of mortifyingly terrible attempts at creating a decent-looking level with proper depth, I want to go back and play with it some more.', 'Elsewhere, the Blaster Handle, which allows you to imagine your own power ups, has enormous potential, as does the quietly revelatory Popit Powerup. This tool is responsible for LittleBigPlanet 3s Popit Academy: 12 platforming levels designed to teach you Creation Mode basics. These levels essentially blur the line between create and play by tasking you to solve puzzles using your creation toolkit. They are fun and cleverly designed  in fact, I enjoyed a handful of them more than some of the Adventure mode levels  and suggest a paradigm shift for how we could play user-generated levels moving forward.', 'Such additions promise to open up LittleBigPlanets world significantly, and as we know from the nine million-plus user-generated levels included from previous games on the disc (thats an impressive amount of DLC), there will be no shortage of people to take advantage of them. Its exciting to watch as a new LittleBigPlanet game is let loose into the wild, and wonder how it might be pulled apart, put back together, and blown up in the future.']",IGN
131,Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth,20-Nov-14,Meghan Sullivan,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/20/persona-q-shadow-of-the-labyrinth-review,"['Some things just go well together: peas and carrots, peanut butter and chocolate, Persona and Etrian Odyssey. In Persona Q, developer Atlus has managed to successfully blend together two popular RPG series to create a fun, challenging dungeon crawler featuring buckets of Persona fan service, enjoyable turn-based combat, and cunningly laid-out dungeons.', 'My absolute favorite thing about Persona Q is the love it shows to long-time Persona fans like myself. I loved watching the casts of Persona 3 and 4 fight side by side, trade quips, and share profound moments. Whether it was Teddy making clumsy passes at the girls, Kanji and Ken bonding over shoelaces, or escorting the Velvet Room sisters Elizabeth and Margaret, there were lots of funny, and touching moments throughout the 60 plus hours I spent with the adorable cast.', 'Deciding whether to play as the main character from Persona 3 or Persona 4 was a tough decision, since they both have their own skills and merits, but having to choose creates a great incentive to go back and play again just to see all the different dialogue options. I was a little disappointed that the main story puts the spotlight entirely on newcomers Rei and Zen instead of familiar cast members, though. Thats not to say the story is bad, or that the new characters arent interesting, but it took way too long to find out who Zen and Rei were and why helping them through a long series of dungeons would allow the Persona teams to escape their imprisonment at Yasogami High.', 'Itd be much more of an issue if those labyrinths werent such fun to delve into, but they are, courtesy of Persona Qs Etrian Odyssey-like style of dungeon exploration. I felt like a true explorer as I navigated puzzle-filled floors, and I even busted out a pen and paper to jot down things like the locations of hidden passages, treasure chests, and puzzle hints that would allow me to bypass Herculean enemies called FOEs. Using my brain to progress, instead of forcing my way through hordes of enemies, felt good, but there were times when my patience started to fray. Sometimes, I was forced to spend hours searching for clues to a dungeon puzzle, or tiptoeing around FOEs determined to block my progress. That meant stretches of fighting the same enemies over and over again, which got to be pretty repetitive. On the other hand, I felt incredibly smart whenever I managed to finish one of Persona Qs immense labyrinths.', 'Of course, having good travel music is essential on a long journey like this, and Persona Q has it in spades. Its a fantastic mix of familiar tunes, like the Velvet Room theme from both Persona 3 and 4, and rockin new songs like Maze of Life and Light the Fire up in the Night. There were actually times when I would stop exploring just to listen to my favorite tracks.', 'Exploration is fun, but the combat in Persona Q is even better. On the surface its very much like Etrian Odyssey: its fought with five-member squads arranged in two rows. I really liked this, because it allowed me to put physically weaker characters like Naoto and Yukiko in the back row so they could use elemental attacks without taking too much damage, while putting stronger characters like Shoji and Kanij out front where they could absorb blows and physically beat down enemies.  But whats really great is how Personas distinct brand of combat has been cleverly woven together with Etrian Odysseys, which gives Persona Q a flavor thats similar to both series, but also distinct and new.', 'Not only do characters use their normal Personas to battle shadows, but they can equip one additional Persona that will give them extra abilities and raise their health and skill points. Plus, by using the Leader Skill, I could have either Fuuka or Rise use their special navigation skills to heal the party or speed up a characters turn. These new features gave me a wonderful array of ways to change up my battle tactics and exploit enemy weaknesses. Its a good thing too, since even basic enemies in Persona Q are tough customers.', 'Persona Q takes a page right from Etrian Odysseys playbook by dealing out lots of knock-down, drag out fights. I never found them cheap or completely unfair, but more than once I was wiped out by either a single FOE who caught me unaware, or a powerful group of enemies that could kill my entire party in just a few quick turns. Its definitely not impossible: by equipping the right equipment and the right Persona types, I was able to overcome everything from hard-hitting FOEs to super-tough dungeon bosses. And my hard work was always rewarded with new Persona cards and rare items.']",IGN
132,Assassins Creed Rogue,15-Nov-14,Daniel Krupa,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/15/assassins-creed-rogue-review,"[""History has always played a pivotal role in the Assassins Creed series. It serves as both inspiration and backdrop  a resource for dramatic events, supporting characters, and villains. Rogue is slightly different, though; its more concerned with examining the history of the series itself than exploring real-life events. The result is one of the most striking and intriguing stories seen in an Assassin's Creed game, but forgettable missions, an empty world, and lack of effort to put a new spin on how this long-running series plays and controls continually undermine its dramatic intentions."", '\n', 'Rogues greatest strength is its central character  Shay Patrick Cormac  and his journey from dutiful Assassin to vengeful Templar. Most of the trailers surrounding Rogue have portrayed Shay as a cold-blooded killer, but thats in no way accurate; his story is nuanced, and the narrative is patiently unfolded. You play the first third or so of Rogue as an Assassin, which lets you forge relationships with those you will later hunt. Theres a good chunk of the 14-hour campaign where Shay doesnt have any clear allegiances, and even then, he never really descends into brutal killer territory. Theres always a sympathetic motivation to be found; its all much more nuanced and ambiguous than I was expecting, and it makes for the most engaging story in an Assassins Creed game since the days of Ezio Auditore da Firenze.', ""Rogue also attempts to transfer the crisis of faith Shay experiences to us, and for me it worked. Familiar faces and locations from each of the past Assassin's Creed games are thrown up and put in some sort of order, but the perspective of those events we know is either changed or challenged. Shay isnt a villain; hes an individual, who questions orders and suspects inherited truths, and for the first time in the series we are encouraged to do the same. Rogue is great because it does away with the idea of black-and-white villains at all.\n"", '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', ""This adds a renewed level of intrigue to what is a very familiar Assassins Creed experience of running across rooftops, freeing hostages, sabotaging the enemy, and of course, killing important people. I was hoping some of this would feel different playing as Shay the Templar, but disappointingly there are no new abilities to distinguish. Since he was trained as an Assassin, its bloody business as usual. And when the time came to confront my former Assassin brothers and sisters, what should've been dramatic moments were revealed as forgettably staged and mechanically bland."", 'In both good ways and bad, Rogue plays like a direct sequel to Black Flag, and carries on its strong emphasis on seafaring. The map sends us around Albany, New York, the frozen waters of the North Atlantic, as well as plenty of small towns and quaint settlements, like the pumpkin-strewn Sleepy Hollow, dotted around. Even though it can be on occasion a bit fuzzy around the edges with some dodgy shading, Rogue is a frequently pretty experience. Sailing through blizzards while your ship cuts through the ice looks great and is thrilling.', '\n', ""But for all of its good looks and atmosphere, I cant help but find Rogues world lacking. Yes, it looks big on a map, apparently crammed with things to do  forts to conquer, animals to hunt, territory to explore  but I cant stress how extraneous all of these activities are. For example, I only lightly upgraded my ship, and managed to easily finish the campaign without ever tending to Shays equipment. Consequently, there's just no reason to spend time hunting; there's no benefit."", ""And I feel the same about the icons and question marks dotted around its sprawling map: they're just not that interesting, and if you do explore, the pay-off rarely justifies the excursion. As a result, Rogue feels deceptive; it appears to be generous, but it's not. And because it's a world that doesn't reward curiosity, either with fun or material gain, I finished Shay's story without really getting to know the cities of Albany or New York, and used fast travel whenever possible. Over the years Assassins Creed has acquired so many systems  hunting, urban renewal, myriad collectibles  but unlike a savvy pirate, its reluctant to jettison them for the good of the mission."", '\n', ""Sadly, for a game so focussed on reappraising the past, Rogues core combat and traversal mechanics remain unimproved, and as with every Assassin's Creed game before it, at times I found them painfully frustrating. There are several missions which involve you taking out a series of guards in wide-open environments, but rarely did I feel like a skilled assassin as I jumped into a campfire by accident or like a seasoned captain of a ship as I jumped into the bay of a harbour instead of its pier. This is all frustrating  or if you're in a good mood, a touch comical  but when it ruins key moments in the story, I found it unforgivable.""]",IGN

Because it's largely identical across both platforms, the original review still applies and is summarized here in the verdict. This review focuses on the PC version's unique features.]"", 'Planning a turn in Frozen Synapse Prime provides the same inexplicable joy of meticulously setting dominoes on end, only to watch them topple in a fraction of the time it took to arrange them. Aside from its ability to reliably accommodate a staggering array of tactics, Primes greatest asset is the glorious tension of that moment when you bite your nails, flick the first domino, and wonder, Is this actually going to work? That consistent satisfaction makes this an excellent tactics game.', '', '', 'Naturally, the PC version of Frozen Synapse Prime retains all the interface improvements, campaign smoothing, and gameplay additions (like tutorials and killcams) outlined above, but it also adds Arenas -- five brand- new, highly- specific multiplayer scenarios, each with its own unique hook. Chasm, for example, locks each team in a confined space that doesnt allow units in or out, turning each match into a bizarre but tense whack-a-mole standoff as each commander attempts to pick off his opponents soldiers through strategically placed windows.', 'The other four modes remix existing game elements in similar ways, cleverly creating experiences that feel fresh despite reusing all the same key ingredients found in every other mode. And if youd rather stick with the traditional randomly generated multiplayer matches, Prime PC still effortlessly allows you to juggle multiple matches by backing out to the multiplayer menu and attending to whatever on-going matches require your immediate attention.', '', '', 'Obviously the PC version loses the Vitas excellently implemented touch controls, but the mouse/keyboard combo once again proves to be the most precise and efficient way to play. The space bar opens the command wheel, commands are mapped to the number keys, the mouse scroll wheel zooms the camera in and out -- the whole setup is so intuitive I didnt even have to think before clicking after the first few rounds. Prime PC also offers controller support (as well as Steam Achievements and Trading Cards, of course), but seriously, stick with the keyboard.', 'Even on PC (where many hardened fans still play the original Frozen Synapse), Prime really is the definitive version of an already excellent game. Every update is thoughtful and thorough, bolstering the core experience without compromising anything. The graphics might be grayer, but every other aspect is stronger, even if only slightly.']",IGN

In The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, a rare balance is struck where its brutal bullet-hell difficulty isnt a punishment, but an opportunity to see something totally new. Because of excellent randomization and seemingly endless content, Im still seeing items, bosses, and entirely new types of dungeons even after 30 hours of intense twin-stick shooter-style battle. And, every so often, I pause for a moment and appreciate that Im playing as a traumatized, naked child whos destroying poop monsters and zombie babies by crying on them because his crazy mother tried to kill him. So its something we can all relate to.', 'While its randomized maps and collectable hearts, keys, and bombs resemble the dungeons of the original Legend of Zelda, the skills involved in surviving here are more about mastering your tear projectiles, which are are affected by your momentum at the moment you fire them. That enables a surprising depth in trick shots that can be launched further than their inherent range or curve off their natural four-directional path. However, because of the perspective, it can be hard to hit flying enemies, or large ones, due to shots passing behind their sprites when they appear to be on target.', 'One of the best things about The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is that every time I play, Isaac ends up looking and behaving radically differently  usually within a few moments of starting a run. He begins as a strangely adorable big-headed pink child with teary eyes that launch projectiles at enemies with typical twin-stick shooter controls, but picking up an item from behind a golden door can enhance his powers while disfiguring him in one of a hundred different horrible ways. One time you might pick up an item that turns him into a cyclops that fires huge mega-tears, and the next youll find a powerup thatll embed a meteorite in his head and cause his tears to orbit around him.', 'Even better, if you find one and then the other, Isaac will become a cyclops with a meteorite embedded in his head, with giant, powerful tears orbiting him and obliterating any flies or spiders or bloated corpse-babies nearby. Those continue to stack as you move from dungeon to dungeon, which sometimes allows you to become wildly overpowered - and yet still vulnerable to an unforeseen enemy type or stepping on spikes. You lose everything when you die, so the stakes rise with every promising new discovery. It keeps you guessing and adapting to new powers and challenges, all the while rewarding you with a huge variety of creepy-cute artwork.', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', 'Whats a bit annoying is how little information The Binding of Isaac gives you when you discover one of its hundreds of pickups. For example, when I pick up a piece of petrified poop, It feels lucky? flashes across the screen, but if I hadnt looked up what it does exactly on an external wiki, I might never have figured out its exact function. Im a big fan of the process of experimenting and discovering those abilities on my own, but some kind of built-in mechanism for remembering what they do wouldve been a big help, considering that in my hundreds of playthroughs there have been multiple items Ive still only seen once, and new ones are still being unlocked all the time.', 'Enemy variety is off the charts, too, with dozens of different attack patterns to learn and adapt to. The movement and attack patterns of several different types of spiders, hostile feces, ghosts, zombies, centipedes, blobs, floating heads, burrowing worms, shielded skull-inhabiting fleshy creatures, and way more are all different, and just when I think Ive got them figured out, they throw new combinations or variants at me and send me back to the beginning, where the whole cycle begins again - sometimes with an unlockable alternate character that changes up my starting stats.']",IGN

By exploring the world of the loot-driven shooter trilogy through the lens of a dialogue-heavy adventure game, Telltale has created a fantastic opening to a story rife with humor, interesting characters, powerful decisions, and effective mysteries. In the span of Episode 1: Zer0 Sums two and a half hours, Rhys and Fiona became some of the best lead characters Telltale has ever created, and Im entirely on board for their journey.', 'Traditional Borderlands games have you interacting with the world mostly through emptying the chambers of your various guns, but Telltale pretty much strips you of power save for you wit. Talking my way out of a deal gone bad, watching the face of my adversary to see whether or not they believe me, and choosing how far to take a lie was as tense as any shootout Ive ever experienced on Pandora. The entire thing is enhanced by a fantastic score that draws from classic westerns, Cowboy Bebop-esque jazz, and some great nods to various Borderlands themes.', '\n', 'The framing device in Zer0 Sum has Rhys and Fiona retelling the story of their initial meeting  a heist gone awry  and how the stakes quickly began to ratchet up to some pretty massive levels. Tales jumps back and forth between the pair, which results in some really great situations and moments to story reveals. Watching a deal go south from Rhys point of view and thinking you know the ins-and-outs of the scene, only to have everything turned on its head once you flesh in the details from Fionas perspective constantly gave the episode a great sense of pace and aggressive, effective storytelling.', '\n', 'While having prior Borderlands knowledge helps add a bit of context to the relationship between Hyperion and Pandora, why Zer0 is so rad, and just who the hell Handsome Jack is and why hes so notorious, newcomers will be just fine in Tales. This is mostly thanks to how strong of characters Rhys and Fiona are, and how great it is to be able to shade them in with your own unique decisions. Does your Rhys want people to view him as a fearsome murderer, or a genius with a silver tongue? If your Fiona has a clean shot at a target, does she take it, or would she rather get out of a situation with as a low a bodycount as possible? In the quick duration of Zer0 Sum, I fell in love with my versions of these two characters, and I cant wait to see where they go from here.', 'Tales from the Borderlands hits humorous notes through its dialogue, situations, and even elements of its menus. Characters are introduced with the series signature over-the-top title cards, and using Rhys ability to scan people and items in the environment leads to a ton of often-hilarious fun facts. Great writing and fantastic acting make each scene a joy to play through, and I found myself genuinely laughing out loud every few minutes of the first episode.', '\n', 'While the traditional Telltale mechanics of dialogue trees and tough decisions work as well as ever in Borderlands, the new currency system feels half-baked. Fiona is able to accumulate money through our various decisions and actions, like finding hidden chests or choosing whether or not to pillage some cash from a dying man. While I like this concept in theory, its execution is a bit clunky. The amount of money I was carrying dropped between two scenes for no apparent reason, and the actual things you can spend it on seems entirely superficial. Maybe there are big plans for buying your way into or out of trouble in future episodes, but for now money is the root of most of Tales from the Borderlands evils.', 'Like Walking Dead and Wolf Among Us, Tales is almost entirely devoid of puzzles, instead focusing on dialogue choices and character development. Im absolutely fine with this, but there are a few instances where I was forced to do a mundane action like push a cart across the screen and use it to climb up into a vent. Actions like this came across as tedious, and took me out of the story and the world for a brief moment.', 'Speaking of action, the chase scene near the end feels like a step back from the action scenes in The Wolf Among Us. Where Telltales take on Fables allows us to make some decisions in choreographing the flow of fight scenes, Borderlands relies heavily on pass/fail quick-ime events. For example, I scratched my nose during the action, and found myself dead and forced to restart the scene. You rarely even die that quickly in Borderlands 2.']",IGN

Heres what we said then:', 'Grand Theft Auto V is not only a preposterously enjoyable video game, but also an intelligent and sharp-tongued satire of contemporary America. It represents a refinement of everything that GTA IV brought to the table five years ago. Its technically more accomplished in every conceivable way, but its also tremendously ambitious in its own right. No other world in video games comes close to this in size or scope, and there is sharp intelligence behind its sense of humour and gift for mayhem. It tells a compelling, unpredictable, and provocative story without ever letting it get in the way of your own self-directed adventures through San Andreas.', 'It is one of the very best video games ever made.', '\n', 'Watch our full original video review.', 'Virtually everything in that review stands true of the 2014 version on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. This is the same 30-plus hours of action-heavy story missions with the same three satirical protagonists, and nearly limitless potential for driving, flying, boating, or biking around. Just a smattering of minor new side quests, different types of wildlife (from cats to dolphins), and collectibles top off its already enormous pile of content.', ""The key difference between GTA 5 on new-gen consoles and last year's version is that developer Rockstar has done an outstanding job of updating this still-amazing game so that it feels right at home on these platforms. Everything looks strikingly better running at full 1080p resolution, with dramatically enhanced textures, lighting effects, and detail in general. A greatly increased draw distance makes the vistas of the San Andreas region extremely impressive, and I dont know if Ive ever seen an in-game rainstorm as convincing as these. With this revamp, GTA 5 has reestablished itself as the high bar for what an open-world game can be in terms of scale, graphical quality, and density of things to do."", 'While the PlayStation 4 version has a slight graphical edge over the Xbox One, featuring noticeably more grass and plants in some areas, both generally do a good job of maintaining 30 frames per second, with only occasional minor slowdowns that mostly kick in when approaching busy intersections at high speed. Other than that, the only appreciable differences I spotted were that the Xbox Ones rumble triggers give driving a more tactile feel, and the DualShock 4 plays cell phone conversations and beeps through the controllers speakers, and the light on the controller flashes red and blue when the police are after you.', 'The big new feature for the new-generation consoles is the optional first-person mode. Its a whole new way of experiencing Grand Theft Auto like we never have before. Rockstar has gone out of its way to make sure everything looks great when viewing it through your characters eyes instead of over their shoulders, and the controls work pretty much the way you expect them to in a first-person shooter. An impressive amount of control configuration options let you tailor it to your liking, and you can even set it to automatically switch from first to third person when you enter cover or get into a car. The different perspective made things feel more like they were happening to me, rather than a character I was controlling, which makes GTA a surprisingly different experience. Driving or flying is, of course, a lot tougher with the more limited view, but still lots of fun, and the ability to switch at will makes it a luxury.', 'Its impressive how virtually no opportunity to throw in a subtle little touch was missed. There are now first-person-specific animations for all kinds of activities, including climbing ladders, getting yanked out of a car youve just stolen and thrown to the ground, and flipping the bird. Even in-mission events, like when Michaels son hands him a soda in the car, are animated  Michaels hand reaches out, takes the drink, and brings it up to the camera as he takes a sip.', 'GTA 5 for new-gen consoles also includes the still-problematic Grand Theft Auto Online multiplayer mode. Its absolutely great for small-scale multiplayer antics, where you and a few friends get together and do co-op jobs, races, death matches, vehicular combat battles, or just sew random chaos throughout the San Andreas region. However, in a week of trying, Ive never been able to get into a game with more than seven players  far short of the advertised increased limit of 30. Worse, the wait times to get in and out of matches has been extreme, to the point where my GTA Online experience has been roughly 60 percent playing and 40 percent waiting to play, with frequent disconnects and occasional crashes. Because of that, I cant strongly recommend getting GTA 5 based on the multiplayer experience alone.']",IGN

Except in This War of Mine, that quote really is a guiding principle. As you try to lead a group of survivors during an unnamed conflict, by scavenging for items, jury-rigging survival aids like heaters and vegetable gardens, and bartering with other survivors for goods, you might occasionally feel like you\'re getting the hang of wartime survival. But then This War of Mine reminds you, in shockingly effective and heartbreaking fashion, that war doesn\'t follow predictable rules. Sometimes everyone just dies, with no rhyme or reason.', ""One of my first games of This War of Mine turned out to be one my easiest, but I had no idea how well I was doing until later runs, when I struggled to regain the same ground. This time, my three survivors  Bruno, Pavle, and Marko  had almost everything they needed. I watched over them from the 2D, cutaway view of their shelter as fresh water came via a rain trap I'd built from assembled raw materials, and fresh meat came in from the homemade animal trap in the basement.

Marko seemed hardest hit, sliding into a ""depressed"" state while everyone else dipped to ""sad."" Nor did I realize that bad morale can cause a tailspin. Until this, Bruno\'s cigarette habit had been easy to ignore as I traded away our smokes for ""important"" stuff like raw materials and herbs. But now Bruno was sullen and frustrated, and complaining constantly about how he just wanted a smoke. Marko, meanwhile, shuffled through the day. Everything took longer as my survivors simply lost interest in working together. They fell to arguing.', 'Once characters ""break,"" they won\'t do anything at all. Talking people out of their depression takes the better part of a day, and may not even work. Getting drunk is a more promising route to restore equilibrium, but it also takes a lot of time and consumes liquor, which has huge potential as a bartering tool.', 'This is what makes this War of Mine so gripping, and so unforgettable. It remains as brutal and capricious a game as its subject matter. Your survival strategy is never much stronger than a house of cards, and small problems quickly snowball into big ones.', ""When they do, youll probably end up restarting  and This War of Mine is so difficult you'll end up restarting quite a bit  so its good that it rarely plays the same way twice. There's something like a dozen locations you'll see reused through different playthroughs, but what you find when you explore them will change each time. One time, your game may start in the dead of winter and will have to burn fuel for warmth, while another game sees temperatures fall only after a few weeks have passed.

Two squads of his boysour boyswere gunned down before I realized my mistake. And even though Johnny was only a static portrait on the campaign map, it really made me feel like a piece of garbage. Far from the teeth-gritting misanthropy of the original Soviet campaign in Company of Heroes 2, Ardennes Assaults real-time strategy retelling of the Battle of the Bulge made me regret every drop of American blood spilledemotionally and mechanically.', 'Taking a cue from some of Relics best single-player experiences in the Warhammer 40K: Dawn of War franchise, this stand-alone expansion features an open-ended campaign map on which I was charged with pushing the Third Reich out of the greater Belgium area. My left, right, and... other left hands in this endeavour are three persistent companies that can move, engage enemies, take casualties, and be upgraded independently. Each has its own interesting units and abilities, and a voiced commander with context-sensitive dialogue and a unique personality and backstory that helps make them feel like real people I didnt want to get killed.', 'Kurt Derby of the Support Company is a veteran of the first World War who continuously laments the plight of the kids under his command. Making smart use of assault engineers and fixed emplacements, Derbys boys were my go-to workhorses for any mission where I just needed to hold the damn line. Bill Edwards is a third-generation soldier with equal doses of optimism and idealism, leading the extremely mobile and aggressive Mechanized Infantry. They quickly became my favorite company, able to quickly deploy a lot of versatile firepower anywhere on the map, and capture multiple control points before the enemy could react.', 'And then theres Johnny Vastano. Thrust into command after the death of his superior, he isnt exactly what I would call management material. Leading the Airborne, notable for their ability to drop behind enemy lines and call in heavy air support, he has a very, War sucks, what am I doing here? outlook on our situation. While any of my commanders would wax melancholic about missions in which we took too many casualties, it was Vastanos almost unhinged, cuss-spattered rants that made me feel the worst. Well, that and the fact that every squad I lost brought me one step closer to outright losing the campaign.', 'Each company gains veterancy for completing missions, and upgrading its ability trees let me customize them in interesting ways. But each was also limited by a manpower pool, which became shallower with every casualty sustained in combat. When it gets low enough, the company is disbanded outright on the campaign map, and losing all three means restarting the campaign. That wasnt explained clearly up front, so it was a bit jarring when I found out the hard way. Combine that with the one available save file, which autosaves after each mission, and youve effectively got a mandatory iron man mode that cant be turned off. My first foray into Ardennes Assault ended with a frustrated whimper when I realized I was completely screwed, three missions from the final battle, because I wasnt careful enough with my manpower more than 10 hours ago. This isnt necessarily a bad thing. I can take some grief when the missions are as fun and varied as they are. But it was a shock to the system.', '', '', '', 'Aside from the brutal failure mechanic and inability to create multiple saves, the campaign is very well designed. Strategic decisions on the map I made between skirmishes were just as important as the tactical ones I made in the smoldering streets of Bastogne. I was constantly weighing the pros and cons of deploying behind enemy lines, at the cost of manpower, to cut off the Wehrmachts ability to fall back and regroup. Leaving a path of retreat could allow them to join up with their allies in a nearby province, increasing their strength. I found that reading objectives carefully and selecting a company based on each engagement was critical; the infantry-heavy Airborne was a poor choice for facing off against heavy Tiger tanks, and the Support crew didnt excel at any objective that called for lightning-fast aggression.', 'The missions themselves are an even mix of flavorful, handcrafted historical scenarios and standard, Company of Heroes staple capture the control points and deplete the enemy tickets skirmishes. This latter style is subject to random (sometimes frustrating) modifiers, such as only getting credit for kills made with vehicles, that change every time you run the campaign. All missions will also be modified by the relative enemy strength on the campaign map, which means that a straight push without cutting off retreat paths would leave all the remaining Germans bunched up in one corner of the map, where my work in dislodging them would be really cut out for me. When I did have to start again, I appreciated the variety this dynamic setup created.']",IGN
139,Super Smash Bros. for Wii U,19-Nov-14,Jose Otero,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/19/super-smash-bros-for-wii-u-review,"['I never thought Smash Bros. intense four-player multiplayer battles needed more fighters, but eight-player brawls have become one of my favorite modes in Super Smash Bros. for Wii U. Eight-player battles are local-only,  which is an unfortunate limitation, but if you get a group of friends together youll fill these big, vibrantly colorful arenas with sheer madness happening in every corner. Each character displays fantastic personality in combat, drawing on a rich history from dozens of different beloved games. As I strike, dodge, block, and weave through seven other fighters, a match builds up to a climax thats genuinely fun, each and every time. That represents Super Smash Bros. for Wii U as a whole: its bigger than ever, but remains laser-focused on the finely balanced action that makes this a legendary fighting game series.', 'Smash Bros. Wii U wraps more than 30 years of gaming history together into an approachable brawler. Every fighter in the 49-strong roster uses the same button-presses to execute attacks and special moves, but each has their own distinct style thats fun to learn. It makes them simple to pick up and play, but also challenging to master.', 'Bowser, for example, uses burly strikes and kicks to pummel foes into submission, while Smash Bros. newcomer Duck Hunt uses a tricky move set of clay-pigeon projectiles, explosive barrels, and attacks that make playful references to the 8-bit era. Add in iconic characters like Mega Man, Samus Aran, Captain Falcon, Fox McCloud, Animal Crossings Villager, Pac-Man, Wii Fit Trainer, Link, Mario himself, and dozens of others, and youve got something for pretty much anybody whos ever loved a video game.', 'The attention to detail in every part of Super Smash Bros. is fantastic, and all of it is delivered at a speedy and smooth 60 frames per second. Mega Man walks using his signature awkward sideways-shuffle, and the new Mario Kart Circuit arena captures the zero-gravity look and feel of a Mario Kart 8 track. Items like the deadly Bullet Bill or POW Block stir up old-school Super Mario Bros. memories while also sending a satisfying wallop to opponents. With so many tiny details and references to observe, itll take lots of hours to see everything Smash Wii U has to offer.', 'Excellent moment-to-moment combat is the real jewel of this game, and the many ways it can be played, from the Wii U GamePad to classic GameCube controllers with an adapter, make it a gift that keeps on giving. The action scales incredibly well: two-player duels are tense, while eight players all trying to Smash each other out of the ring is complete chaos. Turning items off removes the random element, turning it into more of a test of skill. But thats just the beginning.', 'The constant variety of the multiple modes keeps me playing. Event mode, for instance, makes learning new characters moves easy by putting them in playful solo or co-op adventures. One of these is Keep Em Off the Ship, in which you play as Falco and go up to smash a squad of parachuting Mr. Game & Watch enemies out of the ring, and it provided me some great training for how to use the speedy characters aerial attacks. The mission text makes some hilarious references to video game history, but the skills I picked up hold equal value, and the addition of two-player co-op makes it even more fun.', 'Modes like Classic, Special Orders, and All-Star take a similar approach, using diverse matches, fun scenarios, and specific rules to set up creative encounters, but each allows you to choose the level of risk and reward. Special Orders allow you to spend accumulated Smash coins on special event matches, where winning unlocks another trophy or a handy piece of custom equipment; the higher the difficulty, the better the prizes. However, losing comes at a hefty price torching most (or in some cases all) of the stakes, giving these matches special tension.', 'Nearly every mode of Super Smash Bros. offers a set of unlockable rewards, and the only parts about unlocking them that arent satisfying are the awkward menus and, more importantly, the stingy drop rates for custom special moves. Those swappable special moves alter the speed of Marios Fireball or the properties of other special attacks, so theyre pretty important and fun to mess with. The prospect of new custom equipment, special moves, beautifully rendered trophies, and more kept me playing for hours, even though Super Smash Bros. didnt really give me enough direction for how to actually unlock the prizes I wanted.', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'The only mode thats a snooze is Smash Tour, which is effectively a mediocre virtual board game with too many boring parts. Four players take turns gathering up stat buffs, items, and characters in a build up to a final battle, which is a cool concept, but Smash Tours approach distills the essence of this amazing brawler game into painfully short matches full of random elements that just dont have the same satisfying payoff or feeling of accomplishment.', 'Super Smash Wii Us online modes offer lots of match types to play with, from tense 1-on-1 showdowns without items, to 2v2 faceoffs in Team Smash, with up to two fighters playing from the same console. Just like in Mario Kart 8, getting friends together can be a little bit of a hassle involving text messages because Nintendos system doesnt allow for notifications. But once youre all set up, you can launch private matches with friends and unleash characters with customized movesets, or watch other players strategies through handy replay and spectator modes. Sadly, eight-player Smash doesnt make the cut online, but four players is more than enough for a good brawl.', 'This is also the first game to integrate with Nintendos new toys-to-life, called amiibo. There are no figures in the box, so this is an extra purchase, but if you do buy in theyll add another, much smaller avenue of variety to Super Smash Bros. for Wii U. Computer-controlled figure players will stand in as opponents, and each one learns to defend itself as it levels over time. The investment required to reach max level is small (maybe three hours) and having a brutally tuned A.I. to unleash on your friends is fun to watch  but of course, sometimes my amiibo made some questionable decisions. Ive seen my fully leveled Mario figure wreck opponents, but Ive also watched in horror as it totally gave away the match. Im proud of my amiibo, but sometimes its like dealing with a child that only listens half the time.\n\n \nMore Reviews On IGN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Magicka: Wizard Wars Review        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Shadowrun Chronicles: Boston Lockdown Review        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Story of Seasons Review        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Broken Age: Act 2 Review        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          State of Decay: Year One Survival Edition Review        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Halo: Spartan Strike Review        \n\n\n\n\n', '']",IGN
140,Sonic Boom: Shattered Crystal,13-Nov-14,Scott Thompson,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/13/sonic-boom-shattered-crystal-review,"['The latest in a growing list of attempts to reboot and revive Segas longtime mascot, Sonic Boom: Shattered Crystal places a heavy emphasis on exploration and puzzle solving. The levels are sprawling  certainly the largest Ive seen in a 2D Sonic game  and require the use of each characters abilities to uncover a variety of hidden items. As someone who took great pleasure in meticulously tracking down every Chaos Emerald way back in the original games, I went into Shattered Crystal hoping for an homage to that mechanic. Unfortunately, it is poorly implemented in a number of ways.', 'There are hamfistedly unsubtle stopping points where Sonic literally hits a wall, and you have to switch characters to make use of their unique abilities. You burrow under it with Knuckles, fly over it with Tails, or hit a faraway switch with newcomer Sticks boomerang; then keep running until the next wall. While playing as different members of Sonics confoundingly large cast isnt anything new for the series, and this is the first Sonic game where you can do so at will, this puzzle design is never put to any clever or interesting use; it just pointlessly slows things down.', 'On the topic of slowing down progress, Sonic Boom artificially extends its length by forcing you to play through the same levels several times. Completing a stage often wont unlock the next one; you need to collect all six crystals and five blueprints to earn enough special rings to move on. This means laboriously going through the same huge level over and over until you finally find all the hidden trinkets.', ""The task is worsened by a mostly ineffective map on the bottom screen that fails to illustrate where youve been and where you've yet to explore. Ironically, you can upgrade the map with the blueprints you find so that it reveals the locations of the crystals and blueprints when you are close to them, but that assumes youve got the patience to blindly wander around the first few levels on your own beforehand."", 'A few racing and boss stages help break up the monotonous exploration, thankfully. The boss battles, in particular, evoke the spirit of the old tubular bonus stages from Sonic 2, and are usually fun. Unfortunately, these levels only take a couple of minutes to complete, so the reprieve from trudging about in search of crystals and blueprints is short lived.', 'While the puzzles are simplistic and the exploration is forced down your throat, there are moments when that classic Sonic design shines through. Every now and then Sonic hits a speed boost, goes through a few loop-de-loops, and spins through enemies  that feels great. But all too quickly, youre punished by some chasm that requires slowly bouncing off enemies or utilizing a grappling hook to swing across, and its easy to miss the transition and plummet to your death. The gameplay often feels at odds with itself as you slam headfirst into a wall and then spend a few minutes trying to navigate Sticks boomerang through a tiny corridor to hit a switch. The moments of breakneck speed, as fun as they are, just dont connect with everything else Sonic is doing.', 'As if plodding through the same level a few times wasnt enough punishment, you also have the story cutscenes that precede and conclude every new level. It appears that the writing staff behind the concurrent Sonic Boom cartoon was not involved with the writing in Shattered Crystal, because the jokes  if you want to call them that  consistently fall flat as text boxes slowly fill during these unskippable scenes. The cast, from the now-brutish and braindead Knuckles to the infantile Sticks, spits out a bunch of painfully unfunny dialogue that induced audible groans throughout. For example:', 'Hello Shadow, I see youve come out of the shadows.', 'There are no shadows', 'Its a joke. Your name is Shadow. Hiding in the shadows. Get it? Its funny.', 'It really isnt, Sonic.']",IGN
141,Assassin's Creed Unity,11-Nov-14,Marty Sliva,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/11/assassins-creed-unity-review,"['Assassins Creed Unity is a game of impossible peaks and disappointing valleys. Its highs of movement, customization options, and just the city of Paris itself pierce the sky like the spire of Notre Dame. On a purely technical level, Unity is a marvel to walk through and admire. But at the same time, a lot of my journey through the French Revolution felt as cold and heartless as the darkest depths of the catacombs. I was never given a real reason to care about new Assassin Arno, or the events that transpired. Instead, I had to find my own fun throughout my 30 hours in Unity, which was generally easy to do in its large sandbox assassination scenarios. However, its a bit disappointing to see how few of the long-standing problems with the series have been solved by the upgrade to the new generation of gaming hardware.', 'The new consoles graphical power is put to good use in Ubisofts recreation of 18th-century Paris, which is absolutely stunning. As weve come to expect from an Assassins Creed game, its sprawling, gorgeous, and absolutely packed with sights to see and things to do. Climbing to the top of Notre Dame, synchronizing with one of the series iconic viewpoints, and watching the camera pull back and show you the breadth of your universe is staggering.', '\n', ""Each of the various districts unfolds with its own sense of character and environmental storytelling, from the ornate palaces of the privileged, to back-alleys running with the blood of the revolutionaries. But what makes it really unique and distinct from past games is its citizens, who form some of the largest, most impressive crowds I've ever encountered. In particular, a late-game mission involving Louis XVI was populated with several thousand characters, and wading through the crowd was one of the most memorable moments of the campaign."", 'Despite being technologically impressive and adding a lot to the atmosphere of Paris as a living and thriving city, I found myself oftentimes swearing at the digital hoards that populated the streets when I simply wanted to make my way from one place to another. As the story progressed, I found that the masses of Parisians mostly got in the way, and spotting repeating character models was a crude reminder I was playing a video game.', 'The disgruntled masses make it even more of a necessity to scurry along rooftops instead of the streets, and thankfully, this mode of transportation does not disappoint. Most of the time, traversal in Unity feels better than ever thanks to fantastic animations, buildings with plenty of climbable paths, and a new downward parkour system that adds certain finesse to the act of shimming down a wall, resolving one of my big gripes with previous AC games. (Unless there was a haystack handy, I usually just lept off and hoped that I had enough health to survive.)', '\n', 'When it all worked perfectly, guiding my Arno up, down, and across the Parisian skyline brought me a great sense of satisfaction. The key phrase there was when it all worked, because the series-long frustration of your assassin not doing quite what you want him to do is still present here. I found myself quickly losing momentum and clumsily hopping about whenever I tried to enter a window and explore any of Unitys huge array of interior spaces. It was also particularly frustrating in stealth sections, which Unity emphasizes heavily. Navigating between pieces of cover is finicky, and it was never clear whether or not I was even hidden.', 'Getting back on the story track, I found that Unitys main Assassins-versus-Templars plot is relatively forgettable, and has none of the fun and levity of last years Assassins Creed IV: Black Flag. Arno is a one-dimensional character whose motivation is little more than the standard revenge tale. I never really found a reason to care about his Forrest Gump-style quest through the French Revolution, and an unfulfilling ending definitely left a sour taste in my mouth. (Whats more, the fact that everyone in Unity - including Napoleon Bonaparte himself - speaks with an English accent is completely inexplicable and immersion-breaking.)', '\n', 'It didnt help that Arno doesnt bring any distinctive new Assassin abilities to the table, making combat the same parry-heavy scenarios as in previous games. Enemies are definitely more aggressive this time around, but I found that cheesing the smoke bomb ability led to cheap victories in even the toughest battles. Theres also a sharp, jarring difficulty spike in the final Sequence, which led to a whole mess of annoying failures until I finally found a crude, unfulfilling way to just get past the mission and put it all behind me.', 'Thankfully, aside from that final Sequence, the missions themselves are generally pretty great. First off, there are almost no annoying tailing missions, which have always been a bane of the series. Instead, Unity is filled with a wide range of interesting activities. Side-quests filled with Parisian myths, legends, and tall-tales pepper the city. Gathering severed heads for Madame Tussaud, uncovering the mysteries of a catacombs-dwelling cult, and befriending the captivatingly weird Marquis de Sade all proved to be great little micro-stories.', '\n', 'Interestingly, Unity has the least amount of outside-the-Animus meta-story of any Assassins Creed game  which Im actually thankful for. The few moments where you do leave 18th-century Paris unfold as surprising set-pieces that I wouldnt want to spoil for you, but were each extremely entertaining. These sections definitely rely heavily on scripted events, but each one proved to be an exciting break from the main story.', 'The best missions in Unity, though, are the sandbox assassinations that usually conclude each Sequence, and which consistently left me thrilled. Each one is a puzzle with a ton of different solutions. For instance, your target is inside a heavily fortified cathedral. Do you want to steal a key and creep in through a side door, climb up to the top of the church and shimmy in through an open window, slink through the catacombs and come up from underneath, or simply throw caution into the wind and go in swords-a-blazing?', '\n', 'All of these are possible, and experimentation is encouraged thanks to Creed Points (their term, not mine) that reward interesting decisions with currency that can be spent to upgrade your weapons and armor. This new depth of character customization is one of Unitys best contributions to the series. Money and Creed Points are relatively scarce, and I always found myself agonizing over which weapon to purchase, which pieces of armor to upgrade, and which skills to unlock. The decision between lock picking or poison bombs, or between armor that improves combat or stealth, would change the way I approached encounters throughout the campaign in meaningful ways.', 'While Arnos 15-hour story arc is one that can only be experienced alone, there are a ton of side missions in Unity that encourage, require, and reward drop-in cooperative gameplay. Two-player Heists demand constant communication, with a single misstep usually resulting in a chaotic mess of steel, bullets, and failure. Playing with a buddy was always entertaining, despite the fact that most missions boiled down to us trying to be stealthy, getting spotted, and then proceeding to just murder every living thing within the city limits. Practice might eventually make perfect.', '\n', 'Once four players team up for a mission, a terrific blend of competitive cooperation forms. If one person dies, the entire team loses, so its in your best interest to keep your friends alive. At the same time, your rewards at the end of the mission are dependent on how well you played individually, creating situations where you arent sure whether you should hop in and help a buddy in need, or remain hidden and grow your own potential reward.', 'I really appreciate that single-player and multiplayer all feeds into the same central economy. No matter what I was doing in Unity, I was always progressing my character a bit forward down the path of becoming a master assassin.', '', '', 'PlayStation 4 Version', 'Out of the box, the PS4 version of Unity has some significant framerate issues, but after the 900MB day-one patch and the PS4 2.02 firmware, it ran pretty much on par with its Xbox One counterpart. Apart from some minor hiccups in large crowds and certain Synchronization points, there werent any annoying performance issues. Load times and multiplayer matchmaking also ran the same across both platforms.', ""[Update: While Marty didn't encounter significant frame rate problems playing yesterday, last night other IGN staff saw troublesome slowdowns on the PS4 version of Assassin's Creed Unity. Others report similar issues with the Xbox One version. The experience shown in the video below isn't happening to everybody, but it's concerning.]"", '\n', '', '\n', 'PC Version', 'As weve previously reported, the PC version of Unity requires a pretty hefty rig to run, and an even heftier one is recommended. That said, those of you who have access to this will find that Unity on PC looks even better than its console brethren thanks to being able to run at resolutions above 900p, enhanced textures, and (hardware permitting) a much higher frame rate than the locked 30fps of the Xbox One and PS4.', '\n', 'I put time into Unity on an IGN PC with a Core i7-4670 CPU, a GeForce GTX 780, and 8GB RAM. With all of the graphical settings maxed at Ultra presets and 1920x1080 resolution, it ran at about 30fps, sometimes dipping into the 20s in the midst of major crowds. With a few minor tweaks, such as reducing shadow quality and bloom lighting, we got it running in the ballpark of 40 to 50, save for in-engine cutscenes which tended to dip back down into the 30s.']",IGN
142,World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor,13-Nov-14,Leif Johnson,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/13/world-of-warcraft-warlords-of-draenor-review,"[""The 2014 World of Warcraft expansion reminds me of that brief, happy period when I'd managed to get myself into impressive shape and then hid all the photos of my former bloated self from anyone I dated until we got to know each other a little better. Warlords of Draenor takes that same approach. Blizzard's resilient MMORPG may be 10 years old this year, but it keeps you anchored to the latest content like no other expansion before it. Blizzard wants you to keep your attention on Draenor, and it's easy to see why. While elements of the expansion overemphasize single-player play a tad, the core experience of playing the reigning MMO king has never been so enjoyable."", 'With this expansion, WoW places virtually all services in the new faction hubs of Stormshield and Warspear, circumventing the need to cavort about decade-old assets to toss an item on the auction house. It allows you to engage in expansion-specific profession tasks regardless of your skill level. It even allows a free boost to level 90 for anyone who buys the expansion. Thanks to new character models and other updates, WoW hardly looks its age until you move beyond the borders of the old world and into the new content.', 'Orcs & Humans', ""It's also Warcraft at its purest. Warlords of Draenor may come packaged in a silly time-travel story focusing on Garrosh Hellscream's attempt to hook up with dear ol' dad for Azerothian invasion fun, but at heart it's a story about the necessity of killing a bunch of orcs. And they're cool orcs, too. Blizzard killed off most of its good villains long ago, but this time-hopping tale to the orcish homeworld of Draenor before the events of Warcraft: Orcs & Humans started allows us to face them all again."", ""For 20-year veterans of Warcraft like me, it's brimming with nostalgia. There's Ner'zhul, the orc who merged with Arthas to become the Lich King! There's Grom Hellscream, still as much of a punk as ever! Blizzard introduces these guys and a bunch of other, well, warlords of Draenor so quickly in an hour-long instanced segment that it's surely hard to keep track of them all if you're new, but it rarely matters. They look cool, the cutscenes establish their personalities within seconds, and they're fun to fight. If the simplistic story stumbles, it's only in that Blizzard seems to take too many cues from Game of Thrones by killing so many key characters off along the leveling trail just as we've come to love them all over again."", ""But the surrounding world of Draenor itself is just as compelling a character. It's beautiful, for one, and as with the rest of the WoW, it's populated with snazzy new character models for almost every race. The world itself is technically the same one we already saw in 2007's The Burning Crusade expansion, but setting Warlords before its destruction allows it to assume a different look entirely. The old fan-favorite zone of Nagrand largely remains intact, but here we find grassy, moonlit meadows in place of the barren wastes of 2007's Shadowmoon Valley, and the formerly ruined dome of Auchindoun is restored to splendor. Warlords of Draenor sees Blizzard return to the aesthetic heights it reached in Mists of Pandaria, but here the focus on orcish encampments and savage surroundings appeals to the most primal elements of the Warcraft experience."", ""It's an environment you'll almost always experience on foot or hoof. Blizzard took the big step of removing flying mounts entirely for Warlords of Draenor, and while the inability to cross a mountain range just by flying over it sometimes stings, the journey is better for it. The shift restores the focus on exploration thats been lost since the original game, when it was necessary to look around for new pathways to ascend lonely peaks and find seemingly inaccessible treasures. It adds a welcome touch of adventure to the act of hunting down quest enemies, as you need to navigate through dozens of his or her buddies instead of just swooping down a bashing them in the head. At eye level, Draenor feels more like a world we're living in, rather than a topographic map."", 'But as lovely as the world may be, it\'s the revised questing structure that gives it strength. You\'ll still find the basic quests that require you to kill 10 of this or pick up five of that, but they\'re woven deftly into a world that\'s brimming with ""rare"" enemies dropping superior loot and bonus objectives outside the main story that drop bucketloads of XP. Well-integrated actiony cutscenes push the pace along as well as any single-player RPG, and a new chance of winning loot upgrades with every quest turn-in adds a dose of excitement to this most basic of MMO tasks. Little treasures now dot the countryside, allowing humorous insights into Warcraft\'s lore or the chance of godly loot well below the level cap. Most notably of all, Warlords lets you choose one of two outposts that grant bonuses for each zone, thereby customizing your experience and imbuing the landscape with choice and an additional layer of individuality. In Nagrand, for instance, you might engage in neverending mounted combat astride a fleet-footed talbuk, or you could choose to steamroll through the enemies in your very own tank.', 'Mr. Garrison', 'All of the associated quests emphasize that the story here is all about you. You\'re not just some adventurer; you\'re the ""commander""  the slayer of the Lich King and the bane of the dragon Deathwing  and NPCs salute you and murmur admiringly about your exploits as you strut past. This philosophy comes to a head in the Warlords of Draenor\'s new Garrisons, where you can build and expand your own little city in the corners of each faction\'s Draenor starting zone. As with the outposts, the main garrison is all about letting you customize your playstyle as you wish, and it affects almost all levels of gameplay. Want new mounts and immunity to being dazed while mounted? Build and upgrade your stables. Want your own access to a both personal and guild banks and an auction house? Build and upgrade your trading post. And my personal favorite: Want more chances to get upgrades from quest loot? Toss up a Dwarven bunker.', '\n', ""Across three tiers, garrisons evolve in much the same way that bases did in the old Warcraft strategy games, morphing from ramshackle fortifications to full-on castles with stone walls and spires. But there's more than a little touch of Facebook social games here: you log in every day, harvesting the convenient herbing and mining nodes (regardless of whether you're an herbalist or a miner), and you send off various followers you've recruited through your questing to bring back resources and gold. Games like Star Wars: The Old Republic and Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood already pioneered similar concepts, but in true Blizzard fashion, Warlords of Draenor takes the idea and makes it more fun by including brief little animations showing the outcome of their off-screen ventures and by letting them hang around your garrison to chew the fat. It's addicting fun in the same way that social games can be fun if they get their hooks in you. (And like social games, garrisons can be disastrously expensive if you're not prepared. I've already pumped around 17,000 gold into my own, and I'm nowhere near finished.)"", ""I worry, though, that garrisons focus too heavily on the single-player aspect, to the detriment of World of Warcraft's community. Garrisons pull key services such as banks, herbs, mining nodes, stables, vendors, and even auction houses into a single-player instance, thereby minimizing the need to even go out into the world and interact with other people. And the strengths of those interactions (barring the omnipresent racist and spiteful spew in general chat) has always been one of the factors in keeping WoW above its ambitious competitors. Many of us come back to WoW at least partly because that's where our friends are, and garrisons potentially reduce the chances to make more friends."", 'Reach Out and Touch Someone', ""That said, the traditional avenues for hobnobbing with other players remain, whether it's in the dungeons, raiding guilds, or on the new 100-on-100 player-versus-player battlespace of Ashran. Blizzard's removal of flying for Draenor has also had the happy effect of making random conversations with nearby players more common than they were in the time of Cataclysm of Pandaria, as we now have to work together to find paths to objectives or take down tough rare enemies in Nagrand for reputation items."", '\n', ""So far, it's good enough to keep me logging in every day to build up my garrison and complete the steps to earn the legendary ring all players have access to, much as with the legendary cloaks from Mists of Pandaria. The excitement of the leveling experience dwindles a tad at the level cap, although this should be temporary. The first raid for Warlords of Draenor (due December 2) hasn't been released yet, and thus much of the currently PvE endgame centers on obnoxiously grindy daily quests for the apexis crystals that'll be used as currency for better loot. On the bright side, players are figuring out that they can get Apexis quests done faster if they work in a group, thus providing a welcome counterpoint to the dicey though enjoyable single-player focus of the garrisons."", ""Elsewhere, the new PvP zone of Ashran strikes me as little more than a melee-hostile, zergy tug-of-war arena between Horde and Alliance (and thus establishes itself as one of Warlords' few weak points), but it provides some fun partly though the ability to summon big bosses in the style of the old days of Alterac Valley. I've always been a lover of World of Warcraft's dungeons, and I'm pleased to report that they remain in top form here despite a poor introduction from the yawn-inducing Bloodmaul Slag Mines at level 90 or so. They're not terribly hard even on their heroic modes (and even that challenge will likely dissipate once more players get geared), but they're fun, as exemplified by the banter of the foremen in the Iron Docks or the entirety of Grimrail Depot, which follows your adventures as you hijack a moving train. If the raids prove as entertaining, Warlords of Draenor could easily end up going down in history as World of Warcraft's best overall expansion, and there's no better way to celebrate its 10-year anniversary."", ""Of course, Warlords of Draenor hasn't exactly been the smoothest of World of Warcraft's launches, and I once spent over eight hours in a queue before getting in. Thankfully, after several emergency maintenance periods and server restarts, the trouble on that front appears to be over  and Blizzard has compensated everyone with five days of free subscription time.""]",IGN

Its a smart, human premise that justifies Ajays rampant warpath throughout Kyrat, but Ajay isnt remotely as interesting as the things he does.', 'Versatility is the greatest strength in Far Cry 4s first-person exploration and combat. I scaled cliffs with climbing gear in search of treasure, religious monuments, and hostages in need of rescue. In venturing into the Himalayan mountains, I stole oxygen masks and snowmobiles to survive, and used the unstable environment to crush enemies with snow.

This is sometimes compromised by lower-resolution textures and an inferior draw distance on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, but Far Cry 4 is comparable to Far Cry 3 in terms of visual fidelity, and up to expectations for old-generation hardware.', 'I loved discovering every inch of Kyrat because it always presented compelling opportunities. Liberating it from the oppressive government was always front and center; as in Far Cry 3, enemy-occupied towers serve as platforming puzzles with a fulfilling sense of personal progression. Climbing to the top gives you a broader perspective of the world, highlighting notable places and unlocking new objectives.', ""Liberating outposts is more challenging in Far Cry 4 than in its predecessor, and more satisfying as a result. Take the stealthy approach and you can disable alarms individually to prevent enemy reinforcements, and use bait to attract tigers, bears, and other animals to occupy the enemys attention. The hard counter to this is the Hunter, a new, silent enemy wielding a bow and capable of charming animals into fighting for him. He creates another unexpected variable that made me think even harder about how these excellent combat systems worked together. Plus, enemy forces sometimes attempt to reclaim their territory, challenging you to drop what you're doing and fend off waves of ruthless soldiers. This also  encourages you to take down specific strongholds that, when vanquished, cease the takeovers. Wrestling with the Royal Army like this puts an even stronger emphasis on outposts, one of the franchise's most alluring attractions."", ""These encounters emphasize the importance of improvisation in Far Cry 4. The unpredictability of a situation getting out of hand often leads to catastrophic, unforgettable moments  like the time I blew up a bear with C4 to protect the hired guns I'd called in to help take an outpost. Once, I shot grenades from my personal helicopter and watched the fire trap the enemies below. Another time, I mounted an elephant, smashed through a gate, and flipped a pickup truck into a man. Tossing enemies with my elephants one-hit-kill trunk is basically everything I dreamed it would be."", ""Outpost battles  particularly the four larger fortresses owned by government officers  are at their best when a friend drops in for some two-player co-op. Adding another player to the volatility of Far Cry combat leads to new kinds of hectic, hilarious moments. Cooperative multiplayer also introduces new tactical opportunities, like having one player blow through the front door while another sneaks in through the back to stab distracted guards. You can, if you're patient and skilled, use Far Cry 4's Map Editor to create your own single-player outpost missions. At launch, most of the best missions are familiar takeover objectives, with a nice variety of snowy settings, evening assaults, and intricate, larger level designs. I don't see myself making much, but I'll absolutely jump into a community map between co-op outpost runs."", 'Far Cry 4s competitive multiplayer does a marvelous job of capturing the freedom, scale, and surprises of its co-op and campaign. The 5v5 competitive multiplayer, called Far Cry Chronicles, sees two asymmetrical factions fighting in different ways, using the wide-open environments to their particular advantages. The Golden Path plays more like an aggressive Far Cry player tends to -- guns, explosives, vehicles, and traps. The Rakshasa, who borrow supernatural powers seen in Shangri-La, relying on invisibility, and different types of arrows for their bow.', ""I adore the Rakshasa style -- teleporting with the Blink Arrow, whether for navigation, escape, or an instant kill, is a great tool. Summoning a tiger or bear to guard an area works beautifully. Chronicles also has a strong economy, with in-game successes earning coins to spend on new weapons, attachments, or skills, such as stronger stealth, faster movement, or a closer connection to wildlife summons. The maps arent terribly notable in Chronicles, and the modes are simple, unremarkable, but functional, but borders on miraculous that the heart and soul of Far Cry 4 found its way into a competitive mode at all. Its a bummer that matches start whether or not teams are even, and that not a lot of people are actually playing it, because this is actually great. Don't skip multiplayer because it isn't why you play a Far Cry game."", 'The supernatural side-story set in Shangri-La stands out above nearly every other objective, online feature, and other Far Cry 4 success, though. Like a miniature Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon doled out in chunks throughout Far Cry 4, the psychedelic, stunning aesthetic of its crimson foliage and golden skies is completely unlike Kyrat, as is the foundation of its combat. Its linear, by design, but introduces enough new and interesting ideas to have an identity of its own. Teaming up with a fierce tiger, slowing time, and firing five arrows at a time to take down fearsome demons is a huge change of pace. The myth is explained episodically, and while I didnt fully understand the legend, I couldnt seek out the next piece of Shangri-Las weird, wonderful world fast enough.', 'All of these missions feed into Far Cry 4s brilliant economy, where everything in Kyrat has a cause and effect. Hunting and skinning animals lets you craft holsters to hold more weapons, or wallets to carry more money. Reclaiming enemy territory creates fast-travel points and opens side-quests promising huge cash payouts. Destroying propaganda posters unlocks new missions as well as earns experience points. XP unlocks new skills, like aerial takedowns, damage resistance, and riding elephants, which is both hysterical and actually useful. It also presents opportunities to become a better hunter  unlockable injections show off animal and enemy locations, or double the damage you deal and take.', 'Far Cry 4 borrows heavily from Far Cry 3s superb player progression (many of the skills are direct carryovers), and then layers new rewards on top of it. New Karma Events unlock gear, discounts, and XP for spinning spiritual prayer wheels, or killing specific enemies in randomly occurring objectives.', 'Half the campaigns main missions are strong, memorable, and take advantage of Far Cry 4s flexible combat. These quests typically explore Ajay Ghales fascinating family history, or the ethically gray future of the Ghales faction, The Golden Path, and the dark places your choices can take it.', 'The Golden Paths bickering leaders, Amita and Sabal, are the emotional anchor for this part of the story. Theyre unified in their goal to dethrone the despicable king of Kyrat, Pagan Min, but their conflicting personal philosophies cause volatile problems for the country. I was often conflicted about who to side with during single-player missions  both make strong ethical arguments for why you should, say, claim an enemy opium farm to fund your revolution, or destroy it to free Kyrat from narcotics. Where the Golden Path goes, and which missions become available, differ depending on who you choose to lead the revolution. When Amita and Sabal arent involved, Far Cry 4s cast of mostly poor characters compromises its campaign.', 'The weaker half of the story relates to Pagan Min and his lieutenants. I barely remember what the missions were, or what completing them accomplished. Pagan Min is a great character, thanks to an excellent, gleefully sadistic and twisted performance from actor Troy Baker. But Min is completely misused. He has a thunderous introduction, followed by a disappointing, minimal presence throughout Far Cry 4s 15-hour campaign. Worse, his poorly explained henchmen dont have time to become interesting before vanishing from the story in sudden and confusing ways.', 'When Id finished with a story I simultaneously loved and loathed, I keep returning to my meandering around Kyrat. I uncovered new temples. I found more of Ajays fathers journals, chronicling the struggles of The Golden Paths rise. I wondered whether Id made the right choices for Kyrat -- a country I didnt want to leave, and a place Ill continue fighting for as long as it keeps giving me reasons to.']",IGN

After playing the slowly paced Book One, which includes the first two chapters of the story and a short interlude, I wish Dreamfall Chapters was released all at once, too. It feels slow to start and heavy on exposition, yet somehow poor at giving newcomers enough background material to care about the characters or even fully understand what the heck is going on.', 'Dont get me wrong: once all five books are released, Dreamfall Chapters *could* be phenomenal. Judged as a stand-alone entry, though, Book One: Reborn can be confusing, introducing you to three different playable characters and four different settings in its relatively brief three to five hours.', 'With just a few cryptic lines about how she ended up here, were reintroduced to main character Zoe Castillo, still trapped in a coma following the events of Dreamfall, and the concept of Storytime - an ethereal netherworld where we go when we dream. Theres no recap of Dreamfalls deep, intricate storyline, and the lack of backstory gets even more confusing in Chapter 2 when the action suddenly drops you into the subplot of Kian Alvane. Hes another returning character from Dreamfall, whos been imprisoned in the magical world of Arcadia for treason. In short, you should probably go back and play The Longest Journey if you want to know why you should care about these people.', 'Even within the scope of Dreamfall Chapters itself, the lack of context can be frustrating. When we return to Zoe six months later in yet another setting - the dystopian futuristic city of Europolis where youll spend most of Book One - she starts by unloading a big information dump of exposition to her therapist that turns out to be more dull than informative. Its a lazy storytelling device that slows down the already leisurely pace of this first episode. Meanwhile, the amateurish voice acting of the therapist character is in stark contrast to the strong performances of Zoe and a few other characters. Acting quality is all over the place.', 'Dreamfall Chapters gameplay is very similar to its predecessor, letting you easily control a free-roaming character in third-person and seamlessly interact with noteworthy objects via pop-up icons. Thankfully, the combat and stealth systems that mucked up Dreamfall: The Longest Journey have been dropped in lieu of straightforward adventuring and puzzle-solving, such as creating a makeshift torch by combining an oily rag with an arrow. Most of the puzzles are too easy for my tastes, though Ill admit to lucking into the answer of one or two of them. So few items exist for you to pick up that combining the two you have, no matter how dubious it may seem, is probably the right solution.', 'One standout puzzle sees Zoe tasked with evaluating a banged-up bot for duty. The robots comedic antics and voice are reminiscent of Borderlands Claptrap, while its crass name (shh...it rhymes with Itbot) makes you remember that this is an adventure with mature themes and writing, even when it veers into potty humor. Figuring out how to direct this inept hunk of hovering junk, such as fixing other broken bots, is made more entertaining due to its excitable personality.', 'Much like The Walking Dead episodes, choices that you make - such as interrupting a conversation or merely eavesdropping - will be remembered by other characters, and will supposedly influence gameplay. I say supposedly because I saw little such influence in Book One; presumably most of the ramifications of your choices wont be felt until more Books are released. Its one of those features that has awesome potential, but its too soon to say whether itll ever be fulfilled.', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', 'Advertisement', 'Book One does save the best for last, leaving a good impression.

145,Freedom Wars,5-Nov-14,Colin Moriarty,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/05/freedom-wars-review,"[""Freedom Wars certainly isn't the only Monster Hunter clone available on Vita, but its perhaps its most successful one. The staying power of its addictive fight-loot-upgrade cycle is enhanced by deep gameplay and customization options, though those occasionally do get lost behind a couple of unfortunate design choices."", ""Like Soul Sacrifice, Vita's first Monster Hunter clone of any consequence, Freedom Wars is drowning in story and lore, though unlike Soul Sacrifice, skipping over or ignoring the plot isn't all that easy. There are a bunch of characters to meet and a ton of text to read through, but mere hours into the adventure, I didn't find myself caring a great deal about anything that was going on. Purists will likely appreciate the fact that the original Japanese voice acting is intact, but Freedom Wars' story tends to get in the way of what really matters: gameplay. This is doubly annoying, considering the amount of backtracking and fast-traveling you'll have to do simply to advance the story to points where you can fight Freedom Wars' gigantic, hulking enemies called Abductors (but more on that later)."", 'Ironically, the setting -- and its single-minded dedication to its overarching themes -- is much better, and wonderfully complements its feeling of immersion. Freedom Wars takes place in a far-flung future where massive cities known as Panopticons endlessly compete with one another for resources. Anyone who presents even a mild strain on this already-overtaxed system -- like us -- are deemed Sinners, and in turn are given exorbitant million-year prison sentences that can only be reduced by working for the state, towards what the government deems The Greater Good. It made me wish the campaign focused less on endless chatter and exposition and more on playing up the oddity and unsettling nature of everything around you, especially since much of what you do revolves around whittling down your sentence.', ""Orwellian language is used everywhere, and evidence of a totalitarian system run amok can be glimpsed in all corners, further adding to a thick layer of intrigue. Do you want to remodel your character or change his or her clothing? That's called Requesting an Image Overhaul and Physical Remodeling. Want a new name? That's referred to as Nominative Reassignment. Care to browse some in-game tutorials? You'll need to go to View Reeducation Materials. Want to leave your jail cell? Then you'll need to Request Exit Permit."", ""Your Panopticon's true prison-state status comes to the fore when you start talking about so-called Entitlements, however, or the right to do just about anything, both inside and outside of battle. Using points earned by Donating to the Greater Good, you have to buy the right to sit down, to run, to talk to people of the opposite sex. Freedom Wars' insistence on making you feel like an isolated, dangerous, and mistreated prisoner truly goes above and beyond, and is perhaps its greatest calling card. Better yet, it ups the ante by punishing you for doing things you don't have an Entitlement for. Laying down on your cot in your cell? Better not do that, or you can expect to get 20 years added to your already-exorbitant million-year sentence. You can imagine how serious the penalties for real infractions can be."", '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'Once on the field of battle -- a handful of maps running the gamut from gigantic to tiny, from nature-based to industrial -- the fun of Freedom Wars truly begins. The aforementioned Abductors, gigantic cybernetic beasts that tend to capture and hold captive productive Panopticon citizens, will challenge you and your team, (which can be made up of AI characters or real people). The idea in these battles isnt gunning and bashing with reckless abandon, but rather collaboration, using the weapons at your disposal -- swords, spears, assault rifles, chain guns, and more -- to bring these creatures down in unison.', ""With bullets whizzing by, swords colliding with metal, and danger all around, Freedom Wars third-person hack-and-slash (and shoot) battles are frenetic and satisfying, but they also typically take quite a bit of time to get through. Abductors are very, very strong, and they can withstand incredible amounts of damage. When you're fighting two, or even three at a time, it'll take real effort and coordination to obliterate them all. For example, some of my battles went like this: one team member focused on using her Thorn -- effectively a hookshot -- to climb onto an Abductor, working to saw off one of its guns or limbs. Meanwhile, another two team members stayed far away, taking potshots with firearms, while a brave fourth member gets up close, using his thorn to temporarily bring the Abductor to the ground, where its susceptible to getting beat up."", ""Equally satisfying is watching pieces and parts of the Abductors fly off as you whittle them down to scrap metal. When you eliminate a gun, armor plate, or other section of an Abductor, it becomes a collectible that you can use to upgrade your own weapons, augmentations, and more. The interplay between what you find in battle, strewn around maps, garnered from fallen Abductors, and purchased in stores is awesome, because you'll slowly build a mountain of random items that, when utilized in conjunction with the crafting system, lets you fully control the nature of your arsenal and loadout on the fly."", ""Unfortunately, not every fight involves an Abductor. For some reason, Freedom Wars' designers occasionally throw in a bunch of fodder for you to fight, whether accompanying Abductors or, worse yet, on their own. Because of the loose nature of the aiming system and controls that don't translate to Sinner-on-Sinner battle, fighting fellow humans and smaller robots is a constant exercise in frustration. The late-game Code 7 Test mission in particular is an excellent example of why, if Freedom Wars gets a sequel, there should be no fighting of smaller enemies of any kind. It just doesn't work right."", ""But there's so much that does work right in Freedom Wars, and it's a game that kept me plenty busy. It'll take at least 20 hours -- if not more -- to get through the campaign, and you could conceivably spend scores of hours after that doing all of the optional quests, upgrading your character, finding new gear and goods, and collecting the full array of Trophies. It can be played in short bursts or for hours at a time, and better yet, it never forces you to play alone or online. You can do both, or one or the other, and the experience never suffers.""]",IGN
146,Halo: The Master Chief Collection,6-Nov-14,Ryan McCaffrey,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/06/halo-the-master-chief-collection-review,"['The Halo series has the historic distinction of inspiring millions of gamers to spend hundreds of dollars on new consoles just to play it. The Master Chief Collection  which includes all four numbered entries in the series  is a great reminder that Halo succeeded not because of hype or flavor-of-the-month popularity, but because of timeless first-person shooter design. With excellent stories, sandbox battlefields, and great AI, everything holds up against modern shooters, many of which owe a huge debt to Halos inspiration. Its all presented beautifully, with remade graphics and sound that allow old hands like me to relive the glory days through rose-tinted glasses, and new fans to appreciate the classics without having to look past decade-plus-old graphics. However, Halos memorable multiplayer modes are undermined by unacceptably unreliable and bug-ridden performance in the days after launch, to the point where I cant recommend that you buy Master Chief Collection right now for that functionality. Thats heartbreaking, but on the bright side theres still more than enough single-player and co-op content here to strongly recommend it for those alone.', 'The fan service begins right at the main menu: a flick of the thumbstick starts playing the soundtrack of the selected game. Its a laudable touch, considering how big a part Halos musical scores have played in establishing the series memorable atmosphere.', 'I jumped straight to the star of the Master Chief Collection: Halo 2 Anniversary. Like 2011s Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary, Halo 2 Anniversary is actually running two graphics engines at the same time, allowing you to instantly switch from 2004 graphics to 2014s Xbox One coat of paint and back again at the touch of a button. Admittedly, the new facade is a bit rough around the edges  I saw occasional frozen enemies, some framerate dips, and a few long loading screens that jarringly interrupt the pace as the impressive new cutscenes cue up. And while the graphics are up to modern standards in many ways, theyre hardly jaw-dropping. Some parts of the campaign seem unnecessarily dark, for instance, and I dont agree with all of the choices made on the new art. But the sum of Halo 2 Anniversarys parts  most notably a classic campaign that now runs at 60 frames per second  trumps its minor annoyances.', 'Im giving the audio a standing ovation. Halo 2s already-great soundtrack has been remastered, and sounds bigger and fuller while remaining reverential and respectful to the original. Its so good Id listen to it in my car. Meanwhile, Chiefs chunky metallic footsteps have been added, and every weapon sound has been replaced with beefier, more aggressive versions. The new Battle Rifle and sniper rifle in particular pack a satisfying wallop, but I couldve done without the more musical Covenant energy sword and overcharged plasma pistol effect. It sounds like the Jetsons car floating by. You can appreciate the contrast easily, because the audio, like the visuals, also cycles between the 2004 original versions and the 2014 remastering along with the graphics.', 'And you know what? Halo 2 remains a damn fine game, especially now that you can jump straight into Halo 3 and minimize the whiplash of that hard-stop of an ending. Bombastic set pieces like the battle on the Scarab, the Scorpion tank trek across the bridge, and the Banshee run near the end all mix with a plot that ably weaves the parallel stories of Master Chief and the Arbiter. Phenomenal new cutscenes not only breathe new life into the plot, but make me long for a feature-length CG Halo film. The best example is the stunning Gravemind scene. What was an unintentionally hilarious conversation with a featureless brown worm is now a dramatic confrontation with the hideous amalgamation of all Flood parasites, rendered here in disgusting detail.', '', '', 'The other three included Halo games all run at 60fps too, but all suffer from the same noticeable, but far from crippling framerate dips. That doubled speed gives the campaigns and multiplayer modes alike a newfound smoothness and polished feel. All but Halo 2 run at 1080p, which still looks good at the slightly lower resolution of 1328 by 1080. Theres no going back from this smoother framerate: the Master Chief Collection is the definitive version of each of these games.', 'Its great to see the lost art of local split-screen co-op multiplayer revived here, in all four games. Its now much more playable, thanks to splitting 1080 lines of resolution between players instead of just 320, and on much larger TVs than were common a decade ago. Dont expect to maintain 60 frames per second in split-screen, though  the dips are far more frequent this way.', 'Master Chief Collections version of Combat Evolved is based off of 2011s Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary. It cant match up to Halo 2 Anniversarys Xbox One-ified upgrade, but its a whole lot better than dusting off your 2001 Xbox to replay this still-great game. Some things, like Chiefs relatively short jump height and inability to board vehicles, feel a bit archaic now. But the original Halos excellent story and still-remarkable large-scale combat sandboxes  not to mention the goosebump-inducing chanting-monks theme  make the first Halo both enjoyable and relevant in 2014.', 'Halo 3 is probably the relative low point in the looks department. It has neither the benefit of Halo CE or Halo 2s recent coat of Anniversary paint, nor of being fairly new like Halo 4. The resolution and framerate boosts do give it a nice, clean look, at least. And with the exception of that exacerbating Cortana mission, it remains arguably the series finest start-to-finish campaign, complete with an ending that retains all of its emotional punch.', 'As for Halo 4, its stunning visuals are Master Chief Collections most pleasant surprise. What was already a high point for graphics on Xbox 360 legitimately looks like it was made for Xbox One when running at 1080p and 60fps. Its sound design remains the best in the series, too, aside from the Battle Rifle. I wish itd gotten the same sound thunderous effect as Halo 2 Anniversarys version, because now it sounds like a childs toy by comparison.', 'Master Chief Collection also offers Campaign Playlists, a clever way to take advantage the fact that all four Master Chief adventures are under the same roof. Whether youre playing the last levels of each campaign back-to-back or consecutively tackling every tank mission on the disc, theyre a clever addition  particularly in local or online co-op.', '', '', 'Tragically, online functionality has been extremely messy in the days following Master Chief Collections launch. Ive seen everything from extended matchmaking wait times to being dumped into a seemingly random map and gametype option that wasnt voted for. Additionally, crashes to desktop, freezes, parties being split up into separate teams, uneven team pairings, and custom-game oddities like mixing up the teams when time you come out of a match mean that, for the time being, you have to wrestle with Master Chief Collection just to play it online. Its a true shame that, for now, Halo 2 was easier to play with your friends a decade ago than it is today on exponentially more powerful hardware and a more robust Xbox Live.', 'When it works like its supposed to, as it did at a pre-release review event and hopefully will for everyone one day soon, Master Chief Collections massive multiplayer suite makes me happy. Thats primarily because it gives me two things Ive waited years for: the ability to play Halo 2 on Xbox Live again and the chance to play the original Halos groundbreaking multiplayer online (which even Halo CE Anniversary spectacularly failed to give). Its here, and on dedicated servers, no less (in matchmaking; custom games are peer-to-peer, as they always were), with the multiplayer modes of Halo 3 and 4 thrown in for good measure.', 'After several hours rotating through the four multiplayer games and their combined 100-plus maps (every DLC map is here, save for all of Halo 4s subpar Spartan Ops, which is due to be added via a free update in December) Ive come to reaffirm in 2014 what I believed in 2004: Halo 2 is still the king. Running around Blood Gulch, Hang em High, or Sidewinder and three-shotting my friends with Halo CEs lethal default pistol is nostalgically satisfying, but Halo 2 made such a leap in terms of gameplay and features that it makes Halo CE feel its age more than the others.', 'Perhaps Halo 2s greatest accomplishment is its incredible complement of maps, many of which remain classics. Swords-only on Lockout, 1-Flag CTF on Zanzibar, anything on Midship,  Halo 2 packs 25 maps, and 90 percent of them are gems. And long-gone but not forgotten gametypes like Fiesta are lovingly resurfaced, as are the deep customization options. For instance, I resurrected an old Coagulation map variant I created 10 years ago called Covie Gulch, which replaces the Scorpion tank with the Wraith and the Warthog with the long-absent Spectre. Its all back, with the small but annoying exceptions of no longer being able to transfer party leadership to another person in your group and the presence of open-channel voice chat instead of Halo 2s useful proximity/push-to-open-a-channel combo.', 'Elsewhere, there are six Halo 2 Anniversary maps  a separate group of remakes on top of the complete original complement of Halo 2 battlegrounds  and they deserve special mention. These half-dozen built-for-Xbox One stages are, quite literally, modern takes on some of Halo 2s best maps. They dutifully recreate the exact, welcome feel of Halo 2 in addition to the look. In fact, while its hard to complain about content when theres so much of it, the six Anniversary maps are so beautiful and fun that I really wish there were more of them  particularly since they have their own matchmaking playlist on Xbox Live.', 'Halo 3 and 4, meanwhile, also return exactly as you remember them. For all the benefit of having every Halo multiplayer here, the downside is that it really is jarring to jump from game to game in consecutive multiplayer matches. A universal control scheme option mitigates this somewhat, but that doesnt account for the mental and physical adjustments you have to make for the differences in jump heights, physics, weapons, etc. between each. The Battle Rifle appears in Halos 2, 3, and 4 for instance, but it is its own unique animal in each.', 'Finally, in the context of multiplayer, the game-unifying interface is mostly successful in helping to easily parse through so many choices. I appreciate how you can press a button to go straight back to the top menu, rather than have to repeatedly B-button your way back, step by step, if you want to go do something else. One complaint, though: it oddly fails to show you a preview of your Spartan or Elite multiplayer avatar after you build it in the very same interface.']",IGN
147,Dungeon of the Endless,12-Nov-14,Richard Cobbett,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/12/dungeon-of-the-endless-review,"['The mark of a great game isnt simply throwing a million features into a pot, but balancing them; making them work together and feel part of a coherent whole. Dungeon of the Endless absolutely nails that, with a simple premise offering much to learn. The goal on each level is the same: to find the exit and transport a crystal to power the lift to the next level. Behind each door there might be a swarm of monsters, an artefact, a socket to build a factory, or one of a few other options, with the doors acting as tacit turns in the real-time action - special ability recharges, for instance, are based not on time passing, but doors opened (much like The Binding of Isaac). Youre always pushed to move forwards, and never have quite enough supplies.', 'Its a brutal experience, with its stated difficulty options of Too Easy and Easy being entirely tongue in cheek. Theres a tutorial, but it only covers the absolute basics, and the initial learning curve is both a bit too steep and makes it easy to overlook important elements like levelling up heroes with food instead of simply healing them or kitting them out with improved gear. The options arent hidden, but theres a lot going on to keep track of.', 'Thats because Dungeon of the Endless is a game of climbing through levels, but more than that its one about peeling back layers. At first glance, its a roguelike; a randomly generated, science- fiction dungeon to explore one room at a time. Peel back. Now those rooms have to be lit to prevent them from spawning monsters, but theres no way to do so for more than a handful at a time. Peel back. Now those powered rooms play host to tower defence action, where you build weapons and support structures to protect your team of two heroes. Then four heroes. At this point, Dungeon of the Endless could easily stop. It doesnt. Its got many layers left to go.', 'Provided you can get over its introductory hump though, its the kind of difficulty that you can conquer simply by playing, getting a little further each time and enjoying the small victories. Playable heroes, for instance, are unlocked not by simply meeting them, but by surviving three levels with them, and each offer their own subtleties. A fast runner like Sara Numas (no relation to Samus Aran...) isnt as effective in combat as someone like Gork Not Arnie/Duke Nukem Koroser, but can be a great help when trying to rush the crystal to the exit past the sudden swarm of aliens that begins as soon as you pick it up. Theres also an element of synergy to handle. The plot is that everyone arrived on a crashed prison ship, so some characters are guards and lawmen, and others newly escaped convicts. Along with their basic weapons and skills, that adds both stat- and story-based issues to assembling teams for dungeon runs.', 'Every decision, though, is a balancing act, from whether to leave heroes by the crystal to prevent enemy waves smashing it while youre at the other end of the map, to whether to use a factory slot in a new room to build an industry generator for creating weapons, a science one for researching toys, or a food one for healing and recruiting. Tactics soon emerge naturally, such as the realisation that you dont have to fight enemies in their rooms - theres nothing at all stopping you kiting them back into a pre-prepared deathtrap full of turrets.', 'All of this is wrapped in excellent, and very thoughtful design. A basic but outstanding demonstration is that while youre actually in-game and playing, the dark rooms and busy pixellated backgrounds can make it difficult to see doors and heroes, but youre only a spin of the mousewheel away from a clear map where everything is flagged up in strong colours - a map from which you can also issue orders to heroes to save having to pan around the whole level. It might be more realistic to need the heroes to build guns into rooms, or to only be able to do so while theyre not infested with monsters. But it wouldnt be as fluid either, and so Dungeon of the Endless lets you place them as if by magic, albeit on a timer. It also automatically powers the room if you have enough of the relevant resource, rather than insisting on that petty extra click.', 'Dungeon of the Endless - Prime Free Game of the Month', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'The main issue with Dungeon of the Endless is that its relatively limited scope - complex mechanics, but still basic objective - gets notably less compelling once the first major challenge is over and the sense of exploring the space rather than simply the mechanics has faded. There are other still spins on this goal to try though, with alternate starts including an endless-with-small-e game rather than simply set floors, and a mode that focuses on the heroes smashing their way through the dungeon rather than building defences. Simply unlocking these is a challenge in itself. That second one, for instance, doesnt just demand a winning game with a previous custom start, but doing so without losing a single hero.']",IGN

But as with similar base-building sandboxes like Dwarf Fortress and Clockwork Empires (still in Early Access), the sheer magnitude and totality of unadulterated disaster that could befall my digital denizens at virtually any moment just started to make me crack up.', 'I mean, sometimes you need a good chuckle to keep from crying. Right?', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', 'From the outset, DF-9 challenged me to plop down a colony in high orbit with nothing but three dubiously qualified astronauts on a fixed oxygen supply, a bargain-bin power unit, and some handheld construction tools. Though I largely set my own goals, the gist was to create a livable environment capable of welcoming new colonists and surviving disasters that range from terrifying, Alien-style parasites to marauding neer-do-wells with laser guns.', 'My first crew didnt even need a disaster to bring about their demise, however, as they ran out of O2 before I could figure out how to get life support working. Thats how I learned most of what I now know about running a remote space habitation: Well, everybodys dead now. I guess I should try something different next time. Its rewarding in the same way as Kerbal Space Program, or trying to cook anything that involves more than three steps. I failed spectacularly, sometimes humorously, and gained a deeper understanding of what I needed to do to be successful. There is a bare-bones tutorial that briefly outlines some best practices, but it provided me little meaningful instruction in comparison to the School of Oh Gods, Our Food Replicator Just Exploded And Caused A Hull Breach!', 'Once I mastered the art of keeping a couple of people alive, at least occasionally, I stumbled into a research-based progression system. Having a few of my more talented citizens hammer away at some expensive-looking science consoles allowed me to upgrade my security forces with better weapons and armor, cure newly discovered space diseases, and unlock new building options. The list of possible projects is far from exhaustive, though; they tended to only unlock incremental upgrades for things I already had rather than opening up new gameplay possibilities. But as unforgiving as the random encounters could be, just surviving long enough to finish out the tech tree felt like a good benchmark for success in itself.', 'The problem is that the encounter system delivers its ample doses of sadism at such a breakneck pace that every passing hour seems like a losing fight against entropy. A single raid by a couple space pirates could leave me with a third of my base dead or maimed, even with an experienced security force. I was rarely given time to breathe before a meteor shower, or more pirates, or a catastrophic toaster malfunction kicked my colony while it was down. I almost never felt like I could enjoy an era of prosperity in between crises. Even games as harrowing as Dwarf Fortress dont flay you alive so constantly.', 'Options for dealing with these unwanted incursions are so limited that I was left feeling helpless. Every citizen is assigned a job, from miner to botanist, that grants them a set of skills and tools. Only security personnel have any meaningful ability to defend themselves from enemies, and there is no mechanic that encourages squishy civilians to seek shelter when the space-crap hits the space-fan. They just run around and get shot. I ultimately discovered that the best way to survive an attack was to temporarily conscript 100 percent of my population into the security forces, so theyd at least get a phaser, until the hostiles were dealt with. This was followed by the tedious process of trying to remember what job each of my sometimes dozens of colonists had before taking up arms, and trying to get everyone back to work maintaining the economy of the base.', 'Without a Raise Militia or Stand Down order, the real sense of dread from such an attack was the knowledge that Id have to go through that process again. Similar quality-of-life features are lacking across the board; among the most prominent was the inability to rotate the isometric camera, an inconvenience which often led to rooms being laid out differently from what Id intended. At times, I was forced to build an object in a sub-optimal space because intervening objects would make it harder to click on from the fixed perspective I had to work with. Also missing are the various overlays and info spreadsheets on the health and status of my colonists that would have given me much-needed insight into the efficacy of my administration. The data is all there, there just isnt any way to look at it in a clean, unified section of the interface.']",IGN
149,Dragon Age: Inquisition,11-Nov-14,Vince Ingenito,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/11/dragon-age-inquisition-review,"['Ninety hours. Thats how long it took me to roll the credits on Dragon Age: Inquisition. Though its true that quality cant be measured purely in terms of quantity, that number is still significant. Thats part of why Inquisition is not only one of the most expansive RPGs Ive ever played, but one of the few that successfully fills its gorgeous, massive world with meaningful things to do and see. A frustratingly vague plot and typical BioWare bugginess drag it down a bit, but both in combat and out, Inquisition marks a welcome return to the RPG depth that made Dragon Age: Origins and Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic so magnetic.', 'In Dragon Age: Inquisition, you arent just the leader of some merry band of adventurers, but the focal point of a sweeping, large-scale movement to bring reform and order to a land ripped apart by civil war and political strife. Literally, in a way, as interdimensional demon-spewing rifts are tearing holes in the sky across the world. Your organization has tons of tiny moving parts to manage, but major actions, such as scouting new regions and undertaking new story missions, require power - a central resource thats doled out for doing nearly anything of note across Inquisitions nine large areas. Its a brilliant idea that gives purpose to all the side-questing and sightseeing by directly tying it to story progression.', ""Some of Inquisition's regions seemed restrictive, even corridor-like when I initially set foot in them, but they soon opened up into vast sandboxes. No matter how many demon-spawning rifts I closed, or hidden shards I found, I always felt like I was making tiny dents on the tip of an iceberg. Thats not to say it lacks a sense of progression; the way you start as a band of upstart rebels and grow into a highly influential martial and political force is one of Inquisitions most satisfying traits. Its just that the sheer volume of content borders on overwhelming. Thankfully, a handy quest map makes it easy to track each regions content, which allowed me to focus my attention on a set goal... at least until wanderlust inevitably set in."", 'And boy, did it set in often. The diverse landscapes of Ferelden and Orlais strike a smart balance between open spaces and narrow, directed paths. Unclaimed keeps and unexplored ranges on the horizon kept tempting me away from my current story objective, while clearly marked pathways kept me from ever feeling truly lost. In fact, I never once felt like Id hit a dead end, because you can barely walk in any direction for a minute without stumbling upon something to do  and amazingly, none of it ever feels like filler.', 'Thats partly because of how good of a job Inquisition does of contextualizing its many pieces. Whether its with a well-delivered piece of dialogue or a smartly-written bit of supporting lore, every quest you undertake has an air of being something more important than the simple fetch or kill task it actually is. But better still, it all leads to tangible rewards through a series of well-designed crafting and progression systems that give Inquisitions huge body of content the spine and structure required to keep me engaged. Completing a cursory task for a farmer may open up new mounts for you and your party to ride, and making the right conversation choices with a seemingly unimportant NPC might lead to empire-wide bonuses. You never know how even your smallest actions might impact your experience, which gives further purpose to all the scouring and scrapping you do out in the field.', 'Not that said scrapping needs much incentive beyond the excitement it provides. Inquisitions new tactical view lets you pause and give orders at will from an overhead perspective, much like you could in Dragon Age: Origin on PC. It takes a little getting used to, especially when the camera decides to misbehave, but once you come to grips with it, it becomes a powerful tool for coordinating your party. You can hang back and set traps for over-zealous enemies, have your rogue creep along the edge of the battlefield to go for flanking bonuses, orchestrate explosive ability combos between party members, and much more. Inquisition successfully marries the measured approach of old-school BioWare games with the flashier, action-oriented approach of Dragon Age 2 and the later Mass Effect games. The result is combat that feels pleasingly punchy when controlled directly, and tactically sound when played like a puppeteer.', 'Like most BioWare games before it, Inquisition isnt without its fair share of technical annoyances. Dialogue sequences would occasionally hang, interface elements would suddenly stop working, and sound would randomly cut out in the middle of battle. Most of these could be fixed with a quick reload, but those interruptions still took me out of the experience a little too often. A day-one patch is supposed to remedy many of these issues, but if you plan to play without updating, youre in for a bumpy ride.', 'Where Inquisition really stumbles, though, is in its story. It gets off to a vague start, and never really congeals. The Dragon Age universe is rich with impressively nuanced lore and socio-political intrigue, but Inquisition lacks the heart and pathos of BioWares best games. There are some interesting individual beats, but the how and why thats supposed to connect them is all very tenuous. Its a shame too, because all the main characters are well-written and acted - particularly Dorian, whose familial struggles provided some genuinely emotional moments. By the time the story reached its climax though, I cared about the people involved, but I had little connection to what was at stake, or Inquisitions completely forgettable villain.', 'Ultimately, the tale I was truly invested in was the one I carved out with not only the major story decisions I made, but where I spent my time, who I spent it with, and how I chose to run the Inquisition. In the war room, little mini-stories played out as I decided which of my advisors should handle different tasks, the outcomes changing depending on their aptitudes. In the the throne room Id sit and pass judgement on those Id brought to justice during previous quests. Who do I execute? Who do I exile? Who gets a second chance? Combined with the excellent party banter, content like this ensured that my story remained interesting even after the curtain had fallen on the main campaign.', 'One more thing to do after finishing the campaign is the surprisingly good online co-op, which has you leveling a totally separate character up to plow through a variety of dungeons with friends. It leverages the campaigns enjoyable combat, and even the full-featured crafting system to boot. It isnt a primary reason to buy Inquisition by any means, but it does boost its already substantial replay value considerably without imposing itself on you if you just want to play single-player.']",IGN

Yet theres a reason why year-on-year, football fanatics spend countless hours helplessly glued to it: its absorbing mix of micromanagement and tactical planning has a habit of making hours feel like minutes. With recent releases, developer Sports Interactive has shied away from wholesale changes but, with Football Manager 2015, theyve delivered a refreshing aesthetic and systematic shake-up.', 'The rewarding core philosophy of FM remains the same: pick your favoured side and try to lead them to glory by improving the squad, training and managing the team effectively on and off the pitch, and using your tactical expertise to best your opponents.', 'FM2015 reverts to a sidebar as its main method of navigation and, after a short adjustment period with new menu structures, I found that most actions were quicker to get to relative to last years version; certainly no more than one to three clicks in most cases. More data is squeezed onto screens, but somehow its still wonderfully clean, readable, and presented in a manner more user-friendly than before. For example, some raw numbers have been replaced with visual indicators. The best of these is in team selection, where dropping a player onto your team-sheet provides a much clearer, colour-coded icon to show their efficiency in the chosen position. Such things help speed up seasons greatly.', 'With FM, you can go as deep into formations, mentalities, and player roles as you feel comfortable. Newcomers could rely on the advice of their Assistant Manager for team selections and team talks, while Ive personally always been hands-off with training, happy for my coaching staff to oversee development as I focus on signing talent and plotting the downfall of opponents. If youre more experienced, then FM2015 can become incredibly complex, and with new player roles and instructions to discover, such as options to allow central midfielders to play with more freedom and new ways for wingers to hurt opposition by drifting inside or exploiting space, you can get really down to the tiniest detail to outsmart your rivals.', 'When embarking on a career, FM2015 provides more options to help tailor the experience to your own style. As well as stating your professional experience, youre now asked to decide whether youll be a Tracksuit Manager, where youll spend more time tinkering with your squads training regimes, or a Tactical Manager, which has a heavier focus on strategic foresight. Its a nice touch that takes into account the different, real-life management styles in world football, but it doesnt have to be a binary decision. Theres great flexibility that allows you to sit in the middle of both styles, or alternatively you can dictate how strong you are in attributes across the roles by distributing points as you see fit, and your decisions directly affect the information immediately available to you and how those around the club interact with you.', '', ""Somewhere a FIFA fan's mind just exploded."", 'Managing your squad has always been about more than just putting players in correct positions; they have individual personalities, needs, and career goals. In real-life, the under-fire Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli is regarded as a confidence player, so including him in the half-time hair dryer treatment when things arent going well only serves to demotivate. Instead, using an individual chat to offer gentle encouragement and a virtual arm around the shoulder proved a more effective approach in his case.', 'The thing is, youre no longer restricted to offering nuggets of motivation pre-game and at half-time; you can shout at your team at any time during a match. You could be having a decent spell of attacking momentum and want the players to push forward, or maybe theyve just scored and youre worried about complacency, so you can remind them to concentrate. If one player isnt performing well, you could pull just them aside and demand for more. It adds another level of agency to mid-match tactic tinkering and went a long way to mentally putting me in the technical area.', 'In the past Ive quickly grown tired of meetings attended throughout the season, but thankfully theyre better paced and have more variety in both questions and responses and, generally, they just feel more necessary. Admittedly, once Id settled into a rhythm, a touch of repetition did set in, and this was especially true of time spent with the press. Like players, though, reporters now have personalities and agendas. Trashy tabloids will will provoke you on contentious match events or opposition performances, attempting to engineer rivalries. Its impressively done and lets you get involved in the sort of sporting drama and narratives that we all enjoy discussing in real-life.', 'Regardless of whether youre talking to press or staff, your responses need to be measured; get drawn into a public argument with Mourinho and you could potentially spur his side on and lose the respect of yours. Fail to keep promises to players who have come to you for help or reassurance, and you might end up with a severely demotivated side, which will show on the pitch. Everything in FM2015 requires a balance; everything you do has fascinating repercussions. This is why I get so invested in it.', '', ""Where's the door?"", 'The 3D match engine has been imbued with stronger animations and player models, and while its still hampered by some awkward player skating, matches are smoother and feel more atmospheric thanks to nifty visual enhancements. Crowds behave more animatedly, for example, adding a much needed sense of life to match-day. Youll also see banners strewn around the grounds, stewards guarding the tunnels, substitutes warming up on the touchline. On the pitch, players are now visibly affected by weather conditions, getting muddy and wet during rain or snow, while footballers used to warmer climes don gloves during the colder seasons. Such things sound superfluous, but it makes for a more satisfying, authentic match-day experience.', 'The Classic mode - a triumph in recent years - returns, once again offering a simplified career for those that just want to sign players, set tactics, and play through seasons quickly without bloat. Thanks to features like instant results, its an ideal starting point for beginners and those that dont have that much time. This year, you have a little more control should you want it, as youre able to take over training right down to an individual player level and interact more generally with your team. I also appreciated the option to skip pre-season; exactly the sort of thing I want from a mode designed to get me into action quickly.', 'Lastly, Challenge mode is back too. Using the Classic engine, Challenge mode tasks you with battling through misfortune in a number of fun scenarios, such as a financial or injury crisis, or surviving your job with a toxic dressing room. Its a nice little aside thats perfect for bite-size FM sessions.']",IGN

Yes, it is an adaptation of the current and popular Nickelodeon TV show, but theres little actual life and soul to it. It feels like a competent but rudimentary 2D action game with the various skins of characters from the Ninja Turtles universe draped over it.', 'So much of the appeal of the Ninja Turtles universe is seeing how its characters all interact and work together to solve problems, so of course none of that is represented here. In Danger of the Ooze, characters like April ONeil and Leatherhead only ever appear for brief scenes, typically just long enough to warn of danger and reward the Turtles with new abilities. The story itself isnt much more than a half-baked goose chase of trying to keep a mutagenic weapon out of the wrong hands, and these random and poorly lip-synched character appearances only add to the insult when they play out like obligatory nods at best. A complete lack of personality makes the attachment of the Turtles characters and the expectations they carry with them a detriment rather than a bonus.', 'The direction developer Way Forward took with the action and character progression, however, is one I really appreciated. Danger of the Ooze is a game of the Metroidvania-style level design school, meaning that new areas of the map become accessible as you unlock new abilities that allow you to overcome obstacles.', 'The pace at which new abilities unlock works really well, with a natural buildup of each taking place throughout. Controls are the same across each of the four playable turtles, although they do have distinct moves and combos fitting their weapons.  Throwing stars come first, followed shortly by dashing, double jumping, and a handful of other upgrades necessary for not only fully exploring the map, but also making combat much more approachable. Throwing stars are eventually upgraded with shock and incendiary properties, while the turtles powerful special attacks and the ability to dash, double-jump, and climb rough surfaces allowed for varied options in traversing the map. It all unfolds fairly seamlessly, with each ability building on the last somewhat significantly.', 'This feeling of power was refreshing, but often undone by the infuriating amount of backtracking and lack of meaningful checkpoints throughout the map. Backtracking is definitely an integral part of this style of game, but traversing all the way across the map only to die and be reset at the opposite end happens too frequently.', '\n', '', '', '', '', 'Deaths werent cheap, at least, as theres an obvious amount of care poured into each enemy encounter, with a wide variety of enemy types and attack patterns. Different Foot Ninjas attack with varied ranged and melee attacks, certain Kraang enemies can follow movement and fire weapons virtually everywhere, bosses have nicely varied attacks and weaknesses, and a nice mix of both on-foot and aerial enemies makes each encounter feel like its own sort of challenging puzzle. But once youve figured a puzzle out, solving it again becomes a chore, and constant respawns mean having to fight through the same encounters every time you backtrack across the streets of New York and the sewers beneath. Each pass through the same location became more tedious than the last, and even though Danger of the Ooze is only five hours long, it wore thin quickly.', 'These design choices left me wondering what audience Danger of the Ooze is meant to appeal to. Its much too difficult for children (theres no easy setting), and while I enjoyed some of its harrowing challenge as an adult fan, its meager service to the source material is a constant disappointment.']",IGN
152,Depth,12-Nov-14,TJ Hafer,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/12/depth-review,"['Eating friends alive is a uniquely satisfying experience. Even an across-the-map, no-scope headshot in Battlefield doesnt tickle the same gloat centers in my brain. Thus, playing as a great white shark in Depths asymmetrical bloodsport was gleefully delicious.', 'Playing as one of the two man-eating sharks that stalk the four human divers in each match is definitely the star of the show. Navigating swiftly and silently in third-person perspective, I quickly developed a sense that these oceans were mine to lord over. The sluggish, clumsy humans huddled in groups as they inched their way from treasure stash to to treasure stash, knowing I was out there somewhere, but never sure from what direction Id attack, or when. Regular sonar pulses showed me outlines of my prey, allowing me to keep tabs on them at great distances. Its reminiscent of playing as the Infected in Left 4 Dead, or the Alien gameplay in the old Aliens vs Predator 2 multiplayer: speed, stealth, and a superior awareness of the environment were my primary advantages.', 'The humans brought numbers, hardware, and ranged weaponry to the table in response. Playing from first-person and handicapped by a deliberately-limited sight range, the intrepid landlubbers are forced to use all of these tools to survive. Starting with a basic pistol, divers unlock progressively more potent guns and utility items by gathering and turning in treasure in an interface similar to Counter-Strikes gear market. Having net guns and fully automatic firepower is nice, but the real key to diver gameplay is making good use of items like sonar beacons and concealed mines that grant an early warning of an approaching maneater and, potentially, blow it up before it gets a chance to take a bite out of anyones juicy abdomen.', 'As the shark, I found myself in a dynamic cat-and-mouse game as the rounds progressed. Successful sharksmanship became a matter of knowing when to strike, using paranoia as a weapon, and getting the hell out of the line of fire with my supper before said suppers friends could take revenge. As the sharks are always outnumbered and, thankfully for us dirt dwellers, still not immune to bullets, frontal assaults were almost always a one-way ticket to the Belly-Up Ball. As with any horror-movie aquatic menace, the less I was seen, the better. Performing swift passes by windows and cracks in the wall to distract the divers proved very effective, as did planning my attack vector on a straight line between two exits, with my target right in the middle.', 'When playing for the edible team, I had to trade in my rows of razor-sharp teeth for a SCUBA mask and a more developed prefrontal cortex, which changed the atmosphere completely. I felt slow, exposed, and under-equipped as we escorted our treasure-hauling, mechanical companion S.T.E.V.E. through the oppressive, deep-sea environments. Moving methodically, I found I often had less than a second to react between seeing the first flash of fins and meeting my crunchy demise. Awareness and teamwork were my only insurance policies, and vision-enhancing items like chemlights and tracer rounds (which can stick to a shark and allow it to be tracked at a distance) proved to be the most crucial elements in my arsenal.', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', 'Advertisement', 'Playing as a diver creates a tension that gives even most single-player horror games a run for their money. Theres something deeply unsettling about being surrounded by water, unable to see more than a few meters around me, and knowing theres something out there faster and stronger than me that knows exactly where I am at all times. Its the same feeling I got jumping into a lake as a kidI couldnt see how deep it was, or what other creatures were in there with me. My imagination became my worst enemy.', 'The excellent sound design enhances all of this. With a good pair of around-ear headphones, I could easily imagine myself submerged as the ambience of the deep sea swirled around me. When a shark comes within a certain radius, youre warned by the sound of your own heartbeat starting to accelerate, making it more difficult to keep your cool and be ready for an attack.', 'Match to match, both sharks and divers can unlock new weapons and upgrades. These must still be purchased within each match (with gold for divers, and kills for sharks), but it gives at least some sense of persistent progression. The extra hardware and predatory adaptations I earned opened up some interesting, new gameplay styles, but each match still ultimately felt like it came down to the same sets of tactics. Each shark and each diver filled, essentially, the same role. Theres no way to represent your progress to other players, either -  visual customization is entirely absent for sharks, and is limited to a selection of three pre-set skins for divers.', '', 'Just keep swimming, just keep swimming...', 'The most disappointing section of the proverbial seafood menu was the lack of gameplay modes. The Team Fortress 2 Payload-style, escort-the-drone-and-collect-gold routine started to feel a little monotonous in the absence of any other options, and I couldnt help but feel that the core mechanics arent being used to their broadest and most creative potential. All the variety comes from the huge tonal and tactical differences between diver and shark gameplay, and the ability to simply switch teams and feel like I was playing a different game if I needed a quick change of pace kept me deep into Depth for a bit longer.']",IGN
153,Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas,31-Oct-14,Dave Rudden,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/31/gta-san-andreas-hd-review,"[""For a game with such a big world, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas starts in a pretty personal place. In the first mission, Carl Johnson silently mourns his recently deceased mother. Thanks to the upgraded textures and higher resolution (all the way up to 720p!), I could see pain in his face that wasn't apparent a decade ago. In the second, CJ reunites with his estranged brother and sister, but the audio cut out after a few seconds, interrupting the bittersweet moment. That's a pretty good encapsulation of what this re-release of San Andreas brings to the table: its the same great story and setting, bolstered by relatively sharp visuals but also hamstrung by new technical issues."", ""Just about every Grand Theft Auto since the series went 3D attempts to mix emotion with carnage and comedy, but none has nailed the balance as well as San Andreas. Carl Johnson's adventure has plenty of betrayal and redemption, but there's plenty of good-natured ribbing amongst friends as well as offbeat interactions with some of the city's weirder inhabitants, like a weak-willed hardcore rapper and a conspiracy spouting hippie. The range of activities also runs the gamut; while the running, gunning, and driving of previous GTAs is still at the heart of San Andreas, the amount of physical activities, minigames, and gambling just a short drive away is still impressive today."", ""Most extracurricular activities are quickly introduced and rarely overstay their welcome, save San Andreas' insistence on making CJ's health reliant on side activities like working out and visiting restaurants. It's worth noting that this is the first Xbox version of San Andreas to incorporate Achievements, so if notifications and meta-points happen to give you additional motivation, you might find additional reason to explore, experiment, and complete the campaign."", ""When it comes to that campaign, San Andreas is a bit less of a hassle than it used to be. While the auto-aiming system remains as troublesome as ever and some of the missions you'll have to complete can be amongst the series' hardest (particularly the train-chasing sequence with Big Smoke, and Zero's maddening RC helicopter escapades), but a new checkpoint system allows for immediate retries after a failed mission. The two key benefits are that you don't need to worry about the loss of weaponry and armor that comes with being arrested, or endure the sometimes-long drive of shame back to the mission marker. In a few cases, you can even pick up midway through an objective. Those cases are rarer than they should be, however given how long some missions run, boring drives from the mission start point still happen far too frequently. Even though it's a far cry from the retry-friendly checkpoints in GTA V, San Andreas' system is way better than it was a decade ago."", ""The same can't be said about the UI, which has been directly lifted from the iOS version of San Andreas. Finding a particular bit of info, whether it be a stat, option, or objective takes an extra button press than before (whereas you'd previously just scroll through the categories and see the information), and the map is confusingly omnipresent, but the menu buttons and can't be moved until you activate it with the back button. You'll have to do that often, as the static section of the map rarely fits in enough of the world to discern a proper path to your destination amongst San Andreas' entwined highways and loopy dirt roads."", ' ', ""The sights and sounds of San Andreas are the best they've ever been on consoles, but those come with the biggest caveats. While improved textures make the world more vibrant, signs more readable, and characters (slightly) less puppet-like, you'll have to deal with a surprisingly choppier framerate. It's usually manageable, only really manifesting when the camera is moved around quickly or too many cars are on the road, but it can become distracting when it plays out during action sequences. There's also that issue of audio suddenly muting during cutscenes roughly 10 percent of the time, which is stranger than the graphical issues since San Andreas' epic soundtrack and star-studded vocal performances haven't been altered.""]",IGN

WWE 2K15 on Xbox 360 is emblematic of that. Just one year removed from 2K14, which delivered the most comprehensive roster, the deepest history, and the biggest creation suite to date, 2K15's old-gen version takes significant steps backwards in each of those areas."", ""The old-gen version of 2K15 doesn't have most of the new-gen additions you may have heard about. The revamped, more realistic match pacing is nowhere to be found here. The addition of a momentum meter is much appreciated though, removing the guesswork as to when signatures become available and when the window is closing to pull one off before it becomes a finisher. Aside from that, it's the same standard high-speed action that's become commonplace for the franchise over the last few years. The old combat engine isn't inherently bad, mind you. When it comes to standard matches with two to four combatants it's certainly enjoyable, though a bit too reliant on mastering reversals or spamming the unnaturally quick strikes. But get into five or six-man everything-goes matches however, and the fast-paced fighting ceases to approximate anything resembling an actual wrestling match."", 'The 2K Showcase mode is the biggest chunk of new content in 2K15, and while it isn\'t quite the nostalgia farm that 2K14\'s 30 Years of WrestleMania was, it does provide a mostly comprehensive look at two major feuds; the Triple H-Shawn Michaels rivalry that ran from 2002 to 2004, and the CM Punk-John Cena feud that kicked off the modern ""Reality Era"" in 2011. There\'s a handful of throwaway DQ and no-contest finishes from Raw and Smackdown that probably didn\'t need to be included though, and the complete lack of WrestleMania bouts like Punk vs Undertaker, or Triple H vs Booker T is sad. Still, Showcase ultimately lands a little closer to the ""every match matters"" feel of last year\'s 30 Years of WrestleMania than the slew of forgettable recreations peppered throughout WWE \'13\'s Attitude Era mode.', ""Unfortunately, the Who Got NXT mode is little more than filler. Its basically a list of four historical matches for each of the five NXT roster members in WWE 2K15. That's already a bit of a letdown, but more luster is lost when you consider that only two of the group are still in the developmental league. Additionally, none of the talent in their standout women's division are highlighted, nor are NXT favorites like Tyler Breeze and Aiden English."", ""Where 2K Showcase managed to shine a light on matches I'd never seen with cutscenes and in-depth commentary, Jerry Lawler and Michael Coles commentary fails to provide proper insight into NXT history, to the extent that I couldn't even remember matches in the mode that I'd seen on TV less than a year ago. It's partially because Who Got NXT doesn't give each feud a proper video package or even an in-engine cinematic during matches, but Lawler and Cole also lack the authoritative voice that the actual NXT announcers would have brought to the mode."", ""The bigger issue, however is the mode's difficulty spikes. There's no set difficulty for Who Got NXT, so some trickier objectives like winning a ladder match without letting your opponent touch the title, winning by submission without using a finisher, or pulling off a move that requires three stored finishers are tougher than they have any right to be. While it's nice that you're given more context than ever before when it comes to performing specific objective, both Showcase and NXT modes occasionally fail to acknowledge when you've completed them, which adds to the frustration."", ""With 63 Superstars, eight Divas, and three managers, 2K15's roster is WWE's smallest and least diverse in years. What new characters have been added generally look pretty good; particularly Goldust, Bray Wyatt, and the NXT Superstars. Little has been done to fix older characters, though, so Santino still looks like he's just come back from root canal surgery, and Dolph Ziggler's mouth remains twice the size of a normal human one. Collision detection is worse than ever, so expect even more physics-defying limbs, weapons, and ropes. In particular, every single time I picked up the ring bell to clock an opponent, it seemed to be grafted into the holder's wrist."", 'On the bright side, the announcing outside of Who Got NXT is quite well-done. You can really tell that Lawler and Cole recorded a lot of new commentary lines together. In particular, their discussions at the beginning of Showcase mode matches show off their good back-and-forth chemistry, which wasn\'t really apparent in previous WWE games. Still, there is a fair amount of repetition due to dialogue from previous WWE installments. Prepare to hear ""he\'s putting his educated feet to good use"" a few hundred times more this year.', ""Characters aren't the only absentees this year - whole modes are missing. While the create-a-special-move is a slight omission, there's a bigger cut feature sure to rankle fans of VGCW: you can't create stories anymore. The WWE Universe mode does have expanded story options that you can assign to rivalries, but it's tough to figure out the parameters to unlock them. It's barely worth the effort since they're still pantomimed, and rarely personalized to specific wrestlers. It's really a poor alternative to community creations.""]",IGN
155,Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare,3-Nov-14,Brian Albert,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/03/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-review,"[""Advanced Warfare has gone to great lengths to reinvigorate Call of Duty. From the unsettling vision of powerful mercenaries run amok in 2054 America, to the cybernetically enhanced abilities, to the touch of a whole new lead development team at Sledgehammer Games, this iteration is the biggest and most successful departure from what's expected from a Call of Duty game since Modern Warfare brought the series into the 21st century. Advanced Warfare definitely hasnt discarded the excellent, fast-paced run-and-gun shooting that made Call of Duty a household name; instead, its taken that strength and committed itself completely to the idea that mobility and flexibility are king, making it faster and more focused than any Call of Duty game before it."", 'The topics and themes of Advanced Warfares futuristic single-player story are lent a gravity by their reflection of contemporary real-world news: weapons of mass destruction, a dysfunctional Congress, growing private militaries, and American interventionism. Its delivered with Call of Dutys typical over-the-top bravado, but theres a layer of truth beneath it all thats genuinely scary.', 'Actors Troy Baker and Kevin Spacey nail their roles as player character Mitchell and Atlas Corporation President Jonathan Irons, respectively. Mitchell is gruff and reserved after a personal loss, but unquestionably dangerous and loyal to those who remain. Irons speaks with unwavering confidence; hes the kind of charismatic bad guy I cant help but like. These characters, and the rest of the cast, are brought to life with some of the best character models and facial animations Ive seen. Pores, hair, and creases in skin are all rendered in great detail, to the point where I knew, just by seeing how a characters face displayed shock and horror, that bad news was coming.', 'Those faces, as well as everything else, are far less detailed on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 than on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Lighting is flatter and textures are less defined, and I didn\'t get the same ""wow"" impact out of Advanced Warfare\'s excellent looking weapons, environments, and characters on those platforms. More importantly, though, movement and shooting feel just as fast and fluid on old-gen consoles as they do on modern machines.', '\n', 'The biggest hindrance to Advanced Warfares story is the way it fails to establish its characters human relationships. For instance, the earliest interaction we see is Mitchell and a fellow Marine; were told the two are inseparable brothers in arms whove served together for months, but some of their conversations seem as though theyve just met, and come off as artificial exposition. The same thing happens when Irons gives Mitchell a tour of Atlas headquarters -- theres no way Mitchell wouldnt already know all about the worlds biggest mercenary army. And, like most Call of Duty campaigns, this one ends about six hours later with a confusing, cheesy moment that doesnt quite tie off Advanced Warfares story threads.', 'Between those story bookends, Advanced Warfare admirably takes some risks with how its campaign plays, and on nearly all fronts, it succeeds. This is still a Call of Duty game, which means you can expect a handful of the tired, stereotypical missions where the guy in front of you has a big follow me symbol above his head. Most level designs are as tightly linear as theyve ever been, however almost all come with a unique gadget that changes how you take on the somewhat repetitive human and drone enemies and keeps them feeling fresh. If youre given a sonic emitter to stun enemies, youll be able to take on larger groups. If youre given a grappling hook, you can play cat and mouse by darting around corners and on rooftops. One level lets you drive a hover tank, and one level takes place beneath a crumbling glacier.', 'A few powerful missions open up and give you some real freedom in a way thatll surprise Call of Duty campaign veterans. In Advanced Warfares stealth level, for example, I grappled onto ledges, sneaked through bushes, and scouted to find unguarded paths through heavily patrolled areas. The stealth mechanics are just nuanced enough to be tough, but not so finicky that I didnt know know why Id failed. For once, Call of Duty made me feel like a badass without needing to blow anything up. Its main failing is that being spotted causes an automatic trip back to your checkpoint, because Call of Duty doesnt know how to handle a transition from stealth to combat.', '\n', 'Whats truly impressive, though, is how Advanced Warfare occasionally pulls off what would have been a barely interactive action set piece moment in a previous game. In one level a massive airship flew into combat and fired down on me. Without a hint of a quick-time event prompt, I grappled onto a nearby building, leapt off, hooked myself into the ship, killed everyone on board, then bailed out to safety as the airship crashed. I came up with that plan, and executing it felt great. When I learned I couldve simply shot the gunship down from the ground instead, it felt even better.', 'Your arsenal is impressive, too, with a variety of mostly typical but great-sounding weapons, grenades, and, gadgets to get the job done. A few stand out, like the Threat Grenades that highlight enemies through walls, directed energy weapons (or lasers, if you will) that burn through armor, and a wide variety of weapon attachments that can turn your conventional shotgun into a fast-firing monster of death.', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'The one design decision seemingly made in the name of variety that I felt harmed my enjoyment of Advanced Warfare is that we dont get access to the full range of Exo movement abilities in every campaign level. You wont always be able to zip around freely whenever you want, and sometimes your speed is sacrificed for other gadgets. Though theyre all fun and useful in different ways, but having a liberating mobility power taken away feels crippling.', 'The Exo suit is the kind of change I was looking for in Call of Duty multiplayer. Its intuitive, fun, and it affects everything you do.', 'From the first moments I was boosting and dodging in firefights to make myself a harder target. After just a few matches, I started using my mobility to my advantage before the next fight even started. If I saw a ledge, roof, or open window, I knew I could probably leap to it quickly and get the jump on enemies below. If someone started shooting me first, I was able to creatively retreat in ways that werent possible in a Call of Duty game until now. And thats just in the context of killing. Modes like Capture the Flag feel way more intense now that the carrier can boost 40 feet in the air and disappear with a flash. I felt like I had to be on top of my game, and when I scored a kill, it felt hard-earned and well deserved.', '\n', 'My first hours were filled with satisfying new experiences as I augmented my old tactics with new abilities. Is a fortified sniper taking shots at you from across the map? Take a safe approach toward it and just use your dash to pass through the open areas with minimal risk. Does your shotgun have crazy power but no range? Boost up into an opponents face before pulling the trigger.', 'Suits also come with power slots on top of their innate boost and dash abilities in which you can equip invisibility, enhanced speed, a health boost, a grenade deflector, and more. Theyre all fun and useful in different ways, but I often found myself never using the powers that took a second to activate. When you take a fast shooter and make it even faster, that second is the difference between life and death. The powers often felt like they were going to waste. However, since the Exo is an excellent multi-purpose tool, I cant wait to see how some of the best Call of Duty players will use it.', 'Since Modern Warfare, Call of Duty has excelled at giving you rewards to earn in multiplayer. Advanced Warfare follows that tradition, but greatly accelerates the pace. I quickly earned supply drops full of cosmetic items, new weapons, and temporary perks, like a double XP boost. Finding a gun I liked was great; finding another version of that gun with better stats and a cool weapon skin is even better. There are also more attachments than ever before, and each one I unlocked did distinct things that changed how I played. One weapon sight highlights enemies through walls, essentially enabling a wall hack. These unlocks complement the traditional XP system and challenges for each specific weapon, which offer new camo patterns as you score more kills and headshots. Despite the wealth of items and skins to earn, it never feels overwhelming, and I never felt compelled to use anything I didnt want to.', '\n', 'The Pick 13 system, which expands on Black Ops 2s Pick 10, gave me all the flexibility I could ask for. For example: lots of people arent good enough to make use of some of the higher-level kills streaks, so why have them? Just get rid of the streak option all together, and use that extra slot to give your primary weapon an extra attachment or a second perk. Play how you want isnt just an ideal; its baked into Advanced Warfare at a fundamental level.', 'One of my favorite new features complements the constant stream of unlocked weapons, perks, and cosmetic items. From the lobby, one button drops you into a virtual firing range where you can safely test your new gear without fear of learning the weaknesses of a new loadout the hard way. Its convenient and extremely useful, and it should absolutely become standard in any loadout-based multiplayer shooter from here on out.', '\n', 'The new collection of maps and modes make great use of the Exo suit by enabling vertical movement. Most maps have a mixture of wide-open areas where Exo movements are useful, and close-quarters areas that enable more traditional Call of Duty action. Modes like Uplink and CTF benefit from the hectic, fast-paced Exo movements, and others, like the one-life-only Search and Destroy, rein you back and make you question jumping around wildly. I was constantly shifting between totally free motion and the careful check your corners style Ive used for years, which was demanding but ensured I never felt safe simply falling into my old Call of Duty habits.', 'If youre rusty, you can jump into the Combat Readiness Program before trying out true multiplayer. Its a noob-friendly environment where there are no kill cams, no post-game scoreboards, and a mixture of nameless bots and players. Anyone who racks up too high a body count gets locked out to avoid discouraging new players, making it a much more casual-friendly zone where you can kick back and enjoy yourself without pressure.', 'The third mode in Advanced Warfare is a wave-based cooperative mode called Exo Survival, where the fun comes from never knowing whats going to happen next. One moment youre fighting attack dogs, then youre collecting intel, then youre fending off giant robots, then youre shooting invisible enemies. Its a nice mixture of defensive and offensive objectives, and working together with up to three friends and picking complementary Exos is crucial as the waves become more difficult. The difficulty doesnt ramp up quite as quickly as it should, though, so after you spend your unlock points on upgraded suits and weapons within a round, youll do a fair bit of waiting for the challenge to kick in.', '\n']",IGN
156,Shantae and the Pirate's Curse,29-Oct-14,Scott Thompson,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/29/shantae-and-the-pirates-curse-review,"['Shantae and the Pirates Curse has all the makings of a good 2D Metroidvania platformer; clever puzzle design, progressive empowerment through new abilities, and an emphasis on exploration. Its the sharp sense of humor and vivacious world, though, that ultimately propel Pirates Curse to greatness and help it stand out from the glut of retro-inspired platformers.', 'During the 10 hours or so it took me to completely traverse its six islands, I appreciated the many nods Pirates Curse expertly makes to the classic gameplay of Metroid and Castlevania. It offers an even blend of combat and puzzle solving; youll smoothly go from whipping your enemies with Shantaes magic hair to utilizing a bevy of pirate tools to further explore the islands and their dens of evil. The pacing feels just right, and though there are gigantic bosses to slay and multi-step puzzles to solve, neither overstay their welcome.', 'The gameplay isnt entirely original, but Pirates Curse does a superb job of capturing the spirit of the Metroidvania platformer. Instead of one giant environment, Shantae must explore six disparate islands. With unique enemies and environmental hazards, I found that each island had a distinct feel that kept me from growing bored as I explored every inch of them. Harnessing the power of Shantaes increased abilities to steadily fill in each islands classic grid-based map scratches that completionist itch, and with an assortment of hidden items to discover, including optional battles that directly determine whether you get the good or bad ending, there is certainly a push to explore as much as you can. But by spreading the action across six separate locations and clearly displaying how many secrets are still undiscovered at each, the task never seemed all that overbearing. The smaller, more focused approach kept me engaged.', 'Though cutting through enemies with Shantaes hair is mostly fun, the second half of the story is bogged down by a few areas with constantly respawning enemies. Levels become filled with enemies that reappear in seconds. This isnt such an issue the first time you visit an island, but it begins to wear thin as you travel back and forth across each island multiple times. Though you can upgrade Shantaes attack, it isnt until very late in Pirates Curse that you become powerful enough to cut through the onslaught with ease. With no fast travel, or an ability to skip to specific spots on an island, things can sometimes turn into a grind.', 'Still, those brief moments of frustration are usually washed away by the strong writing and vibrant look of Pirates Curse. The dialogue is consistently funny, and readily breaks the fourth wall throughout. The offbeat humor is built into the puzzle-solving, too. In one early example, Shantae wakes a dragon with the scent of a ham, causing it to drool down the mountain its perched upon. The drool collects in a pool, which attracts a couple of spring breakers, whose pale skin reflects the sunlight onto a nearby temple wall, revealing a hidden petrification spell Shantae has been searching for. In those moments when a particular puzzle or boss left me feeling fatigued, some inane, hilarious scenario like this would pull me right back in.', 'These off-the-wall scenarios are brought to life with detailed, expressive sprites. Shantae and her enemies look sharp and move fluidly, with no slow down whatsoever. Like the characters, the majority of the environments are bright and full of life, reflecting Shantaes own carefree attitude. The colorful backgrounds and vibrant characters are especially impressive in 3D, and I kept it turned up for the entire thing. Pirates Curse is, simply, a joy to watch.', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement']",IGN
157,Fantasy Life,23-Oct-14,Meghan Sullivan,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/23/fantasy-life-review,"['Every time I tried to finish Fantasy Life, I ended up getting sidetracked. There was always just one more thing to do - a monster to slay, a dish to cook, or a wish to fulfill. If I could just get rid of that last item on my to do list, Id be satisfied. Of course, as soon as I did so, another quest would pop up, and Id just have to do that, too.', 'Therein lies the secret of Fantasy Lifes success: theres always tons of stuff to do and multiple ways to do it, and its all because of the Life Class feature. This clever gameplay mechanic combines Rune Factorys life simulation/dungeon crawling with Final Fantasy Vs multi-tiered job system to create a quest structure so addictive that I found myself fishing and fighting well into the wee hours of the night, even when a mission was hard, or the story tedious.', 'Thats not to say I disliked Fantasy Lifes story, it just has pacing issues. I enjoyed gathering peoples wishes so I could heal the world, and the tongue-in-cheek humor had me laughing throughout my 30-plus hours of playtime, about half of which was spent doing side missions (did I mention theres lots of stuff to do?). The adventure gets off to a sluggish start though, and only slightly picks up the  pace before it reaches its somewhat abrupt ending. Its a shame since the storys message is heartwarming.  But even when my journey to save the world felt slow, the Life Class system was there to make the journey well worth it.', 'At first I dismissed Life Classes as fancy rolodexes that simply organize activities like fishing and fighting into little cubbyholes. I couldnt see how this feature made Fantasy Life any different from comparable life simulators like Rune Factory or Animal Crossing. But once I dug into each Life, I found a unique set of enjoyable challenges and skill sets designed to help me become the ultimate Paladin, Chef, or Wizard.', 'For example, I could learn a new sword skill by slaying enemies on the battlefield as a Paladin, or raise my success as a Chef by playing a minigame where I rhythmically tapped the A button in order to whip up a meal before time ran out. I could even combine my Life skills to complete special tasks for people, like using my hunting skills to forage for honey, then using my prowess as a gourmet chef to make them a honey pudding. Being able to do so many different things in so many different ways kept things fresh and interesting, and I loved that I could swap between vocations at any time (there are 12 in all), since it meant I rarely had to do the same thing for too long.', 'Mastering a Life proved to be quite the challenge. Every time I achieved a higher Life rank, the next set of career-oriented tasks got tougher - a lot tougher. Monsters began to hit like a ton of bricks, ingredients for recipes were harder to find, and I had to frantically race the clock to craft an item before time ran out. his uptick in difficulty kept me alert and engaged, though toward the end some of these challenges began to feel redundant. There was only so many times I could enjoy cobbling shoes or fighting the same enemies.', 'Luckily, connecting with friends via multiplayer made checking things off of my to-do list easier and more enjoyable. It was great being able to team up with other people to take down a fire-breathing dragon, or ask them for a pinch of salt that would help me on my road to becoming the worlds greatest chef. And if friends werent available to take on my adventures, I could choose two AI companions to help me in combat, who Im happy to report are actually reasonably intelligent. I never had to prompt an AI character to heal or attack, though they did occasionally run into walls while following me around.', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement']",IGN
158,The Legend of Korra,21-Oct-14,Dan Stapleton,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/21/the-legend-of-korra-the-game-review,"['Looking at the faithful art style of this Legend of Korra game, which comes from reputable developer Platinum, the optimist in me had high hopes that it would make good use of the Avatar: The Last Airbender universe and its awesome elemental-infused martial-arts superpowers. It turns out to be much closer to what my inner cynic expected: a poorly made tie-in that cant even stand up as a competent third-person action game, much less something I could recommend to a fan of the show. What a disappointment.', 'As youd expect from a rote video game adaptation, the ""story"" has Avatar Korra immediately robbed of her water, earth, fire, and air-bending powers and forces her to reactivate them one at a time. And as youd expect, combat against generic, mostly palette-swapped enemies is painfully simplistic (though it is challenging) and takes place in a series of bland, featureless arenas. Its especially bad in the first few hours of its approximately five-hour campaign.', 'Every move Korra has is executed with a combination of just the X and Y buttons, with the triggers dedicated to countering on the left and dodging on the right  so its inherently button-mashy. To be fair, it does get better over time. Once Id gotten the hang of its annoyingly short counter timing windows and leveled up my bending skills I was able to pull off some attack strings that resembled the beatdowns Korra delivers to her adversaries in the show. Freezing them in ice, blowing them away in a whirlwind, blasting them with fireballs, and crushing them with boulders is impressively animated, so long as the enemies dont glitch out. It just never felt that good, even with the elaborate quick-time event finishing moves, and it took until I began my second playthrough of a game I didnt really want to finish the first time to unlock enough moves for it to become remotely rewarding.', 'Enemy variety isnt terrible, but their baffling lack of resistances or vulnerabilities to any specific element means you almost never have to vary your attacks. I used water for distant or flying foes, earth for bashing them up close, air for crowd control, and fire for when I wanted to lose. Whats more, theres no incentive to mix things up to create multiple-element combos. That seems like a waste, given that youre the Avatar.', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'Perhaps the most offensive part about The Legend of Korra: The Game is that, as a fan of the show, I could barely detect a hint of the wit and charm that makes its characters endearing. Thats partially because there essentially is no writing - just short, repetitive bursts of uncharacteristic and unimaginative smack-talk - and partially because Korra is effectively the only character who appears at all. A completely unanimated and badly voice-impersonated Jinora floats around giving advice on how to unlock your powers; Sidekicks Mako and Bolin show up for literally 15 seconds in an early cutscene before being knocked off screen and out of the game; Iroh has two lines of dialogue that repeat every time you visit the item store; Tenzin, Asami, Lin, Meelo, Ikki, Bumi, and the rest are complete no-shows. In fact, even the cutscenes are poor  they look to be animated at about 10 frames per second and feel slightly off-model. Its embarrassing.', 'A close second on the terribleness scale is Irohs item store. This is a fairly tough game on normal difficulty, and I was routinely beaten up by earth, fire, and water-bending enemies until I got some decent moves. Thatd be fine, except for that when you die, all of the health potions and buffs youve used (and the points you used to acquire them) stay gone. That means they must be repurchased and re-equipped every single time, or you cant heal at all. Its a genuinely stupid system. You can even end up in a situation where one of the obnoxiously durable and repetitious bosses kills you enough that you run out of money and have to fight with no healing ability whatsoever, or go back to an earlier stage and grind for currency.', ""The Legend of Korra: The Game isnt all combat, though when Id played the endless-runner minigame interjected every few levels I wished it was. Its actually not a terrible endless runner, but the addition of a few bending-themed powers like fireballs to destroy obstacles and launching yourself into the air with earth-bending doesn't make it a good one either, and it looks absurd to see Korra riding her polar bear/dog hybrid mount Naga as she makes disorienting 90-degree turns at high speed. Tacking on another mediocre mode of play doesnt improve this game - and that goes for the Pro Bending minigame, too.""]",IGN
159,Screencheat,26-Oct-14,Mikel Reparaz,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/26/screencheat-review,"[""Like a lot of older gamers, I have fond memories of playing split-screen shooters on a couch with friends  and also of surreptitiously glancing over at those friends' screens, so I could find and annihilate them. It wasn't something I was supposed to do, of course, and generally frowned upon as cheating. Screencheat turns that cheat into a necessary survival tactic. Simple, colorful, and fun in short bursts, Screencheat is a multiplayer-only first-person shooter that's all about small arenas, bizarre weapons, and everyone being invisible all the time. And because everyone's invisible, you need to constantly monitor your opponents' screens to find them, turning what would otherwise be a quirky but unremarkable shooter into something absorbingly tense."", ""Regardless of whether you're playing online or with friends in the same room, Screencheat splits the screen into two, three, or four fields of view, and then sets you loose to try and find each other. That's easier than it sounds, because Screencheat's five arenas are all split into color-coded areas, with lots of unique features (including shortcuts and jump pads) that make them a blast to explore, while also making it easy to tell at a glance where your opponents are. It's relatively unchallenging fun with two players, but can quickly turn mind-boggling with three or four. It's tempting to let your attention settle on one enemy, but that's dangerous, as it might let the other two run past you undetected  or worse, get the drop on you and send your randomized, suddenly visible avatar ragdolling to the ground."", 'It\'s all in fun, though; a feeling reinforced by Screencheat\'s silly kill messages (in an average match, you can expect to be ""unfollowed,"" ""enveloped,"" and ""Obama\'d"") and its bizarre eight-weapon arsenal. Ranging from a shotgun-like blunderbuss to a plasma cannon to a charging hobby horse to an aimlessly hopping teddy-bear bomb, each implement of death has a different degree of usefulness that might not be clear at first. The crossbow, for example, initially felt like a slow-to-reload beast that demanded pinpoint precision  until I realized it was shooting out a tether that, for a few seconds, let me clothesline any opponents it touched. And while the candelabra only works at close range, it swings in wide arcs, making it easy to clock anyone who wanders into striking distance. Be warned, though  while you may be invisible, your weapon\'s visual effects aren\'t, which means that giant fireball you\'re charging up will paint a big target on you for other players.', 'Discoverable strategies notwithstanding, Screencheat keeps its action light and its pace fast. Its bite-sized matches rarely last longer than a few minutes (if that), and its best modes are simple, familiar classics: deathmatch, king of the hill (or ""Hillcampers""), and Capture the Fun, which replaces the usual flag with a confetti-spraying (and therefore visible) pinata. Meanwhile, One Shot  which prevents reloading until either everyone has fired, or a constantly looping 15-second timer has counted down  is interesting but not all that enjoyable, and Murder Mystery (which assigns each player a target that must be killed with a specific weapon) sounds great on paper, but quickly turns tedious in practice.', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', ""Actually, that's true of any of the modes, given enough time. Screencheat is best played in short sessions; having to keep track of multiple screens gets exhausting after a while, and once you know what you're doing, you can experience everything Screencheat has to offer in around 20 minutes. However, if you can get a few friends together in front of your PC (and your PC in front of a couch), it's much more rewarding. This is the sort of game that's best enjoyed with trash talk, temporary alliances, and elbowed controllers, which have the added benefit of making Screencheat's occasional but annoying bugs, and overall unpolished feel, less noticeable.""]",IGN

The story is nothing more than an excuse to go out and kill stuff, and the gameplay is just as unforgiving as humanitys struggle for survival in a world where other races and species are vying for dominance. Natural Doctrine tries to challenge even the most elite tactical RPG veterans, but it ends up being infuriatingly unfair - filling its 40-hour campaign with rage-inducing battles.', 'Perhaps Natural Doctrines greatest failing is in how it struggles to convey its needlessly complex combat system (and no, the quick tutorial and walls of text that teach you how to play arent much help). During a turn, every unit has the ability to have other allies go immediately after them through Link Turns. The criteria for linking attacks is as convoluted as the user interface; after somehow managing to link my entire team into one huge attack, my screen is a comical mess of lines, colors, and even upside-down scrolling text. Its an aggravating and unbalanced system that favors strength in numbers. The problem is that I was almost always outnumbered, meaning when it was the enemys turn, they relentlessly assaulted me, leading to constant deaths. On the rare occasion my team was larger (this only happened during a few boss fights), the enemy inexplicably got Quick Turns, allowing them to constantly skip turn order and go first, making the fights even more one-sided than they already were.', 'Worst of all is the fact that theres no saving during the often long and grueling battles. Checkpoints are sparse, so the often unavoidable losses I suffered stung that much worse. During one fight, I had to defeat a small army while keeping the enemys leader alive. I spent 45 minutes defending my team while chipping away at the opponents health with my snipers only for the leader to rush in, auto-triggering my riflemens covering fire ability. I watched in horror as my stupid teammates unwittingly killed the one person they were tasked to keep alive, effectively erasing nearly an hours worth of progress.', 'In another lengthy fight against a dozen dragons, I had the help of an AI-controlled goblin wizard. He decided to use a fireball on one of them, catching my characters in the crossfire. Twenty minutes of progress were deleted thanks to friendly fire outside my control. Natural Doctrine constantly worked against meeven when it was on my side.', 'Even on the easiest difficulty, a characters death means an instant game over and thanks to constant occurrences like the ones described above, my characters died a lot. By the end of the game, my team was so big that I was managing ten separate health bars at once, constantly worrying that one would get hit by a critical attack for an instant loss, which happened far too often.  Its as if Natural Doctrine expected me to know every move my opponents would makeeven implausible oneswhich meant my victories werent based on tactics or strategy but constant trial and error, and dumb luck.', 'Fortunately, the game allows you to respec skills at any point at no cost, but no amount of skill swapping could change how poorly magic is handled. Instead of the traditional mana, humans use grams of Pluton, a fictional element, to cast spells. The issue is that its a finite resource, and getting more of it is hard. Pluton is found in chests in the dungeons and caves you explore, but opening them during battle is suicide because it wastes a full turn. By the final levels, I was so low on Pluton that my mages were literally worthless wastes of turns I was forced to keep alive.', 'Multiplayer Screenshot', 'Multiplayer Screenshot', 'Multiplayer Screenshot', 'Multiplayer Screenshot', 'Multiplayer Screenshot', 'Advertisement', 'Multiplayer Screenshot', 'Multiplayer Screenshot', 'Multiplayer Screenshot', 'Multiplayer Screenshot', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'To make matters worse, Natural Doctrine is punctuated by a forgettable story, unlikeable characters, and nonsensical dialogue.

The voice acting is about as annoying as youd expect 12-year-olds in pink armor to be. I almost lost my mind after hearing Tatyana shout her catchphrase Dinner is served! for the fiftieth time.

This wickedly creative, tense, and yes, tough game does not suffer fools gladly, yet I was compelled to return to it after the screen bled to red every time. That, I believe, is the definition of a great survival horror experience.', 'The Evil Within is aesthetically, functionally, and spiritually in step with director Shinji Mikamis last foray into the genre, the iconic Resident Evil 4. Its not simply a rehash of that game, though, as Mikami and his new development studio Tango Gameworks have delivered a harder, bleaker game this time around.', 'Not that the plot is a strikingly original work for the horror genre. The Evil Within is an investigation of what appears to be a multiple homicide at Beacon Mental Hospital in its fictional Krimson City, before you realize things are not as they seem (an understatement). While its central mystery starts off as compelling, it gradually veers off course, and eventually buckles under the weight of its own unfocused ambition. I found its ending in particular, complete with an unnecessary boss battle apparently inserted only to serve the story, disappointing.', 'In part, this narrative wrapper is undermined by the rather lifeless player character, Detective Sebastian Castellanos, who is emotionless and cool to the point of parody. Sebastian still quips mundanities like what is going on here? after hours of facing the kind of monsters that would drive the average person into a jabbering wreck. Its hard to care about the stakes when it appears that he doesnt, even if his calm detachment - I must be losing it! - is on occasion darkly comic.', 'While far from subtle - this is about as excessive as a horror game gets - Tango has created some incredibly strange and wonderful places in The Evil Withins 15 chapters. Even the usual horror cliches have been twisted and contorted in imaginative ways; meat lockers, clanging industrial interiors, and mannequins have been granted new and ghastly life.', 'Zooming in, these places are small and linear level designs, yet with the aid of excellent lighting, they become claustrophobic and labyrinthian. Despite a little roughness around the edges  - I noticed texture pop-up and clipping issues in the PS4 and Xbox One versions  - the game has been beautifully designed.', 'Tango has employed a keen eye for composition in The Evil Within, and interiors are grimy, full of looming shadows, ornate architecture, and ominous escape routes. They create a terrifying mood of expectation. Once or twice I found myself ducking to avoid an attacker that was revealed to be my own (harmless) shadow, or running from an unseen enemy only to realize nobody was chasing me bar the groans of some distant foe.', 'Otherwise, the threat here is very real. Enemies that pepper these places are plentiful, unpredictable, and smart. Initially evoking Resident Evil 4s shambling ganados, they get weirder as The Evil WIthin progresses; not quite The Infected, more The Perverted; designed with an eye toward childhood nightmares and heavily inspired by Japanese horror movies. I wouldnt be surprised to see some of these foes - in particular, the unforgettable Keeper boss - come to define The Evil Within as time moves on, cosplayed for years and endlessly re-imagined in fan art.', 'It is The Evil Withins most unnerving juxtaposition that combat with these terrors is so grounded in reality. You are given only a modest but well-balanced arsenal - the usual pistol, shotgun, sniper rifle, grenade and crossbow combo - with which to fight, as well as basic melee. And while the crossbow caters to a variety of special attacks (freeze, electrocute, harpoon, etc) and shooting is as satisfyingly crunchy as you would expect from Mikami, you have little ammo, first aid, or even stamina at your disposal. Cruelly, for a game where I spent a lot of time running away, Sebastian runs out of puff very quickly. Checkpoints are scarce, so the stakes in this hostile world are high, making for exhilarating experiences regardless of whether you decide to flee or fight as these creatures run - screaming - towards you.', 'The Evil Within does cater somewhat to those who wish to choose the stealth route, although the AI feels unfairly tuned in on you. You can lay traps or distract enemies by throwing bottles and sneak up behind them for a stealth kill, but more often than not theyll turn around at the last second, or will have already spotted you several seconds ago. Playing stealthily works in fits and starts, but I did not find it the most accessible gameplay style to adopt.', 'Of course, youre not completely powerless. One of The Evil Withins most enjoyable mechanics is its simple upgrade system. Green gel is the limited resource that you use to improve your abilities, weapons, stock and crossbow bolts while in safe houses, and its dispersed throughout the world like hidden gold, becoming your most sought after resource.  While cashing in this gel makes for strong dilemmas of choice - do you upgrade your shotgun damage, or do you want to be able to run for longer? - I liked how it let me shape my own gameplay style and gave me a brief, if generally illusory, sense of control of the situation.', ""Such pockets of calm are welcome because it's chaos, not control, that is the point of The Evil Within. The pacing of the action and horror propels you forward at breakneck speed, moving from one climactic encounter to the next with little to no reprieve. Throughout my playthrough, I always felt on the backfoot, and the times when I was really on the backfoot - Im talking six in the sniper rifle chamber facing a close-combat boss, here - produced some of the most incredible moments Ive experienced in any video game for years. It had me sweaty-palmed, heart in my throat, for most of its duration."", '', '', 'PC Version - October 16, 2014', ""The PC port of The Evil Within plays much the same as the console versions, and as such is locked into a cinematic 2:35:1 aspect ratio. That's a bit of an issue - I played on a small 22-inch monitor, and the thick black letterbox bars at the top and bottom of the screen eventually did impede my enjoyment of The Evil Within by simply not allowing me to see enough of it. This was a problem I did not experience at all playing on my 40-inch TV screen, and it's something to take into consideration when deciding which version to pick up, depending on your home set-up."", 'Another thing to be aware of is that The Evil Within on PC is locked at 30fps by default. Video options in the menu are slim, but you can change this to 60fps via (unsupported) debug console commands. Running at the latter framerate, I did notice stuttering when moving the camera around swiftly from left to right  not ideal when in the midst of a breathless firefight. All things considered, I preferred it at a steady 30fps.', '', 'The video options in The Evil Within are slim.', 'One other little criticism: the mouse controls in the menu screen lag significantly, although performed fine for me in-game.', 'Ultimately, the experience I had on PC is pretty much the same as youll get playing on console, which might disappointment high-end PC users. Although I experienced no crashes while running it on an Intel Core i7-3770 CPU and Nvidia GeForce GTX680, thats about as high as my praise goes for this port on a technical level.']",IGN
162,Legend of Grimrock II,17-Oct-14,Leif Johnson,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/17/the-legend-of-grimrock-ii-review,"[""It wasn't the leprechaun who lured my party to their deaths in a spiky trap that made me realize I loved The Legend of Grimrock 2; it wasn't even the bog monster who yanked our weapons from our hands, forcing us to punch it to death to get them back. Grimrock 2s excellent lasting impression instead came from the way it alternates its clever tricks and unpredictable combat with demanding puzzles that recall the heyday of Myst. Even more so than its 2012 predecessor, its achieved a synthesis of two favorite styles from the early '90s that holds up well today."", ""Despite what the title might lead you to believe, Grimrock 2s story isn't exactly the stuff of legend. You and three companions shipwreck on the island of Nex and slaughter the menagerie of monsters who call it home, all the while trying to find out who keeps leaving you smug little letters on stone altars and in rotting crates. Gilgamesh this is not."", ""It's perhaps better appreciated as a lightweight metaphor for Grimrock 2s stylistic shift: the four warriors break out of the boxy cage that confined them on the shore in the opening scene and step into the open air and beauty of the island of Nex, immediately contrasting against the first, entirely underground game. It was a liberating moment, both for my characters and for me. This is the series moving out into the world and finding itself, although it wisely continues the tradition of letting us discover its rules for ourselves rather than force-feeding them with tutorials."", ""It's a wobbly transition at first, true, not least because developer Almost Human chose to stick with a rigidly grid-based, four-direction movement system. It feels slightly out of place in these handsome surroundings, which seem like theyd be better paired with a free-roaming movement system. Even having played the original Grimrock two years ago, learning to move this way again felt a little like finding my land legs after a long voyage  holding down A or D for too long sometimes found me careening into traps I might otherwise have avoided. But much as in this year's drabber Might & Magic X: Legacy, it's not an insurmountable transition, and finding your feet reveals a land crammed with forests, beaches, and yes, even several old-style dungeons."", ""Such visual diversity extends to the adventurers themselves. There's a satisfying crop of character portraits to choose from this time around, for one, and the new ratling race makes a good addition to Grimrock's decidedly non-standard race roster of insectoids, lizardman, minotaurs, and the like. I found the new ratling race particularly useful, both for its helpful innate immunity to Grimrock 2's many diseases and because his penchant for hoarding meant he could carry more than his companions."", '', '', '', '', '', ""Grimrock 2 further shakes up the expectations of traditional fantasy with its new Farmer class, who earns his XP not by swatting wolves or mushroom creatures but rather by munching on food. That's rarely a problem, though; keep the munching coming, and the adventuresome aggie hacks and slashes as well as the more predictable barbarians and knights. As before, the hacking and slashing itself takes place in real time, in stark contrast to the turn-based combat other recent dungeon crawlers created in the vein of 1991's Eye of the Beholder. The shift allows Grimrock 2 to maintain an energetic pace. More than that, it allows strategies for evasion unheard of in battles from 20 years ago that hinged on merely watching if your blows hit or missed. That was true in the 2012 original as well, but the enemies are smarter and faster now, such as the leprechaun (my arch nemesis!) who danced about the screen and made landing hits an ordeal, even with the (admittedly weak) new guns that add to Grimrock 2's ranged arsenal. Fewer, too, are the lazy strafe-and-smack battles that made some of the biggest fights in the first Grimrock such a joke."", 'But Grimrock 2 has little patience for fighters who\'d rather just smash their way through life. If you want to make it through this school of hard knocks (and occasional sword slashes), you\'ll have to fancy yourself a bit of a scholar as well. Puzzles seem as common as enemies here, and their solutions are sometimes harder than the stones on Nex. Some are as simple as placing the items in your inventory on pressure tiles in the shape of an ""X"" (as hinted by a nearby runestone reading ""X marks the spot""), while others involve gadgetry, such as teleports, for skillful executions. Other elements, such as two large weights suspended by chains in a tunnel, seem to exist only only to fool you into thinking they\'re attached to a puzzle. Sometimes, I guess, a weight is just a weight.', ""One issue is that the wide-open world means that the solutions to puzzles aren't always as readily available as they were in the dungeons of 2012. All too often, the hunt for the metaphorical key led me to wander off to unexplored areas for clues that might get me past the latest roadblock. The design prodded me to explore, yes, and it's true that clues for almost every puzzle I encountered waited somewhere out in the world. It's just a question of where. In Grimrock 2's weakest moments, this uncertainty resulted in discouraging downtimes as I blindly searched for help. I once jaunted off for hours just to search for a clue to one of the many puzzles that stumped me, only to find that the hint had been nearby the entire time. After that, doubt gnawed at me on all future forays into the wild."", ""And so it was with Myst, back in 1991. Much as in that series, Grimrock 2's puzzles sometimes reached such a pitch of frustration that I wanted to bang my head against the dungeons walls, or at the very least, solicit external help. (I never did.) The payoff, of course, is that figuring out individual tough solutions on my own was as rewarding as completing entire games in different genres. Grimrock II kept me coming back simply for the fun of it all.  Even now, after around 20 hours of mucking around Nex, I still feel as though I've not seen huge swaths of the secrets hiding in the trees."", ""But many more adventures  and arguably better ones  could await us in the future. The Legend of Grimrock 2 comes with its own dungeon editor for those wishing to create worlds aside from Nex, and it's simple enough that I figured out the basics within seconds. Using a bird's-eye-view map as a guide, I pulled assets such as castle gates, broken colossal statues, angry wargs, and a dusky sky and cobbled them together into the setting of a ruined temple on the edge of a forest. Within five minutes, I'd made a world I wanted to visit, and I marvel to think I what others could accomplish with the tool if they give it some serious thought. The built-in dungeon browser's currently empty, unfortunately, but I'm hoping that will change as more players finish the campaign in the coming days.""]",IGN
163,Lords of the Fallen,27-Oct-14,Leif Johnson,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/27/lords-of-the-fallen-review,"[""Forty-five minutes passed in Lords of the Fallen before I died for the first time. That's a bit of a surprise for a game that makes no secret of its heavy debts to the ultra-punishing Dark Souls series, but the combat I experienced on the way to that first death revealed a game that's just as concerned with letting us have fun without the pain. At times it sacrifices too much at the altar of combat accessibility, but it usually makes up for it with a tempting risk-reward system that caters to multiple play styles, and through the arcadey pleasures of hacking and slashing for loot."", ""Lords of the Fallens formulaic story follows Harkyn, a gruff criminal who's pulled from behind bars to save the world from interdimensional monsters called the Rhogar. Were never told the nature of his crimes, however, and Lords repeatedly introduces other characters with only a modicum of characterization. Even the big bad guy behind it all gets only around three minutes of screen time. When the plot tries for a shocking twist near the end of its roughly 17-hour story, it's hard to care about anyone involved."", ""The story wants to be something greater, but never quite attains it. It peppers its cutscenes with choices such as whether to chop a monk's infected arm off or leave it to fester, but significance feels minimal aside from alterations to the final scene after the last boss falls over. Far more interesting are the audio snippets of lore waiting in scrolls scattered about the world of Keystone, which help Harkyn's world come to life in a way it never manages with the main cast of characters in play."", 'It\'s generally a good looking world, although aside from the welcome lengthy jaunt into the Rhogar homeworld, its composed of the usual crumbling castles and snowy peaks. (I like to think that it would have been more interesting had the Rhogar world featured something else besides, well, more crumbling castles and snowy peak.) All in all, I was more fascinated by the look of the gear than the landscape; the bulky, comic book design of characters and weaponry is less ""prepare to die"" and more lets kick some ass.', ""As it turns out, that attitude doesnt undermine the joys of combat. Blocking attacks and rolling out of harm's way is essential in Lords of the Fallen, at least for the first few hours. Harkyn also encounters some fascinating creatures along the way, such as vaguely Cthulhu-type figures who breathe fire or giant spiders who spew venom. They're certainly not pushovers, but neither are they even close in difficulty to the monsters Dark Souls fans are used to. In fact, on the mandatory first playthrough before the New Game Plus is enabled, encounters seem balanced for people who were scared away from Dark Souls unrelenting emphasis on hardcore play."", ""Lords of the Fallen concerns itself more with arcade-quality fun, and it complements this focus with a Diablo-style loot system that drops ever-better weapons and gear from both chests and enemies. The weapons themselves are fun to use, whether it's a customizable magic gauntlet for ranged combat or impressive-looking weapons like scythes and staves. It rewards you at almost every turn, whether it's with chests crammed with entire gear sets or with the hidden challenge portals that pop up after you defeat a boss, allowing you to fight off three waves of enemies for the promise of a chest crammed with loot."", ""Getting into the sword-swing of things reveals a fun hack-and-slash combat experience that feels closer to the beat-em-up style of Darksiders than Dark Souls' high-stakes deuling. You can charge up attacks for more force, for instance, and you can minimize the energy needed to swing Harkyn's hefty weapons through carefully timed combos. You're locked into one of three sets of four spells for warrior, rogue, or cleric playstyles for the first playthrough, but I did feel I had a fair amount of freedom to play Harkyn as I chose. The biggest issue is that the class skills are wildly overpowered when fully upgraded."", ""I played as a Warrior, and early on I picked up a Rage spell that boosted my damage and briefly removed the need for energy/stamina requirements, thus trivializing fights that previously forced me to conserve my energy for shield blocks. Yet another spell sends the ghost of a warrior rushing toward a foe, staggering them and allowing me to score hits against even heavily shielded enemies. Yet the greatest of these is Quake, which summons a massive spirit who smites my enemy with a mighty thud of the hammer. Maxxed out and complemented with high magic, it makes even the toughest bosses a joke. Once you've completed the game with one class's spells, you can unlock one of the two additional ones or New Game+. In my case, having beat the game as a Warrior, I'm fleshing out the Rogue spell tree for my second playthrough. By the time I have all three unlocked at once for the third playthrough, Harkyn should be ready to take over as the world's god."", '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', 'Advertisement', 'At the same time, Lords of the Fallen tries to increase its challenge in indirect ways. Just like Dark Souls, it makes you return to the scene of your death to recover lost XP, for instance, but it ups the ante by attaching a timer to the XP pile. Take too long to fight your way back, and it disappears forever. Glowing gems that serve as checkpoints and potion-filling stations allow you to play it safe by storing XP in them for use with either magic or attributes, or you can be more ambitious and ignore them to build up an XP multiplier that increases with each kill. It even discourages grinding by not triggering enemy respawns after you reach a checkpoint; they only pop up again after you die. This risk-reward system is the great idea behind Lords of the Fallen.', ""It's a good system, particularly since there's no way to adjust the difficulty, so it's sad to watch Lords of The Fallen make it irrelevant in the second half of the campaign by allowing you to reach quasi-godhood with little effort. The class spells had already minimized most of the challenge, but looted runes that bestow stats such as extra attack power or defense make humiliating enemies even simpler once you slot it into your gear. And that's not the end of it. If you're willing to bet some of your XP at the resident rune crafter, you have a good chance of receiving an even more powerful version."", ""This balance issue carries over to the bosses. Lords of the Fallen boasts a couple of battles that forced me to think out strategies for victory, but I managed to kill four other bosses on the first try by simply wailing on them with a big sword and my warrior's Quake spell while blocking and swigging a potion when needed. That's not to say it wasn't fun, but dying at the hands of a boss on the first try became a mere annoyance rather than the first step in a rewarding learning experience. Halfway through the campaign, I absolutely expected to win every fight as long as I played within my comfort zone, and that's a problem."", ""Heavy armor pushes this drive toward absolute power to absurd lengths. In time, my Harkyn seemed to laugh off heavy blows even without the extra help from spells. The challenges do grow consistently tougher and more satisfying once you complete a playthrough and venture into New Game Plus territory, but it's a shame you have to wait.""]",IGN
164,Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth,23-Oct-14,Dan Stapleton,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/23/civilization-beyond-earth-review,"['Because its based on the outstanding turn-based strategy mechanics of Civilization V, Civilization: Beyond Earth starts from a position of greatness. Even on these barely recognizable alien worlds, the addictiveness of building cities, exploration, and tactical combat holds up well. From there, developer Firaxis runs a series of bold experiments with Civilizations established design. A few  such as the new Affinities system and streamlined unit upgrading  bear promising results, but cumulatively, enough of them go awry that I have to label Beyond Earth as my least-favorite Civilization in more than a decade. Of course, given the sky-high bar set by the series, its still a strong 4X game.', 'A game of Beyond Earth begins with your spaceship landing and founding a colony, equipped with a minor starting bonus of your choosing that smartly removes the first few turns of tapping next until you build that first worker or soldier or basic building and allows you to get to the next decision. The eight all-human faction choices, based on hypothetical future-Earth alliances like the Pan-Asian Cooperative and the Slavic Federation, are unexciting; each has a small bonus to espionage or city growth or what have you, and you get to select from an extra menu of similar bonuses to layer on top of the cultural one (such as additional cash or culture generation), so theres some decent customization there. However, none of them has the recognition or implied personality of other Civ games historical leaders, and none have any memorable traits of their own. Faction design is basically what were accustomed to from Civ 5, with the notable absence of faction-specific military or trade units.', 'Finding my footing in Beyond Earth was tougher than its been in most Civs because, like most sci-fi games, its so alien and unfamiliar. The map is pretty to look at (especially with the subtle depth of field effect that softly defocuses the edges of the screen) but tough to read at a glance, because terrain and improvements look nothing like those on Earth. Domes and futuristic machinery dont communicate function like a farm or windmill does. Likewise, the non-linear tech web is a strong idea on paper, because it forces you to make tough calls about which techs youll pursue and which youll forego completely. In practice, at least for the first several games, its confusing  who knows the difference between Alien Sciences and Fabrication unless you read up extensively on both? And when you have a dozen different research options open at any given time, its overwhelming. The only thing that saves it from totally bogging down is the search function, which lets you highlight the techs that will give you access to the kind of structures and units you need. Its the kind of thing that Im sure will get easier once Ive memorized my desired research paths.', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'The next challenge youll face is the swarms of free-roaming alien insects and sea monsters, which pose a problem for the usual early-game Civ tasks of taming the wilderness, exploration, and establishing trade. These creatures may look more interesting than cave men with clubs, and theyre made of tougher stuff - especially these Dune-style siege worms - but theyre frustratingly unpredictable and cant be negotiated with. At least with barbarians I knew where I stood: they wanted to kill me, so I should kill them first. These aliens seem to strike at random, ignoring my units for the most part, then abruptly picking off trade convoys and taking pot shots at my soldiers without provocation.', 'Given Firaxis history with making powerful, multi-faceted indigenous populations in Sid Meiers Colonization, Id expected these aliens to have a purpose beyond impairing your early expansion, and maybe even have a role to play in the mid and late game as allies if I chose to respect their right to exist. Strangely, there is none. After 150 or so turns, my technology advanced to the point where the aliens were no longer a threat, and they simply occupied space Id rather have my stuff on. Even the technologies that allow you to build your own alien units dont require you to keep the natural-born ones around, so there are few reasons not to wipe them out. They feel pointless.', 'Wiping them out is a good time, at least. Battle is basically the same great tactics-focused one-unit-per tile system from Civ 5  and the AI knows how to use it reasonably well, too. Things are moved along quickly because Beyond Earths military units benefit from an instant and free upgrade system that triggers when you upgrade technology, eliminating a lot of the annoying micromanagement of obsolete units. Individual upgrades like Civ 5s situational bonuses are deemphasized, but I like how every time you earn an upgrade for a unit type you get to pick between two possible bonuses, such as better attack or faster movement. That allows you to tailor your units to the type of war you want to wage.', 'Upgrades are triggered by the unlocking of Affinity points in three categories, mostly via technological advancement. These are another of Beyond Earths best ideas. Focusing on developing the Harmony Affinity, for example, gives your units strengths like immunity to (and eventually gain healing from) the hazardous miasma gas that pollutes the land, while Purity can boost combat and Supremacy aids you economically. The Affinity you concentrate on also determines which powerful unique units you unlock, like infantry mounted on aliens and levitating tanks, and eventually some great super-sized ones like the gigantic Xeno Titan. The choice is reflected visually in your cities through distinctive red, yellow, or green and curvy designs for the buildings, differentiating you from your different-minded neighbors. I do miss faction-specific units, but this meld of technology and religion has some interesting effects on both combat and diplomacy, since colonies prefer others that share their Affinity.', 'Speaking of diplomacy, Beyond Earth introduces the concept of favors, where a colony with nothing you want at the moment will let you bank IOUs in exchange for trade goods. Its something Civs negotiating table has sorely needed. Other than that, though, diplomacy isnt highly developed; in fact, Ive communicated with my neighbors less than usual, probably due to the lack of luxury resources to trade and the buffer of aliens between us that keeps their troops from wandering into my turf.', 'The other notable new feature is the satellite layer, which allows you to temporarily orbit a support unit above the map. It sounds cooler than it is in reality, because the reality of it is that these satellites are actually just area buffs that temporarily boost the production of certain resources on the land below. One exception to that rule is the orbital laser, which is great for bombardment, and theres some strategy to be had in protecting yourself from enemy lasers by distributing your own satellites, since they cant overlap. On the whole, though, theyre not that exciting.', 'When it comes to deciding who rules your planet, there are technically five victory options, but effectively only three available to you at any one time: one for each of the three Affinities, a research-based option for contacting intelligent life, and good old-fashioned military victory. The Affinity-based options each have their own goal scenario that calls back to past Civ games space victory, where you must first build a structure on the map and then complete an additional task  charging it up, loading units into it, or settling Earth colonists that emerge from it  while defending it from attack. Its great to be able to militarily interfere with another factions victory plan without actually conquering their cities. However, trying to finish one of these when no one is willing or able to stop you is a huge, slow-paced chore that doesnt do the notoriously laborious Civ endgame any favors. The military and science victories are more practical goals.', 'Whats strange, and unusual for a Civilization game, is that ending a game is frustratingly abrupt. For the first time I can remember, there is no after-action report recapping your colonys story whatsoever. Youre just dumped back to the main menu for another go. I once lost a game by one turn, and I wasnt even told who beat me or how theyd done it until I went back and reloaded from an autosave for a super-slow instant replay. Thats weird and disappointing, because I love recounting my epic journey in other Civ games.']",IGN

To the contrary, Costume Quest 2 is an even tastier morsel than the original Costume Quest, and serves up an even bigger bag of accessible humor and combat. There are a few sour patches within this fun-sized roleplaying game, especially when it comes to the flawed healing system, but as a whole, it's a tiny treat."", ""Costume Quest 2's combat as a whole deserves commendation; it's not quite at the level of epics like Persona 4, but its deep enough that the turn-based battles never got repetitive over this five to six-hour campaign like they did in the original. Between the ability to add a second attack if the first is timed right, and the option to charge a block for one character and turn it into a counter (trading off that you might not react in time if the enemy attacks one of the other two) it gave me something to think about."", 'The buff system, now implemented via ""Creepy Treat Cards,"" offers a bit more freedom than Costume Quest\'s Battle Stamps. While the original required you attach a single attribute to each character with only 24 modifiers to play with, there\'s 45 different Creepy Treat Cards which can be used by any character at any time in battle with a three-to-five battle cooldown period. Most importantly, Creepy Treat Cards aren\'t mandatory like Battle Stamps, so you can forgo them for extra challenge. There\'s a far bigger challenge in the form of the inanimate HP-sponge Candy Corn costume that trades a third of your attack options in each battle for a clever quip about the Halloween staple and if you\'re playing on a non-Nintendo platform, a hard-earned Achievement/Trophy at the end of your quest.', 'Unfortunately the difficulty balance is thrown off a bit due to the awkward healing system. In my review of the PC version of Costume Quest 2 (now patched to match the console version) I found it had a pretty serious issue that forced you to regularly re backtracking to one of the scattered water fountains. Thats fixed now, by an option to heal an entire party for a nominal fee of the ""Candy"" currency. While it\'s certainly better, this solution is like a Band-Aid on an ax wound. Healing classes and items are unimportant vestiges of a system that no longer exists (especially the Creepy Treat Cards that heal allies after battles), and healing is so cheap it might as well be free, removing almost all consequences of taking damage and any resource management for healing. While an overly simple healing system is better than a tedious one, theres got to be a better middle ground.', ""Another issue that interferes with the fun is navigation, as making your way through Costume Quest 2's world is far more difficult than you'd expect from a game that appears so accessible. You can buy a map thatll reveal a new area, but you still have to figure out where you are on that map, because it doesnt use any kind of location marker to tell you. While that's not an issue with some of the more wide-open areas at the beginning of the campaign, more than one of the future-set stages included far more twists and turns than the map could detail, due in part to Costume Quest 2's insistence on drawing maps in the style of crude childrens drawings."", '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', ""Yet Costume Quest 2 won me over with the colorful locales and endearing characters that popped up during Reynold and Wren's second quest to save Halloween. The time travel and resulting dystopian locations like an oppressive school and a Metropolis-style slum, are great, even if the objectives haven't evolved much beyond the knocking on doors and getting tricks or treats we did in the original."", 'I did miss a few the charming moments because of Costume Quest 2\' s itchy trigger finger. On more than one occasion each, I accidentally skipped a cutscene (that could not be replayed due to autosaving) with a single wayward button tap, or accepted loss in a battle by mistakenly scrolling over to the ""run away"" option. A simple ""are you sure?"" prompt in each situation would have done wonders.', 'The main villain is a sugar-hating dentist who actually has personality; a big improvement over the originals forgettable candy-stealing monsters. The time traveling also allows you to see multiple forms of the same NPCs, which helps to even make the most common-seeming bystander a bit more memorable. That, and constant references back to old Double Fine games and Earthbound, which is one of the biggest influences for Costume Quest, make Costume Quest 2 a cute and lighthearted seasonal RPG despite a few dips in the action due to a quirky health system and maddening map navigation.', ""Costume Quest 2 is now virtually everywhere, and for this review I played on Xbox One, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, and Wii U. Its interesting that, for a game with such basic character models (outside of battle, at least), the visual differences between console generations are striking. On PlayStation 4 and Xbox One there's a noticeable upgrade in framerate, as well as ambient environmental effects like shadow-casting streetlights and reflections in the various bodies of water. On the bright side, the lower-end performance on 360, PS3, and Wii U never interfered with combat timing or my overall enjoyment."", ""Costume Quest 2 on Wii U fails to take any advantage of the GamePad, as the second screen is only used to show the same art that pops up in every version's loading screen.

This 20th Anniversary Edition is a straight remake, not a reimagining or reinvention of the first game. While the art has received a 3D-ish makeover to support todays higher resolutions and wider screens, its a nearly perfect reproduction that replicates the gameplay, puzzles, dialogue, and atmosphere of its ancestor in all its glory.', 'That said, it helps to remember that this Gabriel Knight, like the first one, is set in 1993, and that the plot - in which Gabriel investigates a murderous Voodoo Cult in New Orleans - pre-dates gorier, more sophisticated fare like The Walking Dead. Its a bit like opening a time capsule; for example, Gabriel doesnt carry a cellphone, gets daily updates from a print newspaper, and unashamedly tosses out sexist come-ons to female characters that would make Duke Nukem blush. Some of the tone-setting dialogue that served to overcome the originals visual shortcomings now come off as over the top and sometimes even silly. (The evolution of Gabriels relationship with socialite Malia Gedde now seems particularly sudden and overwrought.)', 'One of my personal misgivings about the remake was that the original voice casts performances were unsalvageable, meaning that Tim Curry (The Rocky Horror Picture Shows Dr. Frankenfurter) doesnt reprise his role as Gabriel Knight. Though the British actor was ridiculously miscast as a Cajun, his leering, guttural delivery turned out to be a guilty pleasure of virtual scene-chewing. Im happy to report that the new Gabriel tackles the role with the same zeal, growling each line with winking gusto. In fact, the entire cast does a stellar job in recreating the vocal performances of the original. The soundtrack has been similarly remastered to good effect, though some selections seem totally out of place. For example, I really couldve done without the inappropriately jaunty march (complete with whistles) that plays in the police station while Gabriel is discussing mutilated corpses with his cop pal, Mosely.', 'The gameplay and puzzles remain as challenging and head-scratching as ever, though. Only a handful of new mind-benders have been added to the remake, so if you remember how to defeat the deadly python attack in the original, youll be able to do it again now. If you dont, a very handy hint system is available to help jog your memory... or eventually give you the answer outright. The mouse-driven interface remains easy and intuitive to navigate, allowing you to look at, talk to, investigate, or interact with a person or object seamlessly. In some cases, what worked 20 years ago works just as well today.', 'The pacing of the story remains one of Gabriel Knights strengths, with new locations and items revealed as each day of the adventure passes. Often the resolution to a conundrum will be in plain sight, perfectly logical and easy to suss out if youve been paying attention. Its one of the reasons Gabriel Knight stands the test of time for adventure purists; theres little of that nonsensical adventure game logic to take you out of the experience.', '\n', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'One of the more enjoyable inclusions here is a treasure trove of background material from the making of both the first game and the remake, including comparisons of each location with how they appeared in the 1993 version, interviews with the original developers, and early concept art for the main characters. Its fun to see just how far adventure gaming has come in the last 20 years, and how visual and processing limitations affected Gabriel Knights design back in 1993.']",IGN
167,Disney Fantasia: Music Evolved,21-Oct-14,Miranda Sanchez,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/21/fantasia-music-evolved-review,"['Disneys Fantasia and Fantasia 2000 are magical films that give classical music new life through beautiful imagery; Fantasia: Music Evolved is a Kinect game that does just that, and more. Developer Harmonix borrows both classical and contemporary music, inserts them into Disney lore, and combines it all with unique gameplay in some beautiful realms to create a great new experience that reminded me of the fun a novel music game can inspire.', 'After playing a few easy but helpful introductory games, youll complete your apprenticeship under sorcerer Yen Sid and move on to beautifully designed and widely varied realms, such as a mystical forest and a space station, to play through songs and minigames to defeat a destructive force called The Noise. The story is enjoyable, though an unimportant side note as you unlock music for your song library, learn spells to customize songs, and uncover new realms.', 'Fantasia relies entirely on Kinect motion controls for navigation, gameplay, and everything in between, and in general it works really well. The movements feel similar to conducting, but the interactivity goes beyond simply keeping time with the music. Your sweeping, punching, holding, and path-following motions instead mimic rhythms and signal new musical phrases, which is a lot more fun than just counting a beat. Each motion is cued by an animation that bursts into a beautiful flurry of glitter if you hit them correctly; if you miss, the music will soften and you may lose your streak  but no matter how much you mess up, you cant fail the song. The closest you get to failure is not hitting a goal, which is, in a way, the same thing, yet its friendlier to young kids and people who just want to create music without judgment. The only problem I had with the controls was trying to grab something off in the distance. That can be a pain, especially in certain minigames.', 'Two other major actions can completely transform a song, and make Fantasias gameplay feel unique and personal in a way Ive never seen a music game try before. The first is a set of simple Composition spells, which allow you to create your own beat, rhythm, or phrase through gestures, then automatically integrate them into the song. Hearing something I created become a part of a song I love is a great feeling that borders on magical.', 'The other type, Remix cues, arent as personal, but offer another good option for customization between the different verses of a song. When hit correctly, the remix cue will increase your score multiplier and allow you pull in an element from one of two available remixes of each song. For example, you could opt to exchange the string line in Mussorgskys Night on Bald Mountain for a synthesizer, or the guitar and piano of Funs Some Nights for a horn line.', ""While it's great to create music on your own, working with a friend to create new elements for songs is even more enjoyable. Composition spells split recording time in half, so each player has a chance to add something to the song. The person in control of the Remix cue alternates, so its possible to have a wonky-sounding song if your partner chooses a radically different remix. This sounds like it could be a nuisance, but with the right partner its fun to collaborate to revamp the sound of the song."", 'Though youll work together during the creation parts, you are still competing against your partner for a higher score, which serves as a fun motive to hit more cues than your partner. My co-op partner originally agreed to playing one song with me, but that one song quickly turned into three as we got into it and the competition drove us forward. In a nice touch, Fantasia sidesteps the annoyance of unwrapping your copy to play with friends and finding most of the songs locked out with Party Mode. It suspends your ability to complete goals, but opens up all 33 songs on the playlist.']",IGN
168,Pokemon Trading Card Game Online,20-Oct-14,Kallie Plagge,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/20/pokemon-trading-card-game-online-review,"['Theres really not much to say about the free-to-play Pokemon Trading Card Game Online. Its the Pokemon Trading Card Game, but the way its been recreated for iOS is unremarkable, technically poor, and has very little going for it outside of its connection to the beloved franchise. Even though the PC-based version has been going for years, it still feels incomplete and hurried. As a life-long Pokemon fan and avid card collector, Im disappointed in its limited scope and across-the-board low quality, even as it allows me mobile access to a robust and engaging game I love.', 'The Pokemon TCGO looks and sounds strikingly amateurish. As far as the UI is concerned, I mightve mistaken it for a cheap knockoff  the cards have the official recognizable art, but the character art is in a distinctly different style than the typical Pokemon fare, and the juxtaposition is a little strange. The generic background music adds to that unofficial feeling. It feels like the same song is played on a loop, and it wore on my nerves more the longer I spent battling.', 'To its credit, I actually had fun playing the campaign, despite my first impressions with the UI. The relatively strong single-player mode is designed as both an opportunity to practice strategy and very gradually unlock more cards, and my gotta catch em all instinct definitely kicked in. Ive spent about 10 hours just replaying the NPCs in order to unlock more booster packs, and just like in the old days with binders and card-protecting sleeves, Ive also spent some time admiring my growing collection.', 'NPC difficulty isnt really consistent, even on the hardest setting, but  and this is true of the Pokemon TCG in general  its largely due to chance. I lost one match almost immediately because I drew too many unhelpful Trainer Cards, but I also had a particularly exciting match in which I defeated my opponents Kyurem by poisoning it and continually putting it to sleep with just a Wurmple. Thanks to a series of very lucky coin flips in my favor, Kyurem couldnt attack, and I stayed alive long enough to draw a better Pokemon.', 'The other major draw for PokemonTCGO, online competitive play, blows its potential with laggy matches that are altogether too slow-paced to enjoy. Multiple opponents took far too long choosing a Pokemon at the beginning, for example, so either there was a problem with the network communication or my adversaries had something better to do. Meanwhile, on my end, connecting to the network in general was finicky, and putting down the iPad for a minute to grab a snack or answer a text timed me out on multiple occasions.', 'As far as the free-to-play element goes, Pokemon TCGOs progression is paced a little slowly for those who opt out of microtransactions (and, in this case, buying packs of cards IRL that contain redeemable codes). Buying a full deck in the shop is 500 coins, and you earn anywhere from one to 10 per match. Its especially slow going if you want to play competitively with a deck you make yourself, as opposed to just using and reusing the starter decks. As someone with an already large collection of physical Pokemon cards, I have a hard time rationalizing buying more virtual ones for a mediocre online version of the game I already play in the real world.']",IGN
169,NBA Live 15,28-Oct-14,Mike Mitchell,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/28/nba-live-15-review,"['A good basketball coach will always drill into his team that the most important thing they can do is practice their fundamentals. Basics like dribbling, shooting, and moving around the court. Thats NBA Live 15s problem in a nutshell - no matter what minor additions and improvements it makes, it doesnt matter if it doesnt bring the feeling of controlling the moment-to-moment basketball up to standard.', 'Lets give NBA Live 15 credit where its due. This years game looks better in nearly every way compared to last years, particularly during close ups. The ESPN license, specifically the lengthy halftime report with Jalen Rose, adds a level of authenticity, even though Mike Breen and Jeff Van Gundys commentary is flatly delivered.', 'Animations are still stiff, though, and that causes big issues. While slightly improved from a year ago, the controls still feel clumsy and even unresponsive at times. And because the overall pace has been sped up, NBA Live 15 ends up feeling like NBA Jam, just without the fun of the Boom Shakalaka! arcadey movements and a realistic look just clash.', 'Light physics have been added this year, but only in particular cases, and only within the key. For instance, the players react to each other in a more natural way when fighting for a rebound or taking a charge, and it looks pretty realistic. But when an animated layup or dunk sequence is triggered, it pulls everyone into position in an unnatural way. It makes the outcome feel predetermined.', 'The best part of NBA Live 15s gameplay is working the pick & roll, which is extremely satisfying when pulled off. You simply hold L2 or Left Trigger to call a teammate to set a pick for you. Hell stay in that position as long as you hold the button, however this  is not always reliable. Based on the position of the defenders, and how the player youre controlling is behaving, an icon above the pick setters head will dynamically change, signifying what hes going to do next. Its a fantastic idea, and I really wish it worked consistently. But improvements like this give me hope that the Live franchise is, at least, headed in a positive direction.', 'Sadly, even when the pick is executed flawlessly, youre faced with another problem. Scoring points, the main objective in basketball, is counterintuitive in NBA Live 15. This new shot-quality indicator is added beneath your players feet, and its supposed to help you visualize when youre open and within range. But its too complicated to be useful in the heat of the moment, and seems like its not always accurate. I eventually got the timing down, once I figured out that the shot-release point seems abnormally quick, and its not close to the apex of the jump as youd expect. Meanwhile, layups and dunks are still way too easy to pull off, and too hard to stop when playing defense.', '\n', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', 'Advertisement', 'The game modes from a year ago all return, with a few minor improvements. Rising Star mode, a knockoff of NBA 2Ks MyCareer mode, is almost identical to last year, except there are more opportunities to improve your grade when playing within your role. But its still way easier to lose points than to gain points, and it felt like I was getting robbed. Playing as a slashing point guard, I found it nearly impossible to come off a screen and have the computer register my shot as an open jumper. Almost every time, even if I felt like I was wide open, I lost points for taking a so-called contested shot, even though the defender had his hands raised on the other side of the screen!', 'The one notable difference to Dynasty mode, the dull front-office managing Franchise mode, is the ability to jump into a simulated game at virtually any point. Thats kinda cool. Ultimate Team, the standard card collecting  game youve seen a dozen times, only adds an auction house, where you can buy or sell individual items. And Big Moments mode still promises to add important moments from the NBA season as they happen, like Damian Lillards game winning shot in the playoffs. The thing is, the moments dont feel as big as they should. After you complete the challenge, there are no congratulatory animations, or really anything at all. It just dumps you into a leaderboard.']",IGN
170,Watch Dogs: Bad Blood,10-Oct-14,Dan Stapleton,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/10/watch-dogs-bad-blood-review,"['As DLC typically goes, Watch Dogs: Bad Blood is a pretty substantial expansion. In whats becoming an Ubisoft tradition (like in Assassins Creed IV: Freedom Cry), it takes a side character and takes him on his own lengthy adventure  in this case, Raymond T-Bone Kenney. But whats interesting about it isnt the story, as thats fairly forgettable. The reason to play Bad Blood is the new Street Sweep missions, which bring out and highlight the freeform style of play that gives Watch Dogs its best moments.', 'Street Sweeps retool and reuse some of Watch Dogs existing open-world side missions as repeatable challenges that encourage stealth. They show me that someone at Ubisoft recognizes that Watch Dogs really works when it sends you into an open area with a goal, and leaves getting to it almost entirely up to you. These missions usually have secondary goals, like knocking out the target without being spotted, but theyre optional. Theres some freedom to get creative.', 'How quickly you get through the mission determines your rank on a leaderboard, giving bigger XP rewards for placing higher and unlocking a few unremarkable new weapons and skills. Im not sure how meaningful the leaderboard is as far as bragging rights, considering targets are often randomized and thus will sometimes be easier to take out than others, but its still pretty cool.', 'As for the campaign missions, theyre just okay. His filthy-looking dreadlocks and sense of remorse make him a somewhat more distinctive character than the bland Aiden Pierce, but T-Bone isnt a terribly likeable protagonist either. His banter with his neurotic sidekick, Tobias Frewer, got a bit annoying by the end of the five-hour story. And the ending of his conflict with another black-hat hacker (a returning character from the main campaign) does not make a ton of sense... but what can you expect from a game that revolves around magic hackers?', '', '', '', '', '', 'Level design in Bad Blood is a bit more puzzle-focused than standard Watch Dogs maps, with simple moving laser tripwire traps and occasional shifting walls taking the place of excessive use of hopping from camera to camera. Most of that was fairly unexciting - the stuff of uninspired platformers - but I do like how Watch Dogs flow-path hacking minigame is now often overlaid onto the world instead of against the blackness of a computer terminal. That cool touch made me feel more like I was hacking actual things.', ""The missions puzzle segments are broken up with unavoidable combat. Bad Blood brings in a few cool additions, like hackable security cameras wired to gun turrets, that make some of the wave-based combat sections feel unique to Watch Dogs. Theres also an RC car with an attached taser, but the ways its used in the campaign's puzzles arent terribly creative - its only good for going through vents that are specifically there to drive your RC car through. It's much more useful in the Street Sweep missions to knock out bad guys without being noticed."", ""Be advised that two of the three PCs I ran the latest version of Watch Dogs and Bad Blood on performed poorly, with significant hitching every few seconds especially while driving. It was nearly unplayable, even on a Core i7-990X with a GeForce GTX 780ti. However, the third PC  a Core i5-4670 and a GeForce GTX 780 performed well, easily hitting 60 frames per second on high settings. Since all three PCs have Nvidia GPUs and updated drivers, Im at a loss as to what causes this problem, unless it has a distaste for high-end Core i7 CPUs. However, because Watch Dogs did run fine on one of those PCs, I cant call it broken - I can only issue a warning that it may or may not have issues with your PC. If you're having trouble with Watch Dogs, Bad Blood probably won't be any better.""]",IGN
171,Alien: Isolation,3-Oct-14,Ryan McCaffrey,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/03/alien-isolation-review,"['Thanks to a slick opening that includes nostalgic narration and busted-tracking-on-the-VCR visual effects, the first five minutes of Alien: Isolation are far and away better than any piece of last years dreadfully disappointing Aliens: Colonial Marines. But by the end of the 15 to 20 (!) hours I spent with the mano-y-xenomorph survival horror show, I wish Id stopped after the first half-dozen. Thats not to say Isolation is anywhere near as bad as Colonial Marines, but its crime is equally egregious: it is a great idea that, in practice, not only wears out its welcome, but drags on so long that it almost completely erases any trace of the fun I once had. Which is a whole different form of horror than I was expecting.', 'Isolation impresses out of the gate not only due to the aforementioned intro, but because its art direction and sound design dutifully nail the vibe of Ridley Scotts original 1979 film. I cant stress this enough. From the DOS-based futuristic computers and their scan-lined CRT monitors to the fear-enhancing, violin-screeched orchestral score, Isolation clearly did its homework in the A/V department. My favorite aspect of the presentation is the atmospheric use of fog. From wisps of smoke that billow out of air vents to clouds of white mist that obscure your vision when you rewire an areas life-support systems in order to aid your stealthy objectives, Isolation certainly looks and sounds like a part of the Alien universe.', 'Considering this is a survival horror game, it takes a bit longer than I expected for the alien to show up and cause trouble. I wrote off not feeling threatened for the first hour, though, because it seemed only fair to give Isolation time to lay a foundation and establish its setting, tone, premise, and characters. Amanda is likable, with a clearly defined tough-as-nails personality befitting of her mother, Signorney Weavers Ellen Ripley.', 'Once the xenomorph does start stalking you through the dark and creepy Sevastopol space station, Isolation hits its stride. It is an absolutely stressful game to play  by design. About 99% of your hunters movements and actions are unscripted, so you genuinely never know if its going to leave you alone for minutes at a time, crawl into the ventilation ducts in the ceiling and then immediately drop back down, or sniff around the room youre hiding in for three minutes, forcing you to wait it out. The slightest sound, light source, or sight of you will cause the serial-murdering lifeform to charge and kill you. Its impervious to your weapons  be they a pistol, shotgun, flamethrower, or crafted items such as Molotov cocktails and pipe bombs. In fact, only the latter three of these can even annoy the alien enough to force it to temporarily leave the area.', 'A slower, quieter crouched walk from locker to storage cabinet to under a desk is often the safest method of progression, but as youll come to learn, the aliens unpredictability is both Isolations greatest strength as well as its most crippling weakness.', 'The typical encounter in Isolation goes like this: you get a warning pulse from your painstakingly recreated motion tracker, hear the unsettling sound of the alien spawning into the area as it drops in from an overhead air duct. You hide in a locker, storage cabinet, or under a desk, stare at your motion tracker until the creature completely leaves the area, and then you proceed as quietly as possible toward your next objective.', 'And for the first several hours of gameplay, that formula works to tense, satisfying effect. Yes, youll die  a lot, if youre like me  but during this honeymoon period, Isolation effectively keeps the pressure on. Manually activated, wall-mounted telephones are the only way to save your progress, so reaching the next one genuinely feels like a miniature victory unto itself, and getting impaled by the alien before you can pick up the receiver is a dramatic defeat. The clomping of the aliens footsteps, the bassy whump of it skittering around in the air vents above you, its angry shrieks and hisses, having to lean back and hold your breath as it sniffs for you while youre hiding in a locker, inches away from its acidic spittle  they all make Isolation very good at ensuring that youre never comfortable while trying to get the hell off the Sevastopol. A handful of timed hacking minigames you must complete while the creature can be lurking anywhere are also high points of fear.', 'Unfortunately, the campaign mirrors the Sevastopol itself: the longer it drags on, the more it falls apart as it begins to tumble out of orbit and towards a gas giant. Ripleys nightmare became my own as Isolation moved its goalposts back so many damn times that it was almost comical. First is an oddly extended, alien-free stretch midway through that pits you against aggro androids instead of organic terrors. Mercifully, the bots can be killed, but not without well-placed headshots from firearms that are cumbersome to reload. That, and the scares disappear without the singularly lethal force stalking you. This is not a first-person shooter, though it occasionally pretends to be.', 'Worse, I strongly believed that Isolation was ending on at least two separate occasions, with the second of those times even seeing the resolution of Ripleys original motivation: to get some sort of lead or closure on her missing mother. It turned out I wasnt even close  I had another few hours to go, but now without any real reason behind it. Your objective is a final-sounding Escape the station for a good eight hours or so, but with so many errands to do along the way  not to mention the incessant and irritating backtracking across the entire ship  Isolation falls into a pit of frustrating repetition from which it cannot escape.', 'Rather than throw a new gameplay twist at you, Isolation, like so many games before it, simply spends hours making you run a fun-less gauntlet and contend with everything its thrown at you so far simultaneously, including human, android, and extraterrestrial foes. Fright dissolved into frustration as I got killed from behind for the umpteenth time  even as I was crouched motionless and out of sight in an air duct. The survival-horror joy found in the campaigns early hours is completely and permanently erased. Even when you finally  finally!  reach the end, its an underwhelming conclusion that doesnt adequately pay off the 15-20 hours you just survived.', 'And in hindsight, playing on Hard difficulty  which I only did because Isolation actually describes it as the recommended way to experience the game  was a terrible decision. It means the Xenomorph can get you anywhere at any time, giving you no opportunity to avoid death, and run you down if it hears so much as a pin drop. Sure, a flamethrower blast or Molotov cocktail can ward it off for a moment, but alien-repelling resources are extremely scarce. Dont make the same mistake I did.', 'As a footnote, Isolation offers a leaderboard-based Survival Mode that challenges you to complete various scenarios with the highest score, earned by posting the fastest times and completing bonus objectives. It recommends that you not try it until youve completed the campaign, but after a protracted marathon, I didnt even want to look at it. (I did, though, to be able to tell you for sure that it wasnt worth it.)']",IGN

He's the lone goblin in a world crawling with crooked humans and elves that look like sleepy cousins of Avatar's na'vi, and his small stature means the big guys can usually take him out with a single punch. Styx: Master of Shadows itself isn't much different. It's the kind of game whose very existence might go unnoticed by those who only follow the heavyweights, but the power of some of its features could surprise those who judge it by its all-too-visible flaws. It's a rare stealth game that takes its label seriously, and it's worth seeking out if you're weary of today's assassins with a fondness for open street brawls."", ""Developer Cyanide knows the strength of its main character well; we first saw him back in 2012's flawed but ambitious Of Orcs and Men, where he shared the stage with an anger-prone advocate of orcish civil rights. It doesn't hurt that Styx is a likable sort; his predilection for well-timed F-bombs and exemplary voice work allow him to carry weak scenes that might have tripped up the whole story in less-capable hands."", ""He finds human friends as he scrambles through the pleasingly vertical levels of the Tower of Akenash - an elaborate structure surrounding a world tree that's being harvested for its sap - but they mainly exist as foils to better showcase his wit and snark. The graphics aren't advanced, and most of the time our garrulous goblin tiptoes through textures that look as though they took a wrong turn half a decade ago. But Master of Shadows uses the dark Fable-style art to good effect in most settings, and the low demands means it's generally possible to maintain high framerates at the best settings even on weaker PCs."", ""Styx clings to its stealth focus as tightly as an assassin wears his mask - one slip, and the whole gig threatens to dissolve into chaos. That's a good thing. Styx is at his best when he's focused on the business of not being seen; when he's hiding in bins and slinking through suspiciously goblin-sized ducts dotting the six stages ahead of him. He's in his element among the shadows crowding the bleak prisons and sewers of the tower, and Master of Shadows wisely encourages interacting with the environment to cup out candle flames or using well-placed spitballs crafted from sand to extinguish them from afar. All the while, he sneaks behind the guards and researchers populating the sprawling complex, either muffle-killing them so as not to arouse suspicion or driving his dagger through them in hastier (and noisier) moments."", ""That's enough to make Styx a stealth game worth noticing, and it works so well that the option to vomit out a clone to distract guards and flip distant switches usually feels like an unnecessary contrivance. Far more worrisome are the controls and edge detection, which turn what should be the simple act of dropping down to hold onto a ledge into a labor worthy of Hercules. Sometimes Styx will simply jump down, usually into plain sight of guards who leap at the chance to test the sharpness of their blades. At other times, he finds that ledges he jumps toward can't be grabbed at all, thus negating 15 minutes' worth of careful sneaking. I learned in time to live with such issues, partly because the enormous levels mean that there's almost always another route to an objective, and much of the joy of playing lies in this exploration and picking up the collectible coins scattered about."", ""But our little green friend never fully deviates from this same pattern across roughly 15 hours of play, and thus the dull pangs of repetition inevitably crept in once I became accustomed to Styx's rhythms. Cyanide generally manages to keep it at bay through the challenges of its attentions to realism, such as the tendency of shadows to merely conceal rather than render Styx fully invisible. (In this, it distinguishes itself as more hardcore than 1998's Thief.) Everywhere Styx piles on tension with its acceptable AI soldiers, who patrol a tad too predictably but grow nail-bitingly suspicious of the goblin's pitter-patter across stone floors and Styx's tendency to bump into chairs and brooms. Styx eventually unlocks abilities that let him, say, more more quietly or perform aerial assaults, but they never quite manage to outweigh the core game of sneaking and strangling."", ""The approach works so well because our goblin is alone in a world where humans appear to be the size of cave trolls, and getting caught almost always means death. (On the hardcore Goblin mode, its one hit and splat - Styx goes down to cross the river for which he's named.) It's a smart design that lends meaning to the need for stealth, as do the infrequent checkpoints that force you to get your thief on right the first time. (Thankfully, the option to save at any point eases some of the pain for those unwilling to endure such trials all over again.)"", ""But getting caught is the least of Styx's troubles; far more dangerous is the quick-time event he's locked into when an enemy finds him and prepares to skewer him. To event itself isn't so bad, as you simply press a button on the gamepad or keyboard to parry strikes at the right time before triggering an option to kill. The problem is that surrounding enemies can continue to slice at Styx and throw knives at him while he's stuck in the combat animation. Inevitably, he dies. I get that Styx isn't supposed to get caught in the first place, but such an inescapable trap feels cheap and forced."", ""It's a credit to the work that Cyanide has done here that those duels never fully ruin the experience. You'll need them. This is a game that's all about seizing the right opportunity at the right moment, leaving little room for effort, and it satisfies an itch for hardcore stealth that goes all too often unscratched these days.""]",IGN

It did have its share of pacing blemishes though - blemishes I was really hoping that a new standalone game like Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel would fix. It doesnt, but it does provide an entertaining story and a handful of successful gameplay additions that spice up its already excellent core of shooting and looting. This is, essentially, more of the Borderlands I love with just enough new twists to pull me back in, and mostly make up for the things the series still doesnt get right.', ""The real star of the show in The Pre-Sequel is Jack. In Borderlands 2 he was perhaps the most gleefully sadistic, and effective video game villain since Final Fantasy 6's Kefka. Seeing his journey from hero to maniac is perhaps the biggest reason to make the 20-or-so-hour trek across Pandoras moon, Elpis. Writer Anthony Burch shows a real knack for storytelling here, drawing a more sympathetic portrait of Jack without ever making him into the cliched misunderstood villain. He's every bit the hilarious, ego-centric asshat here that we remember him as, and his excellently written and delivered dialogue is responsible for the lion's share of the laughs."", 'Its a good thing too, because those laughs were often all there was to carry me through the long stretches of purposeless wandering around with barely anything to fight. This is part of a problem Borderlands has had since the beginning, and The Pre-Sequel hasnt solved it. The inadequate waypoint system that doesnt save you from going in circles while looking for your next objective, the boring trek back to your quest-giver at missions end... its all still here. The early hours on the moon were particularly trying, since everything is incredibly spread out, and every low-gravity jump takes seemingly forever. I just dont want to walk towards a diamond on my mini-map for god knows how long to get to where the fun is.', 'And I really dont want to go on a multi-step wild switch hunt to trigger said fun once I get there. The Pre-Sequel is cardinally guilty of this one. Apparently neither the Hyperion or Dahl corporations know how to make doors in space, because almost every single one you need to go through requires you to throw a breaker or manual override somewhere back in the area you just slogged through. In a game about shooting and looting, I should be doing those things almost constantly, but in The Pre-Sequel there were times when 10 or more minutes could easily pass without me doing much of either. Things do pick up in the latter half of the campaign, but this sort of buck-and-stall pacing has plagued the series for years, and it gets harder to forgive with each iteration.', 'But once The Pre-Sequel hits its stride, we get down to what Borderlands has always done best: the bullets start flying, the loot starts dropping, and joyful chaos ensues. The Pre-Sequel delivers a whole lot of that, starting with its four new playable characters and their positively nutty skill trees. Their action skills feel wildly different from one another, and from any of the vault hunters that have preceded them.', 'Wilhelms flying drone duo, Wolf and Saint, really stands out. Not only does one of them go on automated bombing runs against nearby enemies, but the other hangs back to heal him, or even your allies with the proper skill points invested. Nishas washes the screen in classic Western sepia, turning her into a godless, gunslinging killing machine for a short while, which is a bit more straightforward, but no less satisfying. Athenas shield allows her to go all Captain America on fools, but Claptraps is by far the craziest, granting him different abilities depending on the situation at hand. Those who love a more anarchic, unpredictable approach to combat will get all the mayhem theyd like out of it.', 'In fact, everyones  skill trees are flush with abilities that reward specific playstyles with powerful temporary effects, like mini achievements you unlock over and over. Borderlands mascot robot Claptrap, now playable for the first time, is the best example. I happen to be a compulsive reloader with a mild death wish, so his Boomtrap skill tree seems to have been made just for me. By rapidly reloading, I can get a variety of big buffs that have explosive results, but at the cost of some health and accuracy. Oh and I have chance of actually griefing my teammates with my action skill (serves you right for joining my game without an invite...jerk). Just reading some of the other characters high-level skills made me think, How does THAT work? A copy of whatever gun Im holding appears in my off-hand? I turn into a walking nuclear bomb? I just had to try this stuff out.', 'The Pre-Sequel has a few other tricks up its sleeve too, and most of them work out. Not the new Stingray hovercraft  which handles like a wet mop with a ceiling fan strapped to it  but the new low-gravity mechanics are a success. Coming to grips with my elongated jumps took a while, but once it clicked, I started using my new freedom to deadly effect. It becomes so easy to put space between you and your enemies that sniping becomes a more viable option, and being able to bound over cover to slam down behind your foes cover makes getting up close and personal easier, and more satisfying than ever.', 'The new gearing options are a blast too. Freezing enemies solid with cold-based attacks and burning them to a crisp with the new laser-class weapons feels great, but just wait until you see some of the mods that come on the Oz kits that keep you breathing in space. Some grant you accuracy and damage bonuses while airborne, while others give you an entirely different set of buffs depending on whether youre in vacuum or atmosphere. The Pre-Sequel is really generous with loot, too, so youll have plenty of opportunities to shape your character in interesting ways. I mean, my Claptrap basically waltzes into the middle of groups of enemies and decimates them exclusively by reloading and dying. I cant think of another game I can do that in.']",IGN
174,Ancient Space,2-Oct-14,T.J. Hafer,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/02/ancient-space-review,"['I made the jump into Ancient Space, looking to replenish my fleet-based, sci-fi RTS reserves, and what I found did the trickbut only just. Around me shimmered a constellation of gorgeous environmental art, strong mission variety, and impressive tactical depth. But the more I saw, the more I felt weighed down by the gravity of uninspired story presentation, and gameplay elements that sound better on paper than they are in practice.', 'The 20-hour campaign launched me into orbit around an Event Horizon-esque expedition exploring a mysterious area of space called The Black Zone, on the trail of a supercarrier that went missing while investigating a possible alien threat. Across 15 missions, I was treated to a moderately engaging story with some cool twists, but no especially outstanding or memorable characters. Starship Troopers alum Dina Meyer gave a respectable, grounded performance as the expeditions de facto leader, but most of the rest of the cast (including Fireflys Ron Glass and Battlestars Aaron Douglas) sounded like they just came out of hypersleep and werent entirely aware of what was going on. Plot details were mostly delivered Captains Log-style, with disconnected monologues between missions, stymying chances for character interaction and making the story feel less alive and personal.', 'The fleet I was to command through this narrative was anchored by persistent hero-unit capital ships, complete with voice-acted captains (including those mentioned above) and a host of potent special abilities. Joining them along the way were just over a dozen gradually-unlocked constructible ships, ranging from small, scrappy fighter squadrons to impressive, photon cannon-equipped bruisers that stood as near equals with my heroes. Each ship type has three upgrade slots for damage, armor, and speed, and my primary carrier was eventually able to earn several tiers of progressively powerful perks, adding up to a satisfying supply of fleet customization.', 'Unfortunately, these choices didnt have much of an impact in the inconsistently paced real-time battles ahead of me. Combat uses a rigid rock-paper-scissors formula based on the type of a ships hullSmall, Medium, Large, Extra Large, and Buildings. Most ships weapons can only damage two or three of these, and plink almost entirely harmlessly off of all others. There are no generalists, and upgrades only play to bolstering the strengths of a given ship typenever shoring up its weaknesses. I could have 12 ships with no damage bonus against Medium targets, and they would take far longer to kill a single Medium enemy than one friendly ship that did have such a bonus.', 'While this encouraged fleet diversity, it also had the unpleasant side-effect of forcing me to micromanage every single one of my units almost constantly. I spent most of the larger battles with the action paused, calling out individual targets for each ship, since the unit AI isnt smart enough to prioritize foes its guns can actually make a dent in. Even on the lowest difficulty, manual target selection seemed mandatory. The really cool clickable abilities (like cloaking and EMP missiles) that differentiate each ship type qualitatively take a back seat to this constant target management. Control groups can alleviate this problem somewhat, but those with an allergy to intense micromanagement shouldnt even enter the kitchen where Ancient Space has been cooking. \n', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'The strategic side is relatively shallow in comparison. There are resource-generating nodes on each map that can be tapped with space stations and upgraded with static defenses, but in most missions, they were simply unnecessary. My resource counters ticked up at such a generous rate that I rarely needed to build a structure to keep my fleet at the population cap. I could certainly plop down buildings as I went along, but doing so only ever seemed to drag out the mission length for very little economic reward. This removed all considerations related to map control that may have made certain missions more interesting, and my only real concern outside of combat was determining which units to bring to a fight.', 'This isnt to say that the missions arent enjoyable. No two in the campaign had me facing the exact same objectives, and some of them were genuinely tense and rewarding experiences. In particular, missions that charged me with defending a static point or running an enemy blockade required quick thinking, good unit synergy, and smart use of capital ship abilities in order to come out victorious. One such scenario involved covering a transport evacuation, Battlestar Galactica-style, while under heavy fire from all directions. Things came right down to the wire, with all of my units battered or destroyed, plugging a bottleneck in a desperate final stand as the last civilian ship made its getaway.', '', 'If only it played as good is it looks.', 'On the other hand, missions that required me to assault a fortified position quickly became frustrating, drawn-out slugfests until I unlocked the late-campaign tech needed to take down buildings and capital ships quickly. The fragility of many of my fleets core units, and the sluggish pace at which I could replace them, meant I was spending most offensive missions prodding the enemy installation, losing all of my fighters in the first 30 seconds (in spite of healing abilities), and being forced to gun my impulse engines in full reverse and repopulate. These situations werent difficult because I made bad decisions; they were difficult because I didnt have the patience to continually redirect and otherwise babysit all of my cannon fodder for the duration of a long fight.', 'The missing polish in both the story and mechanics felt like a shame, considering the imaginative and consistently beautiful level art and ship designs seemed to hint at what could have been a much more epic and satisfying tale. Every map is constructed with soaring, titan-scaled asteroids and alien ruins. Friendly and enemy hulls look bolted together with the loving care of an art team who had a deeper understanding for and appreciation of this universe than I was ever given the opportunity to develop. The scenario-based challenge mode certainly didnt give me that, either. Considering that this is a single-player only game, its disappointing more care wasnt given to making me feel like a part of this universe.', ' ']",IGN
175,Defense Grid 2,14-Oct-14,Dan Stapleton,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/14/defense-grid-2-review,"['Just like the 2008 original, Defense Grid 2 is the kind of game I can sit down with intending to play a quick 30 minutes, only to look up and find three hours have passed. This brand of extremely addictive min-maxing tower defense retains all the strength of the first game and adds a new layer of complexity that promises to extend replayablity - even if it cant repeat the originals unexpectedly emotional story.', 'This isnt one of those sequels that sets out to reinvent itself, so its 20 levels are largely slight variations on the excellent Defense Grid puzzles weve done before: a stream of alien invaders run the same path to your precious power cores and attempt to abscond with them (generally along the same path they came in on) while you attempt to fry them with a selection of strategically placed upgradable gun turrets. Its a game of meticulous min-maxing optimization, and it inspires obsessive levels of tweaking tower placement and resource expenditures by making it extremely easy and consequence-free to jump back in time a few seconds to prevent an alien from escaping with an orbital laser blast, or rethink that hard-hitting laser tower in favor of a concussion tower thats better for taking out the incoming swarm of small targets.', 'Defense Grid 2 contributes some relatively minor tweaks and increased variety. Versatile new Boost towers allow you to cheaply block off alien routes to extend the amount of time you have to beat on them, build towers on top of them to gain elevation for better firing angles, and upgrade them with power- or score-boosting effects. Since Defense Grid 2 very wisely ditches the annoying flying enemies that could only be effectively destroyed with Missile towers, the Missile towers are now redesigned to attack ground targets. That makes them feel a bit redundant to the also long-range Meteor tower, but their stats are different enough to make them useful in different scenarios.', 'You can differentiate them further with unlockable modifiers that allow you to alter towers with traits like improved splash damage, at the cost of lower overall damage, or enhanced effectiveness against shields. You can also pick an alternate superweapon, such as a time-slowing device or an extra resource infusion. Im excited about all the extra replayability Ill get out of Defense Grid 2 because of this, but Im a little annoyed I have to lock them in before I start a match. It leads to situations where I have to play once, quit all the way out, change my settings, and start up again.', 'The other significant new feature is that you can spend resources to change the layout of a level in pre-set ways, raising or moving chunks of track or buildable pads. The option to spend money on things other than a new tower or an upgrade opens up lots of new possibilities - having already gold-medaled 18 of 20 levels by barely touching this option, I was intrigued when I started opening up entirely new strategies on certain maps.', 'On top of all of this, there are now eight mode modifiers you can apply to any of the 20 maps. Theres one with 100 waves of enemies (up from the usual 20 to 30), one that allows you to directly deal damage by hovering the cursor over an alien, and one that prevents the cores from traveling back to the center of the map when the alien carrying it is killed. It gives you lots of extra ways to play, and each mode has its own leaderboard  fighting for dominance on those can create some intense rivalry.', 'I found the biggest disappointment in the story  though in the grand scheme of things, having any story at all in a tower defense game is something of a luxury. The disappointment is the result of an expectation created by the surprising emotional depth in the first games monologue from your AI sidekick, General Fletcher, who was both brilliantly written and voice-acted with heart. Fletcher returns in Defense Grid 2, but the script is almost entirely forgettable and some of the voice acting from some of the cast of new characters - particularly Commander Simon - is just eye-rollingly bad.', 'Finally, theres multiplayer, which sadly doesnt add anything good to Defense Grid 2. I had some brief fun with the competitive mode, which transports aliens your towers kill to your opponents map at the same corresponding spot where they died, but its too chaotic and unpredictable, and lacks the ability to rewind or change the speed of time.', 'The two co-op multiplayer modes are just annoying. First of all, you cant step back or speed up time because its multiplayer, so its both slow and crippled compared to the single-player experience. Second, youre both pulling from the same resource pool, so unless youre both totally on the same wavelength the whole time, you can have your partner spend the resources you were saving up for a big tower upgrade, and theres no way to undo except sell the tower at a loss. Its silly.']",IGN
176,Project Spark,7-Oct-14,Mitch Dyer,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/07/project-spark-review,"['As I was learning my way around Project Spark, a passerby told me, that looks like work. Sometimes, I felt that way too. This is a game about making games, and it functions comparably to game engines such as Unreal or Unity. It can be complicated, tedious, and frustrating -- but the reward for overcoming the challenges of creation is having something your friends, family, and the world can play. This, above all else, makes something thats already smart and fun even more exciting.', 'The part of Project Spark that functions like an actual game is an episodic single-player campaign that demonstrates whats possible, as well as how you can create useful and fun logic for characters and objects. Its a helpful first step, but it isnt enough to guide you to make something whole. Plus, its 3D action game simplicity isnt terribly enjoyable on its own. But at any point, if you own the objects Project Spark sells piecemeal, you can stop playing and start editing right then and there to figure out how something operates.', 'Everything in Project Spark has a Brain, in which you can modify how an object responds when something happens to it. Im a game design daydreamer with no formal training, so navigating complicated menus to create artificial intelligence behaviors is terrifying, and getting them to work can be challenging, even in spite of its helpful visual scripting. But its interesting, satisfying, and really fun to design a space from scratch, populate it with people, and see them respond to a player character with dialogue you wrote, or a big event you scripted. It feels good to make something. It feels better when someone says its cool.', 'Project Spark is a sandbox and a playground for your creativity, and its relatively easy to jump in and start creating. Its also really, really hard to make something that isnt awful. The tools tend to result in a lot of similar, generic, and unremarkable action games. The level of depth permits stronger, more thoughtful games, but itll take the community time to dig beneath the surface to achieve something truly great.', 'That all of those tools are available for free is amazing. Project Sparks $40 starter set gives you a ton of new props for visual variety, and the DLC packs have even more, but everything you need to make something is available for free. Understanding these systems takes time and effort, but Project Spark is reasonably accessible. Because Sparks tutorials only scratch the surface of what it can do, I relied heavily on YouTube videos to tell me how to use a boolean variable, or what an objects vector means. Now theyre core to the kinds of games Im making with friends -- and making games with friends is where Project Spark becomes something truly special.', 'Cooperative design is easily the best thing about Project Spark. I enjoyed my time alone, tinkering with 2D platformers and 3D action games, but having someone else to help make your game design dreams come true is legitimately among my favorite game experience in a while.', 'While my friend created an interactive sequence later in our 2D platformer level, I decorated an early scene with new lighting, visual effects, and props. He, the designer, me, the artist. In another game, I used Project Sparks flexible tools to create walls, paths, and visual cues. Thats level design. Meanwhile, he was making a non-playable character respond to player interactions using the Brain editors visual programming. We argued about what was best for the game versus what was best for the player. We solved problems together, and he cleaned up my messes. This isnt exactly like being a development team -- but like Rock Band is awesome for wannabe rockstars, Project Spark is a terrific approximation of what it might be like to work at a video game studio. Here, though, you actually create something you can share, and doing it together is as good as Project Spark gets.', 'Its still very early in its life, so right now most of what Project Sparks community has made is...lacking in quality, to say the least. People are still learning whats possible though, and I found myself giving high ratings to games that accomplished novel things I didnt know how to do, rather than games I actually thought were good.', 'Theres potential here, even if most of the action games are garbage Fable clones, or straight-up remakes of other games. But imitation is a helpful way to learn.', 'To be fair, my games are simple, pointless, or too limited to be good. I have not made anything Im comfortable sharing publicly, and Im not sure I ever will. But what I have is a small collection of things representing my growth as a creator. Im proud of what Ive made -- even though youd probably hate it. If you spend time with Project Spark, you might appreciate my cool cave-in sequence, or the fixed camera right behind my main character. Maybe youll make something youve always dreamed of, or learn from my mistakes.']",IGN
177,Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition,8-Oct-14,Colin Moriarty,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/08/sleeping-dogs-definitive-edition-review,"[""Many open-world, non-linear drive-and-gun games -- with some notable exclusions -- tend to tack on a story merely to loosely justify whatever it is you're doing. But the main thing I made clear in my original review of Sleeping Dogs on Xbox 360 and PS3 back in 2012 is that while it's a blast to play, its story is actually the star of the show. The Definitive Edition for new-gen consoles carries over both of those great traits and adds a decent facelift, and it's just as fun and just as memorable as it was the first time around. An engaging plot littered with memorable characters and a ton of slowly building tension is artfully coupled with solid melee action, gunplay, and driving to create a multi-faceted game that satisfies on all fronts."", '', '', '', '', ""As far as the aesthetic is concerned, Sleeping Dogs was never an exceptionally pretty game, but The Definitive Edition resolves some of its biggest visual faults and brings it more in line with the PC version. On the Xbox One version I played, draw distances are vastly extended, textures are much sharper, and the overall gloss of the entire convincing recreation of Hong Kong is improved. It doesn't look like a native new-gen game by any stretch of the imagination, however - and its disappointing that the framerate stutters a bit when you're on foot running around and exploring, and the camera is still a bit messy in certain circumstances."", ""Again, though, I have to sing the praises of the story. Sleeping Dogs revolves around an undercover Hong Kong detective named Wei Shen. Shen  who's voiced wonderfully by Will Yun Lee in both English and Cantonese, is an interesting protagonist, one with true depth. Shens embedded himself with the Hong Kong underworld in order to unravel it from within, and watching him get sucked further and further into peril is fascinating. He's not a nameless hero or a loosely constructed anyman. He seems as real as a character in a movie."", ""Of course, Sleeping Dogs has plenty for you if story isn't your thing. Its driving mechanics are on-point, with lots of different vehicles toting unique feels, from run-down motorcycles and hulking industrial trucks to supped-up sedans and expensive sports cars, and everything in between. Developer United Front Games has crafted a believable and incredibly busy version of Hong Kong that's simply a blast to drive around, explore, and uncover. Likewise, fighting -- whether with your fists, a melee weapon, or a firearm -- is also a lot of fun. There's a ton of collectibles to discover in addition to its meaty campaign, with tons of offshoot side quests to complete. In short, Sleeping Dogs is bound to keep you very busy not only when keeping up with its story, but in simply doing everything within it there is to do."", ""Content-wise, the only notable difference between the old-gen version of Sleeping Dogs and the Definitive Edition is the inclusion of DLC. Both the supernatural-themed Nightmare in North Point and the cop-centric Year of the Snake are included, though I wasn't blown away by either. These separate packs -- which feel disjointed and aren't a part of the campaign -- don't stack up with the likes of GTA IVs The Lost and the Damned or The Ballad of Gay Tony in terms of the amount of content, the quality of the new characters, or even new objectives. But, it's pretty cool that they're here in case you want to mess with them."", ""Testing out Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition reminded me of a facet I hadn't thought much about since I last played it in 2012: its multi-tiered leveling system. This experience rubric provides Shen with rewards in three different categories: as a cop, as a member of the criminal Triad, and as a citizen of Hong Kong. Earning experience points in these three categories often conflicts with one another, and each category has unique skills associated with it. Delving into this system is a ton of fun, and it's really cool watching Shen get stronger based on how I chose to behave. Displaying disregard for the citizens of Hong Kong won't net you much love in your Face meter, for instance, but upholding the law will surely bring you plenty of cop experience points.""]",IGN
178,Fairy Fencer F,3-Oct-14,Meghan Sullivan,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/03/fairy-fencer-f-review,"['Fairy Fencer F is a plucky little role-playing game that hides its best assets under a blanket of banality. Beneath the subpar graphics and cliche story lies strong combat, lovable characters, and an abundance of customization options. It may not be the deepest or most innovative RPG, but it has a lot of heart.', 'Fencers (those able to wield fairy-infused weapons) collecting Furies (said fairy-infused weapons) is what drives the straightforward plot, which doesnt offer much in the way of excitement or surprises. Thats a shame, especially since youd think a story about preventing an apocalyptic resurrection of warring gods would be more a lot more interesting.', 'Luckily, Fairy Fencer Fs ho-hum story is buoyed up by its likable characters. Everyone from the lazy, self-centered protagonist Fang to the stuck-up Tiara, boasts distinct personalities, enhanced by voice actors who really chew the scenery with hilariously over-the-top line delivery. Admittedly, a lot of the non-voiced dialogue is pretty asinine, but the translation team slyly sprinkles in some Western humor to spice things up, including terms like tsundere masochistic and an allusion to a famous Space Balls quote that that had me cracking up. This one-two punch of cheeky localization and enthusiastic voice over kept me engaged in Fairy Fencer F long after I stopped caring about the plot.', 'When I wasnt laughing at silly banter, I was happily shaping what kind of Fencer I wanted each of them to be. Customization in Fairy Fencer F is fun thanks to a flexible system that lets you distribute experience points however you want. I could, for example, increase Fangs basic sword prowess, or unlock combo attacks that can be chained together to give combat a satisfyingly rhythmic feel.', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'You can also boost a Fencers stats by equipping them with fairies found in acquired Furies. Its best to pair Fencers with a fairy that reflects their strengths (i.e. equipping Fang with a fire-based fairy that will enhance his pyro spells), but I like that I could change out these tiny beings to score all types of different benefits like higher attack percentages in battle or extra experience points. And any fairies not equipped were put to good use with World Shaping, a nifty feature that lets you change the parameters of a dungeon to your advantage.', 'Even a fairys World-Shaping powers are customizable thanks to Godly Revival, a mode that lets you remove one of the special Furies used to seal away the gods, then fuse it with a fairy to give that fairy an extra stat boost. I didnt quite understand why actions in Godly Revival dont tie into the story more (you dont actually need to remove all the Furies from a sleeping god to finish the game), but nevertheless I liked being able to increase a fairys effectiveness in battle.', 'Speaking of battle, I really dig Fairy Fencers combat, which offers a surprising amount of lateral movement during an enemy encounter. I could move my Fencers around the battlefield, adjust a spells AoE using the L1/R1 buttons to target specific enemies, choose from a wide variety of magics and abilities, and even transform into Fury form, a type of overdrive that lets Fencers use a special skillset for a limited time. This broad range of attack options kept the turn-based combat system fresh and interesting, even when the same enemies appeared over and over (and over) again to challenge my Fencers.', '', 'Amano, where are you?', 'Difficulty wise, enemies dont offer much of a challenge, save for the tough-as-nails minibosses. That might seem like a bad thing, but I reveled in the speed and ease with which I dispatched monsters, since it made me feel nigh invincible when charging through Fairy Fencers linear, bland-looking dungeons. There was much ado about famed Final Fantasy artist Yoshitaka Amano being this projects concept designer, but his influence on the world design is barely detectable in the cheap-looking environments and cutscenes.', 'Also conspicuous is the absence of composer Nobuo Uematsu, whose collaboration on the soundtrack was hyped up, but whose actual contribution feels somewhat limited. Thats not to say the music in Fairy Fencer F is bad (I like its light, whimsical sound), but theres nothing memorable about it either.', '', 'Clearly not here.', 'Luckily, Fairy Fencer Fs aesthetics do have a few bright spots. The battle animations are cool to watch, especially when Fencers transform into Fury form. This triggers a frenzied cutscene complete with rockin guitar riffs that made me laugh with their over-the-top presentation. I also liked the character designs, which are done by Hyperdimension Neptunia artist Tsunako. Theyre not terribly original, but theyre nice to look at, and I appreciate that only one of the characters is designed with fan service in mind.', 'I managed to zip through Fairy Fencer F in a little over 30 hours, but those with compulsive tendencies can spend many more hours finding and collecting all 100 Furies hidden throughout the world. You can also start a new game+ in case you missed a Fury, or want to reach the top of Shukesoos Tower, a bonus dungeon that grows with every Fury left in the ground during World Shaping.']",IGN
179,Driveclub,7-Oct-14,Luke Reilly,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/07/driveclub-review,"['Beneath Driveclubs bleeding-edge visuals and omnipresent social features lies a racer rooted in traditional, arcade racing tropes. The handling is easy to grasp, and the focus on fictional, predefined circuits and point-to-point courses in various locations across the world places it in a category separate from super-serious circuit-lappers like Gran Turismo 6 or any of todays plentiful open-world racers. The result is a fast, fun, beautiful, and accessible racer, although its one thats a little narrower than most of its modern peers.', 'Handling trends towards the arcade side of the spectrum, yet its considerably less superficial than something like Burnout. The 50 cars in Driveclub brake hard and grip like glue, but the driving model is still nuanced enough to let you feel the difference between a bulky Bentley Continental GT and an eager John Cooper Works-tuned Mini.', 'Its one-size-fits-all handling, though. In keeping with the overall arcade sensibilities, even with a bootful of throttle Driveclubs high-horsepower hypercars spring from the line with only moderate wheelspin, and they seem mostly reluctant to about-face mid-corner in an orgy of oversteer. Even if the back end does step out it generally only takes a smidge of countersteering to correct it. I found it satisfying and entirely in line with Driveclubs direction, even if its a fraction simplistic. The biggest problem I had with it is that the handlings too sticky to make the drift events much fun; I generally found myself getting bogged down mid-corner because its surprisingly difficult to maintain momentum.', 'Driveclubs car selection is nicely curated to represent some of Europes most desirable sports cars, grand tourers, supercars and hypercars, plus a smattering of hot hatches as an entry point. They look absolutely remarkable. Theyre best enjoyed from inside the cabins, where the attention to detail is so extreme that even the windscreens show those subtle semi-circle scuffs on the glass you get from the wipers when the glare of the sun catches them. Supercars like the Marussia B2 have fully functioning screens for their rear-facing cameras mounted in the centre console in lieu of a rear-view mirror, too, which developer Evolution captured exquisitely. Even little touches like the custom door-opening sequences, tailored to the configuration of the exterior and interior door handles, go a long way in making these rides feel real in a way racing games rarely manage. They sound exceptional too; Gran Turismo could learn a lot from this example.', '', 'Driveclub looks amazing at night.', 'Its strange that the car list is so heavily biased towards European models, though; almost exclusively so, in fact. Theres actually only a single American car  the Hennessey Venom GT  and even thats really just a Texas-built powerplant shipped over to the UK and manhandled into a modified Lotus Exige. More bafflingly, there are no Japanese cars at all. No doubt theres some great stuff in Driveclub, including some properly amazing, lesser-known models that even the completely stacked Gran Turismo series is still omitting. But car lovers are nothing if not tribal, and this surprisingly insular day-one vehicle roster is going to rustle some jimmies.', 'Performance upgrades and tuning arent featured, although visual customisation is. Its not a completely freeform livery editor like the one found in the Forza series, however; its more like Grid Autosport, where you choose from a bunch of pre-set patterns, icons and numbers. I find all three distracting and garish;  flaming eight-balls look pretty daft on the side of anything. You can turn all these elements off if you want, or just race in a factory colour, but even in single-player races youre still going to find yourself pitted against a bunch of dorky-looking lime-green AI Ferraris covered in more stickers than a childs bicycle.', 'Aside from our cars, were afforded some basic driver avatar customisation, too. Theres not a great deal more to it than there is in the likes of, say, PGR4  choose a gender and select from a bunch of preset heads and shirts  but it feels like a sensible touch giving us some elementary control over what we look like behind the wheel, whether we stand up to pee or not.', '', 'A simple but welcome option, like PGR4 and TDU before it.', 'At any rate, while the garage is almost entirely Euro-centric for now, its racing locations are much less so. Tracks in Scotland and Norway are joined by routes across Canada, India, and Chile. As immaculately detailed as the cars are, I think Driveclubs tracks are doubly breathtaking. Postcard-perfect trackside vistas stretch for miles, but theyre just as capable of standing up to close scrutiny, from the individual stones in the road surface to the barely perceptible wiggle of a tautly stretched corner flag. The attention to detail is truly admirable; check out the plastic bags and Driveclub pamphlets wafting across the roads, and the multi-coloured butterflies doing the same thing. The arcade nature has brought with it a forcefield of sorts that will ricochet you away from rocky verges, clumped snow, and protruding guard rails and prevents us from interacting much with anything beyond the asphalt. But stuff like this, combined with the incredibly realistic lighting, really helps make the tracks feel alive.', 'Most of the routes are quite skinny too, which makes passing without contact a bit tricky but contributes to an excellent sense of speed. Driveclub features a few dedicated, fictional race circuits, though next to scenic blasts through sun-baked Indian scrubland and icy, Scandinavian tunnels, they feel quite boring.', '', 'Driveclub nixes ugly racing lines for coloured corner flags that indicate their severity.', 'Perhaps as a side-effect of the narrow roads, the racing can tend to be quite aggressive; AI cars have a habit of blitzing past you suddenly and at great speed, and more than once I was poleaxed out of contention with just a corner or two to go. Theres no mechanical damage, but there is a speed-retarding penalty system for harsh collisions. It doesnt seem to apply to the AI, only to us, and its annoyingly inconsistent. Sometimes a slight tap when going two wide on a corner will trigger it, yet a massive shunt will go unnoticed. Its irritating and caused me a few restarts, but thankfully wasnt too common.', 'A single-player progression system breaks up the racing with time trials and drift events. I quite enjoy the former; hotlapping against ghosts can become pretty compulsive.', 'Of course, as with many of 2014s big-ticket racers, connectivity is part of Driveclubs key shtick  and it works well. Every track is populated with face-off challenges for us to try and beat in the process of racing or hotlapping: smash a friends (or strangers) average speed, drift score, or the like on a marked segment of track, and youll be rewarded with XP. Participate in (or create and share) custom challenge events, and youll be rewarded with XP based on your spot on the ladder when the challenge expires. I had a bunch of these challenges on the boil at a time, and by ranking decently I had a steady stream of XP accumulating even when I wasnt playing. I really like this kind of asynchronous multiplayer; its much like the Forza series Rivals mode.', '', 'Skilful driving also racks up XP; the spirit of PGR lives on in Driveclub.', 'Its a good thing these social challenges exist alongside the straightforward multiplayer racing, because it only takes a few days to mostly exhaust Driveclubs single-player event slate, and thatll leave you far short of unlocking all 50 cars. A clean and simple interface makes navigating to events and quickly jumping into challenges and pre-packaged multiplayer races extremely uncomplicated.', 'Joining or creating an online race team of likeminded friends  your club  of between two and six players is important too. As rewards are shared among members, and also because five of Driveclubs cars (including the mental BAC Mono) can only be unlocked by levelling up your club, being part of an active club is beneficial. You wont be privy to all Driveclub offers playing as a so-called Free Agent. (You cant have the name Pickleweasel, though, because I already took it.) Your individual achievements contribute to your club XP too, although as a part of a club you can also tackle the club-only challenges. Theyre much like the individual challenges, and equally fun; each member can attempt the challenge, and the best club effort wins. However, Driveclub is overzealously protective of these precious cars: if you leave the club (or, as I discovered, play when the PSN is down), the cars are locked again.']",IGN

That single sentence defines the gorgeous world of Ethan Carter perfectly: like Gone Home and Dear Esther, its a fantastic first-person exploration game that focuses on tone, freedom, and environmental storytelling in lieu of combat.', 'You play a detective on the trail of the titular missing boy in rural Wisconsin. You have the ability to see into the past and piece together memory fragments, which play out in the form of Ethan Carters great puzzles. These smart challenges reward you with bits of backstory, and the actual act of solving them fit in with the eerie Lovecraftian tone.', 'My favorite puzzle had me using scratch paper to piece together the former layout of a now-burned-down house from flashes of someone elses memories. Its rare that a game in 2014 gets me jotting down physical notes, but like Fez, Device 6, and Legend of Grimrock, Ethan Carter trusts that you have the patience and drive to solve its mysteries.', 'The puzzles simultaneously provide interesting challenges, smart world building, and insight into who you are and the folks wrapped up in this disappearance truly are. On top of this, the writing does does a fantastic job of creating distinct characters and an effective gothic-horror vibe. Interesting parables are scattered throughout the world, and while theyre certainly entertaining on a surface level, digging a bit deeper into their subtext helps flesh out Ethan Carters main story in some really great ways. The way events unfold and the mysteries that linger after the credits roll trust you to come to your own conclusions, which is how I like my storytelling delivered.', 'Aside from the writing, a lot of Ethan Carters power also comes from impeccable environmental storytelling. Right from the get-go, youre free to explore the wilderness to your hearts content. Areas can be visited in any order you want, delivering a sort of freedom that allowed me to personalize my time. It takes about 25 minutes to run across the breadth of Ethan Carters wilderness, but youll definitely want to take your time and soak it in. The world is filled with tiny details and scraps of information that beg to be devoured. Which is fantastic, because The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is one of the most gorgeous games I have ever played.', 'Whats even more impressive is that you right from the start, you can wander anywhere you want without without a single loading screen to pull your out of the experience. Seriously, I cant count the number of times I stopped moving and just lingered on a view throughout my three-hour journey. Sprawling valleys, shimmering lakes, and autumnal forests make Ethan Carter one of those games where I want to screencap nearly every single moment.', 'The keyword there is nearly, because while I loved most of my time in Ethan Carter, theres one area thats much weaker than the rest. I found myself spending far too much time lost in a visually unimpressive mine trying to solve a particularly frustrating puzzle. When I finally discovered the solution after one of the longest hours of my gaming life, I felt cheated. Unlike the rest of the puzzles, I didnt earn the reward, but rather stumbled upon it.', 'Despite that one area being notable low-point, the rest of The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is remarkable. The combination of its gorgeous visuals and powerful mysteries make it one of those games that stuck with me and begged to be replayed.']",IGN
181,NBA 2K15,9-Oct-14,Mike Mitchell,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/09/nba-2k15-review,"['NBA 2K15 steps onto the court as the reigning champion of basketball sims, but its a champion with an asterisk next to its name due to the extended server debacle of last year. Some of those online issues are repeated this year, which cripples some of NBA 2K15s coolest features. But thanks to some good tweaks and the outstanding MyCareer mode, its still a game I can recommend as a strong offline basketball game.', 'This game is drop-dead gorgeous. Running at a smooth 60 frames per second, the seamless player animations really make it feel almost as authentic as the real thing. Just like in the real NBA, Tim Duncan will hug the ball before each game, Dwayne Wade will do pull ups on the rim, and Kobe will complain when he thinks he got fouled. 2K has paid great attention to detail, and it pays off.', '2K15 reuses last years excellent TV broadcast-style presentation and heavy use of slow motion, and it looks just as stunning. That wasnt broken, so its good that it wasnt fixed. However, theres one sloppy oversight so glaring its hard not to laugh at: in the real world, Steve Kerr is now the Head Coach for the Golden State Warriors, and thats reflected in-game. However, 2K15 re-uses his voice commentary from last year anyway. Its a bit odd to hear him talking about the game one second and then seeing bizarro Steve Kerr roaming the sideline the next.', 'In the win column, a new pre-game segment featuring Ernie Johnson and Shaquille ONeal does a surprisingly great job of distracting from the long load times with some entertaining contextualized commentary. Another addition is an in-game, live-action show called NBA 2KTV, which 2K says will be updated weekly to feature player interviews, behind-the-scenes videos, tips from the developer, and even Virtual Currency giveaways. This is front and center on the sleek looking and easy-to-use main menu, though it can get pretty annoying because it restarts every time you return there.', 'On the court, NBA 2Ks core basketball gameplay is as strong as ever, with only slight adjustments from last year. Running the pick-and-roll or even the newly added triangle offense just feels so right, especially with the changes made to the defensive AI that make it more aggressive in stealing the ball from you. And including a shot meter was a brilliant idea - it gives me simple and immediate feedback, explaining exactly why I just missed an open jumper.', 'Im sad to say that online franchise mode is an afterthought in NBA 2K15. Its missing meaningful options, such as simple free agency. Conversely, the single-player franchise mode, MyGM, received a lot of love. There are almost no microtransactions (good riddance), the conversation system has been improved to give you more than just yes or no answers, and you can now earn XP even when you sim, which let me zip through a rewarding season as a manager without feeling cheated out of progress when I didnt want to play full games.', 'The star of NBA 2K15 is MyCareer mode, which has been completely upgraded in nearly every way. The brand-new story has your player go undrafted, rather than being a top pick, and having to earn my way onto the roster was a fresh and welcomed change. The way you upgrade your MyPlayer is more streamlined, too, so theres much less busywork involved. Rather than micromanaging each individual attribute, skill sets are now grouped together into categories, like Defense and Athleticism.', 'One of the most impressive things about the new MyCareer mode is that the veteran teammate that takes you under his wing finally found his voice. 2K Sports got a real NBA player from each team to actually speak for their game character, like Steph Curry for the Warriors and Demarcus Cousins for the Kings. Theyre obviously not voice actors, but it still makes a huge difference to the overall experience.', '2K15 also uses the PlayStation Camera or Xbox One Kinect to digitally map your face onto your MyPlayer, with hilariously ugly results. And, when I finally got a good scan, a server hiccup erased my face. Its a fun thing to do at parties, but I wouldnt want these monstrosities in my game.', 'But again, the 2K servers have completely destroyed several online modes. MyPark, the game mode where you take your MyPlayer onto the blacktop, is broken, despite splitting players between three separate communities. Crippling lag makes defense a guessing game, and thats only if you can stay connected. When it does work, however, you can join and create crews with your friends, and even venture into the Jordan Rec Center to play full- length games with NBA rules.', 'MyTeam, the card collecting game, is also crippled. Its too bad, because its full of additional content this year, with numerous single-player challenges that force you to think outside of the box. But the cumbersome UI just confused me, since the overall player ratings were nowhere to be found.']",IGN
182,Costume Quest 2,7-Oct-14,Dave Rudden,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/07/costume-quest-2-review,"[""Imagine you threw a Halloween party and your friend showed up with a slight variation of the same costume he or she had last year. You might be a bit disappointed by the lack of imagination, but something like that can be forgiven if the partier keeps folks laughing all night. Costume Quest 2 is like that. It sticks very close to the 2010 original's candy-collecting template, but I overlooked all that once this endearing roleplaying games characters and time-travel humor grabbed hold of me. Unfortunately, it also has a drinking problem."", ""Thats not a metaphor: Costume Quest 2 literally has a drinking problem in how frequently it forces you to run back to drinking fountains to heal up. As much as the combat has improved from the scant battle tactics in the original by way of countering, a rock-paper-scissors elemental system, costume upgrades, and a better buff system, Costume Quest 2s straightforward fights dont allow you in very many ways. The problem reared its head around two-thirds of the way through the six-hour story, when enemies get a lot stronger. Running back and forth turned the last third of Costume Quest 2 into far more of a slog than it should have been. I'm not sure why the change was made to get rid of the original Costume Quest's post-battle full health regeneration, but it wasn't for the better."", 'Costume Quest 2\'s combat as a whole, however, deserves commendation; it\'s not quite at the level of epics like Persona 4, but battles never got repetitive like they do in the original. Due to the ability to add a second attack if the first is timed right, and the option to charge a block for one character and turn it into a counter (trading off that you might not react in time if the enemy attacks one of the other two), there\'s a lot more to think about. The aforementioned buff system, now implemented via ""Creepy Treat Cards,"" offers a bit more freedom than Costume Quest\'s Battle Stamps. While the original required you attach a single attribute to each character with only 24 modifiers to play with, there are 45 different Creepy Treat Cards which can be used by any character at any time in battle with a three-to-five battle cooldown period. Most importantly, Creepy Treat Cards aren\'t mandatory like Battle Stamps, so you can forgo them for extra challenge, though there\'s a far bigger one in the form of the inanimate HP-sponge Candy Corn costume that trades a third of your attack options in each battle for a clever quip about the Halloween staple and a hard-earned Achievement/Trophy at the end of your Quest.', ""But again, everything is slowed down by those runs back to the fountain. They were annoying enough when I knew where to go to heal up, but when you enter a new part of Costume Quest 2's world, you won't have a map. You can buy a new map, but when you do, you still have to figure out where you are on that map, because it doesnt tell you. While that's not an issue with some of the more wide-open areas in the beginning, more than one of the future-set stages included far more twists and turns than the map could detail, largely because of developer Double Fine's insistence to making maps look like a child's drawings."", 'Another minor issue comes in the form of Costume Quest 2\'s itchy trigger finger. On more than one occasion each, I accidentally skipped a cutscene (that could not be replayed due to autosaving) with a single wayward button tap or accepted loss in a battle by mistakenly scrolling over to the ""run away"" battle option. A simple ""are you sure?"" prompt in each situation would have done wonders.', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', ""Yet Costume Quest 2 won me over with the colorful locales and endearing characters that popped up during Reynold and Wren's second quest to save Halloween. The time travel and resulting dystopian locations like an oppressive school and a Metropolis-style slum are great, even if the objectives haven't found therein evolved much beyond the knocking on doors and getting tricks or treats we did in the original. The formula worked then, and it works now, though without the benefit of novelty."", ""It replenishes that somewhat with a main villain, a sugar-hating dentist, who actually has personality. That's a big improvement over the originals forgettable candy-stealing monsters. The time traveling also allows you to see multiple forms of the same NPCs, which helps to even make the most common-seeming bystander a bit more memorable. That, and constant references back to old Double Fine games and Earthbound, which is one of the biggest influences for Costume Quest, make Costume Quest 2 a cute and lighthearted seasonal RPG despite a few dips in the action due to trips to the fountain.""]",IGN
183,Skylanders Trap Team,1-Oct-14,Steve Butts,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/01/skylanders-trap-team-review,"['Redeeming villains as heroes often makes for some dramatic moments, and the way Skylanders Trap Team allows portal masters the chance to play as captured villains leads this years sequel down a path of righteousness. It adds even more variety to an already massively diverse platformer RPG. Even better, Trap Team reclaims some of the series better features, like Skystones and tilting lock puzzles, which were disappointingly absent from last years Swap Force.', 'While the basic mechanics of this action platformer are solid, the characters have always been the best part of the Skylanders series, and Trap Team introduces some of the best heroes and villains yet. From a baby T-Rex with a helicopter backpack, to a candy-barfing Pinata and an Eastern-themed wind-master armed with a giant boomerang, Trap Team is full of inventiveness. The concept, design, and overall performance of the characters is a highpoint for the series. There are even new baby versions of series favorites like Spyro and Trigger Happy  sure, its a way to sell you more toys, but who doesnt want one of these guys?', 'Unfortunately, character progression suffers from an abundance of loot. Even playing as six entirely new characters, I had maxed out most of their upgrades a little over halfway through Trap Teams 10-hour story, which meant I spend the second half with practically no use for tens of thousands of pieces of treasure. This would be less of a problem if there were new upgrade options for your existing Skylanders, but that Stealth Elf youve had for three years still wont have any new ninja powers to spend her treasure on.', 'Players in co-op share treasure now, so theres no reason to compete over it. Its a small change, but it makes the two-player experience far less competitive and allows players of different skill levels to progress at the same pace with regard to upgrades. Unfortunately, the upgrade system still forces you to exit the upgrade interface after each individual purchase. That minor inconvenience adds up over time, and theres a similar fussiness with swapping villains in and out of the traps.', 'That said, playing as the villains is massively fun. Trap Team lets you play as over 40 villains, from a chef with a hot pepper for a head to a treasure chest with teeth. Its particularly cool that some of the villains have abilities that are designed to be used in co-op. Broccoli Guy can drop healing glyphs, for instance, while Chill Bill can immobilize enemies with his freeze gun. Even in single-player, its easy enough to swap back and forth between these villains and use their support abilities.', 'While the villains dont get the same sort of upgrade options as the Skylanders themselves, each villain has his or her (or its) own redemption mission somewhere in the campaign. Its a fun story moment to lead the villain through a specific challenge that brings them around to the side of the heroes, but none of the missions are co-op, which can be a bit of a snag if youre playing with a friend. Even worse, some of the missions boil down to basically saying hello to another character. It feels like kind of a cheat.', '\n', 'As great as this rogues gallery is, the abundance of awesome villains contributes to some story problems. The Doom Raiders come at you one at a time, which gives the missions a sort of villain-of-the-week feel. You jump from bad guy to bad guy so quickly that the story never really seems to focus the way that it did around Kaos in the previous games. I was also a little annoyed that some of the villains are part of a new mystery element that Eon keeps saying hell explain but never does. My guess is that the mystery will be solved at retail soon enough.', 'The villain missions are just one of the many diversions in Trap Team, but the bigger story here is the return of Skystones. The collectible card game is one of the best parts of 2012s Skylanders Giants, but is annoying absent in Swap Force. Now its back in a more satisfying head-to-head design that plays more like Magic: The Gathering than Tic-Tac-Toe. There are far more, and far more interesting, tactical decisions to be made during a Trap Team match than there were in Giants as you match attack and defense values and special abilities against their opponents cards.', 'Trap Teams new lock puzzles are also much improved over those in Giants. Instead of the straight switches and paths, these puzzles return to the board-twisting mechanics from before. This time around, there are bumpers, breakable blocks, fire and water tiles, one-way doors, and other challenging elements that make the puzzles so much more satisfying and interesting.', 'Sadly, not all the diversions are quite as successful. The platforming sequences are very shallow but their bigger fault is that many of the jump pads just arent built for co-op. The jump pads send characters flying off, but unless they hit the pad together, the game will try to teleport one character to the other. The problem is that it often does it in the middle of the jump, which creates even further separation between the characters and creates a sort of teleporting, jumping loop that it can take a few seconds to break.', 'And the less said about the rap battles, the better.']",IGN

Impressively, Bayonetta 2 just gets better from there. With the style, grace, and precision of a runway model, she sashays, punches, poses, and kicks her way through an outstanding 10-hour campaign full of grand setpieces and deadly angels and demons."", ""Building on the original Bayonettas strengths, Bayonetta's 2 free-flowing combat remains its greatest asset. Each punch, kick, and weapon swing flows comfortably into the next empowering move. Everything moves at a fast and fluid 60 frames-per-second target (it never noticeably dipped), and this sequel feels supercharged thanks to excellent animation, more opportunities to cancel out of attacks mid-move to dodge, and fun new weapons to unlock, like the Rakshasa blades or the Chernabog scythe. Each feels distinct and has its own branching combos that can be mixed and matched to set up different styles of play."", ""Executing combos feels natural, and it's invigorating to pull off long attack strings on a group of enemies. Perfectly timed dodges have a tangible reward thanks to Witch Time, a slow-motion payoff for dodging at the last second that allows me to dig in and devastate angelic foes. Once I factored in the new Umbran Climax - a high-power release of demon-summoning attacks that strike in a wide radius - I had plenty of ways to embarrass the opposition. No matter how large they got (and Bayonetta 2s enemies get enormous) my attacks could still send them reeling."", 'Bayonettas not overpowered, though. Even on normal difficulty, the enemies shouldnt be underestimated. The dozens of enemy types, from the small flying underlings to the large bosses themselves, have distinct attack patterns and signature tells that demand and reward your attention. Each boss has a cool and unique visual design, and no two behave the same way. The flying boss Valor, whose gold armor gives him the look of an angelic knight, fights much differently than the deadly Urbane, a ground-based foe that wields dual flaming gauntlets.  The constant enemy variety makes me feel like Im never fighting the same foe for too long or too often.', 'Action gets chaotic, but big, colorful effects help make it clear whats going on at any given moment: successful last-second dodges set off purple-hued slow-motion moments, while Angelic minions, with the sculptured look of mythic statues, have a shimmering gold effect that signals theyre winding up to attack. Clear visual language like this informs quick decisions, letting me confidently dodge and strike enemies down with a high-powered offense.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBayonetta 2 Expert Gameplay Showcase\n06:49\n\n\n\n\n\n\n', '', 'The meticulous rating system gave me incentive to aim higher and experiment with new combos and moves. Each chapter rates you based on time played and combo prowess, with penalties to your score for items or continues used. It pushes you to do better with great rewards like score multipliers and extra currency to spend on new techniques, accessories, hilarious Nintendo-themed costumes, and items.', ""Many elements of Bayonetta 2's presentation and mechanics are geared for hardcore action fans, but it attempts to embrace casual newcomers too  with mixed results. The GamePad-focused touch control option uses simple taps, holds, and swipes to send an A.I.-driven Bayonetta into attack. That alternate control scheme is a neat addition, but it doesnt hold up well with lots of enemies on screen because the camera has trouble keeping up. Youll have to learn the standard control scheme a few hours in regardless - and you should, because its fantastic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBayonetta 2: The Feel of Fun\n10:03\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"", '', 'Theres also an online only, scenario-based co-op mode that squeezes a little more value out of Bayonetta 2s excellent combat. Each one is acquired by completing sections of the main campaign, and they distill combat to smaller area encounters with a group of enemies or even bosses. Theyre fun, but its all over after just two- or three-minute bursts of action.', ""As a finishing touch, Bayonetta's wicked weaves -- transformations involving powerful demonic accomplishes -- punctuate the end of an action sequence, often skewering enemies in outrageous death traps. They create some of the most extravagant moments, with gruesome enemy-munching sequences. Mashing buttons as a Godzilla-sized demon is turned in into devilish lunchmeat for one of Bayonettas minions is a satisfying conclusion after a tense fight. \n"", ""But as much as I enjoy Bayonetta's over-the-top style, and Im not too put off by her hypersexualized character design, the writing does have a bad habit of occasionally slipping into annoyingly juvenile territory with some bad attempts at humor. I dont mind some juvenile humor to complement a light-hearted action game, but the jokes just lean on foul-mouthed punchlines and silly character tropes, and the sequences go on for way longer than they should."", 'On the other hand, the writing has some good high points, like how it positions The Masked Lumen Sage as an excellent foil to Bayonetta. The times I fought him felt tense, as he firmly stood toe-to-toe with my heroines high-powered abilities, summoning his own angelic helpers to counter my own. \n', 'The excellent combat of Bayonetta 2 is boosted by superb art direction and pacing, both of which make Bayonetta 1 look poor by comparison. Missions never lets up, presenting more enemy types to fight across urban cityscapes, quaint mountain cities, and stylized interpretations of Heaven and Hell. Level designs give you room to take advantage of Bayonettas shapeshifting abilities, so you can charge through a platforming area as a panther or swim through underwater sections as a sea serpent. Its also useful in combat as well. By double-tapping the dodge button I can quickly transform and close the space between opponents I fight on the ground, in the air, and underwater.', '\n']",IGN
185,Sherlock Holmes: Crimes & Punishments,30-Sep-14,Chuck Osborn,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/30/sherlock-holmes-crimes-and-punishments-review,"['As far as games go, famed detective Sherlock Holmes has never looked or played better than he does in Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments. The latest in developer Frogwares adventure series uses Unreal Engine 3 for a much-needed graphics upgrade. The more disappointing news is that Holmes final deductions are based largely on a web of circumstantial evidence.', 'Crimes and Punishments takes place over the course of six perplexing, well-written cases that give Holmes ample opportunities to do what Holmes does best: Snoop around crime scenes for clues, interrogate suspects, and talk down to just about everyone he meets. Murder is afoot in each of the cases, but that doesnt stop them from being diverse; from a gruesome death by whaling harpoon to an Egyptian-style ritual killing, the plots had me riveted. And like a good winding mystery, the person who did it is rarely the one you suspect initially.', 'My one criticism about the structure of these cases is that theyre all standalone stories, with nothing really linking them together except for the involvement of Holmes and his trusty chronicler, Dr. Watson. Holmes brother Mycroft, a British government official, shows up early on to foreshadow the concluding case, but otherwise the anthology just...ends. No overarching mystery, no grand denouement.', 'Controlling Holmes from a third- or first-person perspective, discovering clues by searching crime scenes for evidence and questioning suspects is pretty easy and straightforward. Objects of interest are clearly marked by floating text boxes; some may require activating Holmes detective vision (similar to Batmans in the Arkham series) which uncovers secrets that would go unnoticed by lesser sleuths. Its a bit limited, since there are no secret areas or unlockables to uncover  but on the bright side, because detective vision didnt need to be activated unless I was prompted to do so I didnt waste time hunting for hidden clues that werent there.', 'Some clues will require further research, such as consulting an archive of old newspapers and encyclopedias, while others may need to be tested in Holmes lab. Testing and picking locks present mini-puzzles that range from dreadfully easy to brutally difficult. A plus is that overly challenging puzzles can be skipped without penalty.', 'While its easy to find clues, making the right sense of them can be another matter. Clues can be combined to make deductions, leading to the final deduction of the murderers identity. The problem here is that each case has more than one possible conclusion -- with only one being the correct one. Since many deductions are based on very circumstantial evidence (a rope was tied with a sailors knot, so a sailor must have been present!), theres rarely a proverbial smoking gun that clearly points toward any one suspect. Like a game of Clue, several possible outcomes are plausible, but only the final conclusion screen reveals whether the right call was made. Luckily you can go back and replay the conclusion until you make the right selection...IF youre able to combine the clues in the right way.', 'Conclusions also come with a moral choice: Should the suspect be arrested or absolved of their crime? From what I could see, theres no reason for this feature to exist except to slightly alter the final cutscene; it doesnt change the gameplay for future cases or alter how people interact with Holmes. Its a mildly interesting inclusion, and I hope its fleshed out more in future installments, but the morality system is wasted here.', 'Brief and, in relation to the rest of the gameplay, unexpected action sequences punctuate the climax of each case. Unfortunately, these sequences cannot be replayed; if a suspect commits suicide before you can shoot the gun from their hand, theyre dead permanently -- no backsies. On the plus side, these sequences showcase Sherlocks boxing skills and Watsons marksmanship, while also giving each story an extra rush of adrenaline and finality.', 'What really sets Crimes and Punishments apart from its predecessors, though, is its sparkling new look. Its gorgeous on PS4 and PC; every character is rendered in rich detail -- so much so that you can see individual stubble and facial blemishes. Its one of the most beautiful adventures Ive played. Likewise, the voice acting is well done and pitch-perfect to Crimes style and time period.']",IGN

In that version, its not unusual to find Mr. Incredible riding the Muppet mobile around Cinderellas castle firing a toilet-paper gun. The core playsets, meanwhile, are great in a different way - they expose kids to a variety of gameplay experiences, from hack-and-slash combat to naval warfare, skateboarding, and stealth.', 'For Disney Infinity 2.0, I expected a major advancement in gameplay on top of the addition of Marvels mightiest heroes to the party. The name certainly implies it. But while it brings some smart improvements and Toy Box mode continues to evolve and impress, elsewhere this sorta-sequel feels more like a downgrade.', '\n', 'Nowhere is this felt more keenly than in the story mode. The starter pack contains a single play set (a self-contained, structured adventure) based on The Avengers, and physical toys of Iron Man, Thor, and Black Widow. The toys look great  Infinitys style continues to do a brilliant job of unifying all of its characters. But when I stopped playing with them and went to play with their in-game counterparts,I quickly missed the variety of having three distinct worlds, each with their own mechanics, to explore. Infinity 1.0 bundled Pirates of the Caribbean, Monsters University, and The Incredibles all into the starter pack, so 2.0s starting point is noticeably less than expected. Marvels Universe is unquestionably rich enough to compensate, yet The Avengers set disappoints  its small, bland, and repetitive. On the bright side, the one advantage of having a single set is it allows co-operative play without the need to buy any additional toys.', 'The plot centres on Loki invading Manhattan, unleashing an army of Frost Giants hellbent on bringing about a new ice age. And while the city certainly feels cold and lifeless, it has absolutely nothing to do with the ice slowly encrusting Stark Tower.', 'Finishing the campaign took me somewhere between four and five hours, yet it felt much longer  not in a good way. Manhattan is such an integral part of Marvels universe, yet here it feels badly served. Parts of the city are off-limits  you cant fly through Central Park, for example  and I couldnt find the Baxter Building or the Daily Bugle. It never feels like Marvels Manhattan.

Variety manifests solely in the number and size of enemies you encounter; sometimes they have shields, sometimes spears, and now and then, if youre lucky, you have to destroy weather machines or protect generators at the same time.', 'The original Infinity sets encourage exploration by hiding new building items and collectibles, which would then rollover into creation mode, just out of reach. I also remember customising Jack Sparrows ship and rigging a variety of traps around Monster Universitys campus. Those playful elements, which a year ago I thought central to the Disney Infinity experience, have mysteriously evaporated.', '\n', 'This is all the more frustrating since improvements have definitely been made to the characters and combat. Each character now possess a skill tree that allows players to unlock new abilities, so you can specialize them in ranged attacks, melee, healing, or speed.

It adds variety but also helps make these characters feel more distinctive.', 'Combat is another area that has received a lot of attention. Theres way more variety and the potential for real depth is present: characters possess counters, moves designed to break down an opponents defense, and special moves. But it never has the opportunity to shine; the control scheme just isnt appropriate, as most of it is mapped to a single button, and theres an absence of worthy, intelligent adversaries to unleash it upon. Even the climactic battle with Loki himself is indistinguishable from earlier encounters.', 'But play sets are just one part of the Disney Infinity experience. Toy Box, where everything you collect and all your toys exist side-by-side, is a huge attraction. And strangely, its where Infinity really embraces the Marvel license with an enthusiasm thats never evident in the play set. You can decorate your worlds with easter eggs and loads of Marvel paraphernalia; theres everything from the Infinity Gauntlet to the Book of Vishanti. Having hundreds of items available to build with is always going to present problems, yet a redesigned interface and the ability to favourite particular items make building much more fluid.', '\n', 'Its also much easier to get started in Toy Box than it is in 1.0. Theres a whole range of new tools which will randomly generate everything from terrain to cities and even race tracks. Tiny helpers can be tasked with building themed areas, such as pirate towns or tree houses.', 'However, at the more complex end of Infinitys creation suite are the Creativi-Toys  a series of logic gates that allow, in theory, more sophisticated experiences to be built. The number and variety of these has increased, yet the interactive tutorial has vanished. I found it really difficult to get to grips with these tools, and often found myself resorting to trial and error.', 'Thankfully, the originals eagerness to embrace different genres finds a home here in the form of Toy Box games  these are physical tokens, two of which come in the starter pack. Escape from the Kyln is a top-down Gauntlet-like adventure, while Assault on Asgard is an introduction to Tower Defense. Its great this aspect of Disney Infinity lives on somewhere, but I would have loved to have seen these games directly inform the play set. I dont want kids growing up thinking that all single-player campaigns involve escort missions, mindless button-mashing, and Frost Giants.', 'Toy Box is still the place where Disney Infinity really shines. Its where youll find Thor and Mike Wazowski can racing horses across the desert and Mickey Mouse and Iron Man paintballing in Halloween Town.']",IGN

With an art style that's somewhere between Tim Burton and South Park, it's at once eerie and sweet, and one look at its protagonist is enough to set the tone. Baby is a cute little girl, all dark curls and big eyes  and upside-down face, voice like scratchy violin strings, and leering grin full of crooked teeth. But even if her mouth isn't in the right place, her heart is; all she wants is to find her missing mommy, and she's willing to cross miles of faintly unsettling hellscape to find her. Her search is achingly adorable, beautifully animated, and filled with memorably clever puzzles  but just like being around actual little kids, it can be more annoying than fun."", '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', ""That's partly because you don't control Baby directly; you lead her, taking her by the hand (by holding a finger on the touch screen) and pulling her forward. It's a cool idea, except that continually holding a finger on the screen gets tedious, and if you pull her along too far or too fast, she'll trip and fall. She's also not the only thing you have to worry about. Her heart-shaped balloon is what's really in peril; lose it or let it pop, and you'll be booted back to the last checkpoint. To keep it safe, you'll need to use another finger to maneuver it out of the way of thorns, swat down safety-pin-shaped bugs (by tapping them), and move objects like umbrellas to deflect falling dangers. Nearly all interaction happens through the Vita's touch surfaces (there doesn't even seem to be a way to pause, short of hitting the Home button), so just performing basic moves while holding the device can take some deft finger gymnastics. And that's if the balloon doesn't inexplicably slip out of your grasp at a crucial moment, or Baby doesn't suddenly start ignoring your input. At least the checkpoints are forgiving."", ""Using the rear touchpad is more consistently enjoyable. As Baby makes her way through four themed level sets (which take around two or three hours to toddle through), she'll find other balloons that, when popped, give you the ability to change the level's background and theme by swiping across the back of the Vita. Each background has a cool special ability, activated with a tap; early on, you'll find one that bursts open several jack-in-the-boxes, scaring your enemies (and Baby, who then has to be quickly reunited with her balloon). Later, you'll be able to shrink Baby, temporarily turn her balloon to stone, summon a massive creature to cause path-clearing earthquakes, or flip the level upside-down, among other abilities."", ""Despite their seeming simplicity, these powers are fun to experiment with, and more versatile than they at first appear. It won't be long before you'll find yourself using multiple abilities in quick succession, flipping the screen to get Baby onto a platform that can only be moved with lightning, then flipping your Vita again to tug her quickly across a rapidly dissolving walkway. The puzzles are never particularly difficult or obtuse, but some of them can be pretty demanding, requiring quick thinking and snap decisions to pull Baby through alive."", ""The backgrounds can also adversely affect Baby's mood, however; one reveals hidden platforms and walkways, for example, but its ominously stark black-and-white palette makes Baby afraid to move, meaning you'll have to put extra effort into nudging her forward. Even seemingly benign backgrounds can make Baby noticeably uneasy, so sometimes, the most useful backgrounds are the ones that don't do anything except put her at ease and make her more cooperative."", 'In spite of the hazards, disturbing visuals, and generally creepy tone, Murasaki Baby isn\'t nearly as dark as it looks. Baby\'s rarely at risk of direct harm, and she\'ll usually stop and cower at danger until you clear it away, rather than charging haplessly into it. And while most of the obstacles in front of her are the work of other, similarly misshapen children  whose stories and behavior make them just as weirdly relatable as Baby  ""defeating"" them is really a matter of solving their problems and turning them into friends. This might involve a puzzle-centric boss fight, a few electric shocks, or a deep freeze, but everyone\'s alive and happy in the end, giving Murasaki Baby a much sunnier outlook than similar-but-deadlier fare like Limbo.']",IGN

I think that easier for you to fight if I do the support. I had two possible replies: So what it is now is better, and Right, thats a great help. I chose the latter response, to which Klein replied, Its impossible now, but Ill take care of supporting. Well, ok then.', 'This jarring translation is emblematic of Sword Art Online: Hollow Fragments myriad problems. Its rife with issues like fuzzy directions, shameless fan pandering, and a fragmented story. Thats a shame, because if you took a machete to all that tangled mess, Sword Art Online would be a solid action RPG.', 'The combat is hands-down the best part of Sword Art Online, and the one thing that kept me moving forward when things got rough.  Theres an impressive number of weapon and skill based abilities to choose from, and being able to decide when and how I used them ensured combat never got stale or repetitive. I also liked being able to access my favorite attacks by hotkeying them to the Vitas face buttons, since it allowed me to change battle tactics on the fly, which was super useful against tough enemies.', 'Giving orders to my A.I. companion during battle was fun too, since I could team up with them to unleash a fury of chain attacks. For example, while fighting a three-headed dragon, I quickly switched places with the swordsman Klein to have him draw the enemys aggro while I ran behind it and dealt out a devastating 27-hit combo using my dual blades. I then ordered Klein to follow up with his own sword attack, while I used a weapon skill to buff my stats and dole out even more punishment.', 'When I wasnt fighting monsters, I was running around beaches and forests looking for rare loot and tougher-than-normal monsters to challenge. Each section of Sword Art Online is impressively large, and although that sometimes meant traversing long and difficult roads to complete a mission, it also meant plenty of opportunities to stumble upon hidden treasure. I could also explore certain areas with multiple A.I. companions or other players via ad-hoc, which was a nice addition since it made SAO feel more like a real MMORPG.', '\n\n', '', 'If the entire game was just battle and exploration, I could give SAO a thumbs up and call it a day. Alas, these elements are overshadowed by confusing sides missions, a tangled plot, and awful characters.', 'Take Hollow Missions. These optional, story-based sidequests should have been loads of fun since they offer challenging enemies and plenty of exploration. Instead, I found them to be a major pain due to the incredibly vague instructions that came with them. For example, during an early Hollow Mission, I was told to  go find where the dragons are. Thats a real line of dialogue, and the only bit of instruction I received for my quest. Go where? Do what? How? I had no clue.', '\n\n', '', 'I also found myself confused by the story. Hollow Fragment starts after the first arc of the anime, but then veers away from the shows plot completely to create an alternate storyline that combines the plot of the Japan-only Sword Art Online: Infinite Moment with a new campaign made exclusively for Hollow Fragment. This strange tangle of story events combined with the terrible English translation made it really difficult for me to follow what was going on.', 'Then theres the horribly juvenile romance system, which is nothing more than shameless fan pandering.  Make no mistake: this is not Personas celebrated Social Links or the clever Romance System in Fire Emblem: Awakening. There are no deep or rewarding relationships--platonic or otherwise-- in Sword Art Online. Its just a bunch of anime girls running around in bath towels whining that Kirito doesnt pay enough attention to them.', '\n\n', '', 'Unfortunately, if I wanted to unlock any of the girls battle skills I had to interact with them. This was always painful, since I was forced to sit through some really terrible dialogue. (Please stroke my head, one girl asks when conversing with her.)  Even when trying to avoid certain girls like the underaged Silicia or Kiritos creepy cousin Leafa, I was still forced to endure the occasional end-of-level cutscene with them. It was an annoying intrusion that made me dread going on story-based missions lest I be exposed to some embarrassing moment between Kirito and his many girlfriends.']",IGN

""How much,"" I asked, ""do I have to pay for a version with normal 2D maps?""', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', ""Planetary Annihilation's biggest problem is one of usability - and not the manageable one that comes along with being a spiritual successor to Total Annihilation and Supreme Commander, which are both large-scale real-time strategy games with complex economies. Planetary Annihilation never solves the central challenge of its main conceit: how do you make an intuitive, graceful RTS interface for a game that's not contained on one map? The result is a game that always left me feeling like I was wrestling with an overloaded shopping cart with a wobbly wheel, even after I'd learned how to play it reasonably well."", 'Everything plays out via a rate-based economy, and scales up from a single Commander unit to vast armies of several hundred units by harvesting resources and building factories. Marrying supply to demand is the key to success here, and the challenge of managing it at the same time as your battle plans is intense and rewarding, and having to protect your Commander from assassination keeps you on your toes. Its exactly the Total Annihilation formula, and its a great place to start.', ""But then you start zooming out, and begin to realize that while you're able to see more territory, the curvature of these tiny globes means that you can still only see a fraction of the playing surface before you have to spin the camera to another position over the planet. It's a fog-of-war you can never dispel; even when you have radar coverage of an entire planet, your situational awareness is severely reduced."", ""Those big problems would be enough to make Planetary Annihilation a flawed-but-fun experiment. What sinks it, tragically, is the lack of care and attention shown to the details and player aids. For starters, theres little in-game help, and what's there is worse than nothing. I launched the tutorial to see what I was missing, and was treated to a low-res YouTube video that seemed more like a pitch for Planetary Annihilation than a guide to playing it. Note to developers: Googling unofficial Planetary Annihilation wikis to learn the basics of your games controls is not an appropriate substitute for a manual, and promo videos explaining the rudiments of RTS games are not substitutes for a tutorial."", 'To Planetary Annihilation\'s credit, the ""picture-in-picture"" option makes it easier to juggle two things at once, and does a great job of giving multi-monitor advantages to single-monitor users. On the other hand, it\'s not as good as actual multi-monitor support, a feature thats desperately needed but does not seem to be supported. In fact, I think my preferred setup for play would be one of those banks of security camera monitors - maybe then I could see all the angles I need to..', ""Even more unforgivable is the lack of a save option, either in single-player skirmish or in multiplayer. (Theres no single-player campaign.) This is a big game and, like a lot of its predecessors, things can drag on for more than an hour as up to eight sides bash away at each other. Yet Planetary Annihilation gives you no option to save your skirmish or multiplayer game to pick it up later. That's a shocking oversight, as is the fact that you must be online to play even a single-player skirmish."", 'On the other hand, it\'s in keeping with a general ""half-baked"" quality that pervades Planetary Annihilation. There\'s no faction design, just different skins for the all-important Commander units who lead identical armies of robots and tanks. Maybe faction design matters slightly less in this style of RTS, where mass production and weight of numbers carries the day over individual unit tactics, but the lack of variety is still disappointing.', 'Even the good ideas end up going to waste. Planetary Annihilation has a promising ""Galactic War"" mode in which you lead your faction from system to system, headhunting other commanders, unlocking new techs, and conquering territory. Trouble is, it\'s paper-thin and once again badly executed.', 'The ""strategic"" layer is no such thing. Your choice of where to go and who to fight is entirely meaningless. It is effectively solitaire. Second, you only have access to a fraction of the tech tree. You have to expand your options by exploring the galaxy as your conquer it, and choosing which techs to keep and which to permanently discard.', ""That's a nifty idea, except that it's so restrictive as to be annoying after a little while. For instance, in one mission I ended up stuck on two planets, but I was tech-locked out of the orbital combat units I needed to clear the space above my AI adversary's final stronghold. My unarmed transports were swarmed by his orbital interceptors every time, and I could never establish a foothold. So I had no choice but to build a battery of 14 nuclear missile launchers and just spam the planet until, by blind luck, I nailed his Commander. It was a 100-minute match, and 40 minutes of that was just waiting for missiles to finish. I guess I could have built giant engines to smash one heavenly body into another, but only on certain maps that have crashable asteroids  and that wouldve taken even longer. Besides, I don't think I had that technology, either."", ""Sadly, that was one of the better solo games in Galactic War. The AI doesn't seem to know what to make of the limited build options, and rarely put up a fight. Too often, I'd find the enemy Commander just running around the wilderness, waiting to get mugged. In a skirmish, the AI held its own, but the Galactic War adversary seemed to have trouble building a factory. It's just no fun playing such an opponent, so what could have been a gentle, easy way to learn to play turns into a slog from one star system to another."", ""But the biggest problem with Planetary Annihilation is that it's nowhere near as good as the games its consciously aping. Total Annihilation, made all the way back in 1997, is still better than this game. Either of the Supreme Commander games (and especially Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance) leaves Planetary Annihilation in the dust, and they're a whole lot cheaper. There is simply no reason to play this game when those others are still better in every respect.""]",IGN
190,Wasteland 2,23-Sep-14,Leif Johnson,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/23/wasteland-2-review,"['Post-apocalyptic stories usually agree on one thing: technological progress in such dire straits tends to slow to a glacial crawl. The heroes prowl about the wastes with tech that should have been outdated decades ago, and they refashion it to meet the needs of their generation and pray that it holds up. Wasteland 2 is a little like that. Perhaps intentionally, it looks like a relic of the RPG glory days that coincided with the Clinton administration and the popularity of the Spice Girls, and it clings to traditions that seem quaint in these days of big budgets and accessibility. But much like its dusty survivors, Wasteland 2 finds strength in cherishing the past. It even manages to highlight a few ways in which the old ways of the isometric, turn-based roleplaying games really were better after all.', '\n', ""A surprisingly competent live-action cutscene introduces us to a band of grizzly-bearded biker types and hard-eyed women. Our heroes are the Desert Rangers; they're not The Avengers. They're imperfect and flawed, and much of the following story gains its momentum from the surrounding populaces' unwillingness to trust them after past failings."", 'That flashy cutscene is one of Wasteland 2\'s few nods to the sensibilities of the modern era. Everything afterwards reveals an old-fashioned drive to make you work for your satisfaction. For example, it disavows heavy voice acting for quests in favor of reams of text. If youre in a hurry, youll see only the highlighted key words and objectives you need to complete your mission. However, I liked how it rewarded my taking the time and attention to read carefully with not just a considerable dose of dark humor and descriptive depth, but also  a wealth of choices that depend on the passive skills of your party members. It\'s a world where a character with the ""hard ass"" trait can usually bully necessary items out of wary townsfolk without a fight. Thanks to good writing, it\'s a world that often feels real. On the other hand, much as in Divinity: Original Sin, Wasteland 2\'s quest objectives are often frustratingly unclear, and I did run into the occasional bug that impeded my quest progress if I deviated from what must have been the proper sequence of events.', 'What voice work there is in Wasteland 2 is wisely put to effective use. A memorable early quest forces you to choose to save either the inhabitants of Hightown or the Ag Center, for instance, and you\'ll have to listen to the tragic fate of the town you didn\'t choose over the radio. The voice work in such cases is uncommonly good; in fact, it\'s rather disturbing. It\'s also just a preamble to the stuff you\'ll hear once your group advances to places filled with the oh-so-proper factions like the ""Mannerites"" in California, and they help to emphasize that your choices have meaning and that there\'s a world that exists beyond the immediate action in front of you. Something always needs doing, and there\'s always a sense that you\'ve let somebody down in this harsh landscape. When the 50-hour journey is over, these choices are whats most memorable about Wasteland 2.', '\n', ""Another way inXile's RPG distinguishes itself is in its welcome break from most modern games by placing the emphasis on an initial four-person team instead of an individual hero. You can start with pre-made characters with role-suggestive names like Big Bert and Pills, but they lack the rich personalities of the supporting cast in a game like Dragon Age: Origins, and their skills occasionally overlap. You're thus better served by creating your own party. Even then, you'll find yourself limited; the tiny number of points available for the daunting number of skill trees means you'll always have to forgo some skill that might make a particular encounter simpler or entirely avoidable. The design complements the harsh world that surrounds them, yes, but at times developer inXile seems to go to excessive lengths to give characters with every skill something to do. Way too many chests are rigged with explosives, for instance, which means that every time you encounter one you'll have to switch to your teammate with Perception to see if it's safe. It becomes a bit of a predictable chore."", ""Wasteland 2 does better with player-specific skills once the business of combat starts. It's turn-based, most directly in the tradition of the old Fallout games (which were spiritual successors  of the original 1988 Wasteland). A handy tutorial ensures it's easy to pick up for younger RPG fans who weren't around when this type of game enjoyed its heyday. In keeping with the setting, ammo is scarce and the rustbucket armaments you're toting have an almost comical tendency to jam and suck up action points in the process of repairing them, which means it's best to have each party member specialized in a different set of weaponry. It means guns, while powerful, usually aren't as reliable as good, old-fashioned beatin' sticks, and a well-placed thwack will often excel where assault rifles fail."", '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', 'Advertisement', ""Gaps in your partys skill sheets would be a huge handicap, but inXile wisely allows you to fill in the blanks with additional companions you'll pick up along the 50-hour journey. Be forewarned, though, that they're prone to ditching you, turning on you, or attacking other NPCs out of turn if they're not fond of some of your decisions. That's usually not a problem, but the roster of roughly 15 available companions is so meager that each death from a party member that goes rogue almost certainly necessitates a reload (You can't save in combat, which I do appreciate from an anti-cheating standpoint, but it does make it tough)."", ""It's a decent system that makes most fights interesting and liable to change fortunes in an instant, but playing in long stretches made me fall into a predictable routine that dangerously teeters toward monotony. If you can't sweet talk or growl your way out of trouble, you'll always have to fight. The strategy involved rarely gets more complicated than ducking behind crates that are prone to explosions and simple destruction more often than not, and the lottery of pleasing long-distance gun kills versus ill-timed jams and point-blank misses never reaches the satisfaction so recently found in Divinity: Original Sin's flamboyant magic shows."", '\n', ""Likewise, if pretty graphics are what you're after, that's the CRPG to play. Put bluntly, Wasteland 2 looks like it was designed sometime after the release of Fallout 2 in 1998 and then given a modernization treatment similar to what Overhaul Games recently did for Baldur's Gate. Even Wastelands overworld maps here seem deficient in that regard; you're limited to dragging a Desert Rangers badge across a bleak landscape punctuated only by green clouds of fallout."", ""But slick, modern looks clearly aren't a priority for inXile, and to its credit, its strengths are such that they never feel necessary. Wasteland creator Brian Fargo and his new studio set out to make a CRPG that could stand as a true heir to the Wasteland of 26 years ago and the two Fallout games that followed, and in that regard it succeeds. If you're looking to scratch a 26-year itch, few games do it better.""]",IGN

This all-action spin-off ditches the traditional dungeons and puzzles in favor of big, Dynasty Warriors-style battles, but the layers of Zelda fanservice managed to keep my attention for its 10-hour adventure."", 'Aside from its basic but entertainingly indulgent story that ties three Zelda games together with an interdimensional crossover, Hyrule Warriors is all about fighting. The process of killing your way through enemy armies is mostly simple and repetitive, but what keeps it from getting too boring too fast are devastating special attacks that launch enemies into the air. This was especially fun whenever a lot of enemies would appear on screen. Its genuinely satisfying to make them fly and watch the number of simultaneous KOs flash on screen.', '\n', 'It should be noted that few enemies on these vast battlefields ever stood toe-to-toe with me for more than a few seconds. But as with the Dynasty Warriors games, thats the point: You play the role of a hero with the power to single-handedly turn the tide of a conflict between lesser soldiers. It genuinely feels great to be stronger than 80 percent of the enemies on screen, and to watch the battle change based on which skirmishes you choose to fight. Whether capturing enemy bases or fighting tougher mid-bosses, I always felt like there was something I needed to do or needed to slay, even if the actual act of slaying is pretty much the same time and time again.', 'The other big thing Hyrule Warriors has going for it is a diverse playable roster of 13 familiar Zelda characters including Link, Princess Zelda, Ganondorf, and more. Each  has unique weapons and abilities - a heavy-hitter like Ocarina of Times Darunia swings a mighty hammer to crush foes on the field; Sheik, on the other hand, uses a mix of quick strikes and a harp with elemental properties. Unlocking and switching between characters keeps the action interesting a little longer.', 'Some surprising depth materializes out of the crafting system, but you have to dig for it a little. By replaying stages and farming materials, I could build useful equipment to augment character combos, weapons, and special abilities as the in game Bazaar. Creating special badges makes a character more resilient. You can also synthesize cool new weapons at the Smithy and carry over handy traits that add strength or magic properties. Its handy that you can spend rupees to level up weaker characters, because I felt encouraged to experiment without needing to grind each one for experience.', '\n', 'Boss monsters are the main area of Hyrule Warriors fan-service-fueled trip that doesnt translate well to the Dynasty Warriors framework. They do offer an impressive bit of scale, and in keeping with the Zelda series, each boss has an exploitable weakness. But these oversized foes feel like weak homages to their Zelda inspiration. In the Legend of Zelda series, a big part of the epic boss fight design is their smartly laid out maps, which require some situational awareness. The battle against King Dodongo in Ocarina of Time, for example, takes place in a closed-off chamber with a pool of lava in the center, forcing you to use a narrow dry path to avoid getting run over by the beast or fried by the lava. Dropped into the wide-open battlefields of Hyrule Warriors, Dodongo and the other bosses come across as generic damage sponges.', 'Overall, Hyrule Warriors just isnt much of a challenge, and even turning up the difficulty doesnt do anything for it. On higher settings, the average mini-boss just inflicts more damage and requires double the hits to vanquish, but doesnt change up his attack pattern. It becomes a monotonous chore to finish one off.', '\n', 'After I completed the campaign, I got a few more hours of entertainment out of the clever Adventure mode, which repurposes a detailed recreation of the original Legend of Zeldas map for a clever item hunt. Most of the secrets littered throughout this 8-bit map all tie to existing ones from the NES original game, so I had to reach back to my memories of the original game to find them (a handy compass will unveil secrets if you cant remember). Using items like bombs or candle flames unlocks a cool new prize, and claimed by engaging in a standard Hyrule Warriors battle on that tile. Since completing missions in either mode will unlock more secret weapons, characters, and styles of combat to enjoy, it gave me a good reason to stick with Hyrule Warriors a little longer.', 'However,  the local-only multiplayer mode is a huge disappointment because of very noticeable performance problems. Extending a second players perspective to the GamePad means the resolution takes an awful hit, creating jaggy visuals that would look at home on Wii. Even so, things intermittently slow down a lot when lots of enemies join the mix.']",IGN
192,Frozen Synapse Prime,30-Sep-14,Scott Butterworth,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/30/frozen-synapse-prime-review,"['Planning a turn in Frozen Synapse Prime provides the same inexplicable joy of meticulously setting dominoes on end, only to watch them topple in a fraction of the time it took to arrange them. Aside from its ability to reliably accommodate a staggering array of tactics, Primes greatest asset is the glorious tension of that moment when you bite your nails, flick the first domino, and wonder, Is this actually going to work? That consistent satisfaction makes this one of the Vitas most rewarding games, and perhaps the single best tactics game on the platform, period.', 'Primes top-down, simultaneous turn-based action pits two teams of micromanaged soldiers against one another in five-second bursts. You independently outline your squad members actions step by granular step with empowering precision, and once every strafe and corner check has been finetuned using the handy dry-run preview tool, you prime the turn and watch as your preset actions play out against your opponents in real time. Was my shotgunner fast enough to make it past that window before the enemy sniper got into position? Did he turn left, as I predicted, or did he turn right? Well, youre about to find out!', 'Because you never quite know what your opponent will do next, every turn becomes a psychological duel  the winner, ultimately, is the player who can be more devious, who can cover all the angles, who can outflank and out think his opponent. In essence, its the perfect antidote for all those mindless run-and-gun shooters, relying entirely on tactics and a unique brand of predictive puzzle-solving rather than twitchy trigger fingers.', 'Whats amazing is how fair Prime is. Since soldiers simply follow commands, kills are determined by a number of factors: stance, cover, line of sight, range, weapon type, and more. Constantly trying to account for every factor while inputting commands occasionally made me long for the simplicity of chess. I also spent some early hours fighting with the combat interface, especially when trying to arrange a particularly complex series of commands. You can place and adjust waypoints, set multiple actions at each waypoint, and control the timing down to the split-second -- the level of nuance possible is absolutely daunting.', 'But that nuance is also what makes Prime such an amazing tactical sim. Once I overcame that brutal teething period (and learned the subtle but crucial differences between the Aim, Sweep, and Check commands), I quickly began to appreciate the deep well of tactics it afforded me. Instead wondering why the hell that stupid AI shotgunner killed my soldier even though my guy was already aiming the right direction, I was able to focus entirely on anticipating my opponents moves and embracing the thrill of a calculated risk. Importantly, this was all possible because Primes combat proved so consistent. After learning the ins and outs, I was rarely puzzled by an outcome. Either I screwed up or I won; it didnt feel arbitrary.', 'Not only are the mechanics thoughtful and engaging, Prime actually gives you plenty of ways to use them. Theres a full, story-driven single-player campaign that, depending on your play style, could easily devour a dozen hours. The dystopian cyberpunk narrative teeters on the edge of trite and often feels a bit scattered, but does eventually pay off, especially if youre willing to read the expository text dumps between missions.', 'Beyond the story, the campaign excels at providing new and unpredictable scenarios to test your skills, made all the more unpredictable by the modular, semi-randomly generated battlefields. One mission gave me a trio of shotgunners and tasked me with defeating five snipers positioned on the opposite side of the board, which proved...tricky. Inventive scenarios like that, though occasionally frustrating, kept the experience as a whole fresh and surprising.', 'As solid as the campaign and its AI enemies may be, the real stars of Prime are its multiplayer modes. This game is tailor-made for head-to-head competition, and thankfully, it gives every tool you could possibly need to orchestrate intense battles, including deeply customizable maps and match parameters, six different match types, and even a replay theater.', 'But the coolest part? Prime lets you play multiple matches at once in an asynchronous fashion. Opponent taking forever to finish setting his turn? Simply back out to the multiplayer menu, where you can easily track all your matches, and jump directly into the ones that require your attention. Its smooth, intuitive, and helps combat turn-based multiplayers most common problem, though it still cant eliminate it entirely. I often struggled to find opponents and endured many matches that became inactive almost immediately. Thats not really Primes fault, but it is the reality of situation currently.', 'Relative to the original PC version of Frozen Synapse, Prime enjoys a total visual overhaul complete with 3D modeling and added killcams (though the new gray palette is actually a bit dull). Primes controls mix both physical buttons and expertly implemented touch controls, which should make it easy to get comfortable. And the added tutorials help take the edge off the learning curve.']",IGN
193,Endless Legend,23-Sep-14,Rowan Kaiser,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/23/endless-legend-review,"['Endless Legend is lush. Simply put, its one of the best-looking turn-based strategy games Ive ever seen. The graphical style is both dense and pleasantly abstract, from the closest zoom, to the full-map view. Its science-fantasy setting has a pleasant amount of lore, both magical and futuristic. As an overall experience its fantastic, though its bookended by a cluttered tech tree and some apparent early-game imbalances.', 'This is a Civilization-style turn-based grand strategy game, where you build cities, explore a map, meet rivals, engage in diplomacy, and achieve some form of military, technological, or diplomatic victory, although its not a direct clone and puts its own spin on those game mechanics--which can be initially confusing. Also, like its fellow fantasy grand strategy games, like Fallen Enchantress or Age Of Wonders, Endless Legend includes hero units who grow stronger, and tactical combat--the former is fairly perfunctory, but the latter is quite fascinating. Still, what sets Endless Legend apart from its peers is its overall tone and the entire experience of playing it, instead of any one specific game mechanic.', 'Endless Legends setting grabbed my attention immediately. It draws its science-fiction elements from developer Amplitudes previous game, Endless Space, but mixes in a huge dose of fantasy as well. There are eight factions, including the elf-like Wildwalkers, who come into conflict with groups like the Vaulters, whose goal is a return to spacefaring. The combination of these two styles -the science fantasy aspect - shows up in factions like the Broken Lords, a group of noble futuristic vampire-like beings who subsist on what everyone else uses as currency, instead of using food.', 'Endless Legend does well in adhering to Civilization V-style design of factions, where each one is distinct enough to encourage entirely different play styles in each new campaign. For example, technologically-inclined and Warhammer-ish Vaulter faction has a scientific and industrial bonus, heavily-armored troops, and the ability to pick a holy resource that grants even greater bonuses. Theyre a relatively versatile faction compared to the Roving Clans, whose generic name belies their specific gameplay rules. The Roving Clans are the merchants of Auriga, and so receive bonuses to their moneymaking and diplomacy, and the roving part of their background means that they alone can move their cities around their provinces and also have armies filled with cavalry. But this comes at a cost: the Roving Clans cannot declare war, preventing the more aggressive playstyles.', 'Ultimately though, Its the look and feel that makes Endless Legend seem so special. It takes visual inspiration from the Game Of Thrones intro, most clearly in that when you build or expand your cities they rise from the ground, piece by piece. Zooming the strategic view out to a certain point fades the details away, turning the screen into an abstract, brown-paper map. Its an effect thats been done before, but Endless Legend makes it look especially good, maintaining a continuity of abstraction and information regardless of the level of detail.', 'Gaps between cities are filled with both interesting terrain and various resources to exploit. Each map is divided into provinces, and each province has its own terrain styleice, high plains, dark forests, deserts, etc. This level of detail and variety makes Endless Legend stand in stark contrast to Endless Space, which suffered from being far too sparse.', 'Those visual flourishes also make it easy to spot the tactical value of an area. Hills are represented as raised steps instead of smoother bumps, which calls attention to the importance of topography for decision-making in combat -- you can put archers on impassable cliffs to fire down on enemies. Instead of seeming in any way realistic, Endless Legend instead  makes me feel like a powerful lord, making decisions on a strategic map in my council chambers, pushing little wooden troops around.', 'In perhaps the cleverest touch, combat works in exactly this fashion, on this map, instead of breaking battle out into its own screen. Theres still a combat mode, and stacks of armies, but when forces bump into one another they begin tactical combat on the world map itself. Fantasy-themed strategy games have often been bogged down by detached, time-consuming tactical combat modes, but this reconnects the tactical combat to the campaign setting. Battles never get too time-consuming either, because all players give their orders to all units at the start of the combat phase, and theres a limit of only six phases per fight.', 'All of this lends Endless Legend an amazing harmony between its rarely seen setting, its lush aesthetic style, its map, and its strategic and tactical decision-making processes. Just sitting and playing it is a wonderful experience overall, in a way that reminds of some of my favorite game worlds of all time, like Ultima VII, World of Warcraft, and Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning. To add to the overall experience, the music is both lovely and thematically appropriate, especially the faction music that plays at the start of each campaign.', 'Big-picture strategic depth is Endless Legends potentially weakest point, unfortunately. I dont mean to suggest that its a poor strategy game - its not - but my first weeks worth of games has yet to really gel in several ways. Its density extends into the endgame decision-making, where having too many decisions, as opposed to fewer, more interesting ones hampered my sense of progress.', 'For example, Endless Legends technology system isnt a straightforward tree, like Civilization - and it shouldnt be, because this isnt known Earth history. Instead, its divided into eras which are filled with a dozen or so technologies. Research enough from the previous era, and you can start on the next. The catch is that the previous eras technologies are still there, available to research. So what ends up happening is that the overall number of technologies available just gets bigger and bigger, which makes the later sections of Endless Legend feel muddled. Im also less than thrilled with the hero customization process, which also offers a bunch of different choices that struggle to make themselves feel important.', 'Another problem I have with Endless Legend is that even relative to other games of this type, success seems to hinge far too much on getting a great set of resources to put your first city next to, and building cheap armies to pull off early rushes. It seems like too powerful of an option, leading to quickly aborted games, or having to hold back a little to get a good long game going.', 'Those issues aside, Endless Legend possesses many of the mechanics of its fellow grand strategy games, and generally does them well. For example, each hex on the map clearly shows what resources are available for a nearby city, so you have to pick your placement carefully, just like Civ. But unlike Civ, you build specific buildings to expand the citys reach, which damage both local and overall happiness. There are also benefits to both expanding the city as far as possible to get more resources, while consolidating it levels it up and grants its own improvements; the entire process is filled with good strategic balances.']",IGN
194,Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS,26-Sep-14,Jose Otero,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/26/super-smash-bros-for-nintendo-3ds-review,"['Great news! The first handheld installment of the excellent Super Smash Bros. series lives up to incredibly high standards. Like its console siblings, Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS elegantly packages decades of Nintendos best video game mascots into a pick-up-and-play portable game. But the real surprise here is the diverse modes of play thatve kept me playing feverishly for days.', 'Smash 3DS builds a fast and fun four-player brawler out of prolific video game characters and universes. Each one uses the same inputs to activate their unique moves, so once youve learned one, you can play all 48 of them. Winning is about knowing the right time to use Marios fireball, which is different from Marths Dancing Blade, in effort to knock everyone else out of the ring with a perfectly timed Smash attack.', 'Characters, stages, items, and assist trophies pull inspiration from a diverse selection of games and showcase lots tiny details that highlight each ones special qualities.', 'From the start, the variety of the 36-character roster impressed me, and 12 more fighters are unlocked over time. Newcomers like Robin from Fire Emblem Awakening, Rosalina & Luma from Super Mario Galaxy, Little Mac from Punch Out!!!, and more join the battle alongside mainstays like Mario, Link, Pikachu, and Samus. Even non-Nintendo characters like Pac-Man and Mega Man are embraced with genuine reverence to their source material.', 'Wii Fit Trainer is a great example of the humor: This silly callout to the massively popular Wii Fit series transforms the peaceful art of Yoga into a fun fighting style. I love how she doles out helpful advice in between all the hits. That same attention to detail in all the characters meant I was constantly finding something new and fun for dozens of hours.', 'All of the action in Smash 3DS moves at a solid 60 frames per second. I noticed that characters appear a little chunkier than their console counterparts, but that has the effect of making them easier to see. A helpful red or blue outline communicates which side youre playing for in Team versus mode, which is a big help in a crazy brawl.', 'However, Nintendo hasnt managed to solve one significant issue when bringing Smash Bros. to the 3DS: Namely, its difficult to keep track of characters whenever the camera zooms out in heated four-player matches. Theyre just too tiny! A targeting box activated via the 3DS touch screen helped a little, but it feels like a band-aid solution for a larger problem. Scaling down to three player free-for-alls makes things much easier to follow, but one-on-one play shows off this handheld version in the best environment possible.', 'What really impresses me about Smash 3DS is the many ways to play, and its many layers of unique customization. Building custom fighters is an easy process, too. It lets you define layers of equipment that affect easy-to-understand parameters of power, defense, and speed. Improving one area decreases the value of another, so I could weigh out several options and settle on the fighter that works for me. Mii Fighter special moves are, thankfully, all unlocked from the start, but custom moves for main roster need to be unlocked.', 'Menus feel a little scattered, but once I learned where everything is, it was easy to jump into solo, local, or online play. I can easily switch up rules before a match, and select from several different stage variations. Theres even a helpful lobby to practice in before a host launches a local match. Online play is carefully separated, so you can jump between ranked matches, smashing with friends, spectating online bouts, or even a custom replay channel where you can watch one character to learn what attack combinations people are using.', 'Of the eight modes Smash 3DS gives you to choose from, I spent a lot of time switching between regular matches, variations of Multi-man Smash, and online one-vs-one play the most. All-Star mode took me through a chronological history of Smash Bros. that started in the early 80s and ended in 2013. Classic mode resembles the single-player mode in GameCubes Smash Melee, but with a twist: I could choose my next challenge on a map and pick up trophies and gold to unlock even more stuff.', 'Sadly, the random nature behind the exclusive 3DS mode, called Smash Run, make it the one part of Smash 3DS I had trouble enjoying. The core idea itself is a gluttonous stat grab where you have to spend five minutes at a time collecting power ups that increase speed, jump, attack, special, arms, and defense to prepare for a final battle or a randomized competition like a race. The AI enemies in Smash Runs generic sprawling area are unrelenting, which is fine, but the randomly selected final match could be something Im completely unprepared for because I didnt have the right stats needed to win that type of challenge. Being the slowest runner in a race just isnt fun. If Smash Run leveraged some insight into the final fight, it could be a lot more memorable than what it currently is.']",IGN
195,FIFA 15,23-Sep-14,Chris Schilling,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/23/fifa-15-ps4xbox-one-review,"[""A single moment can say a great deal about a games design philosophy. For me, that moment came in a game between me (as Man City) and the CPU (as Chelsea). Pablo Zabaleta won the ball with a crunching challenge on Eden Hazard; the Belgian hit the deck, with Zabaleta about to stride onto the loose ball, and into acres of space. Meanwhile, his fellow Argentine Sergio Aguero, anticipating an unfolding counter-attack, accelerated into a sprint. But instead of running forward as I squeezed the right trigger, Zabaleta suddenly held both hands up, as if to say 'no foul'. By the time the player responded to my prompt, Nemanja Matic had seized upon the opportunity, intercepting the ball and launching another Chelsea sortie.\n"", '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', 'Old Trafford', 'Britannia Stadium', 'Emirates Exterior', 'Ethiad Exterior', 'Advertisement', 'Goodison Park', 'King Power Stadium', 'Liberty Stadium', 'Loftus Road', 'Selhurst Park', 'Advertisement', 'Stadium of Light', 'St James Park', ""St Mary's Stadium"", 'Villa Park', 'White Hart Lane', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'Its an example of FIFA 15s much-touted emotional intelligence, a feature designed to make each player respond authentically to any given scenario. Yet emotions tend to overrule the rational part of our brains, and the same applies here; what it ultimately means for FIFA is that youll see players make more mistakes under pressure. In theory, its a fine idea, but the execution is problematic, because to compensate for human error, EA Sports has made them less fallible elsewhere. The result is that AI behaviour oscillates between smart and stupid.', 'Nowhere is this more apparent than with goalkeepers. Theyve been noticeably refined, and for the most part this turns them into truly great shot-stoppers. Theyll now react to deviations in the balls flight path, twisting their bodies in mid-air when it takes a deflection off a lunging defenders knee, jabbing out a leg to turn aside a shot that seems to be squirming past them, and sticking out gloves to palm aside rebounds on the rare occasions the ball falls kindly to your striker. (Its more common to see a parry picked up by an AI forward, of course.) Unlike last years game, you wont see them hurl themselves full length to the right of their goal as the ball trickles into the bottom left-hand corner. This is undoubtedly a good thing.\n', 'But on the other hand, theyre often comically panicky in goalmouth scrambles, and alarmingly prone to letting daisy-cutters through their legs. During a thumping early win with my Ultimate Team, I nutmegged the keeper for four of my goals. In another game, I saw Joe Hart suddenly sprint out of his goalmouth as if called forward for an injury-time corner. Which would have been fair enough, but the ball was still in play at the time, and I was 3-0 up. Soon to be 3-1 up.', 'In fairness, glitches like this in a game that bravely attempts to accurately simulate the extraordinarily complicated physical and behavioural variables of a sport are to be expected, and its to FIFAs credit that theyre relatively infrequent. And in the main, goalkeepers are  as they should be  hard to beat, yet still fallible. Its thrilling to break an opponents back line, only for your rasping, top-corner drive to be thwarted by a fingertip save, bringing howls of anguish from the noisy crowd.', 'Penetrating that defensive barrier can be quite a challenge at times, not least because opponents seem more ready than ever to put their bodies on the line. Blocked shots are a common occurrence, and even nippy forwards and wingers like Sturridge, Robben and Navas will struggle to accelerate clear of the last man, as lumbering defenders suddenly find a superhuman burst of speed to catch up with players they shouldnt be able to get near. I get some joy by running into the channels and cutting inside, or back onto your other foot, particularly with flair players: long, mazy dribbles are now easier than ever, and players with low centres of gravity will skip over the outstretched boots of their markers, retaining the ball even as their shirts are being tugged.\n', 'This does mean that anyone who favours a crossing game may be disappointed. In the demo I scored far too many volleyed goals from long, arcing balls into the box, but thats not the case in the finished game - though theres an apparent sweet spot if you manage to double-up on one side. A short pass to a wing-back or wide midfielder and a first-time cross will finds a strikers head more often than a regular cut-back from the byline. Im slightly wary of suggesting finesse shots  and, to a lesser extent, flair shots - are overpowered, lest EA Sports nerf them too aggressively with another patch. But its true that in a one-on-one, squeezing the left trigger or right bumper as you let fly does give you a significant advantage.', 'When youre commanding one of Europes top sides in particular, maintaining possession in FIFA 15 is a joy. Slaloming past challenges as Carlos Tevez, say, is a rare treat, and when youve got the ball youll feel in almost total control. When you lose it, however, its another matter. That invisible bubble around attackers is harder to break than ever, not least because sliding challenges are more easily anticipated by players shifting their weight  one of the strengths of my defensive game is now a clear weakness - while minor infractions are more frequently punished.', 'It doesnt help that player positioning is bafflingly poor at times. Youll give the ball away because an overlapping wing-back simply didnt make the obvious run; even when you telegraph a pass into space, theyll inexplicably fail to anticipate your plan. And whichever formation you choose, theres often a huge gap in the middle of the park, frequently exploited by the AI in FIFAs most egregious piece of scripting: defensive clearances. Should an opposing side head or hack the ball away, the chances of it bypassing your entire midfield and landing at the feet of their forwards is astonishingly high.\n', 'Its akin to that classic uncanny valley effect  you cant help but notice these issues all the more because FIFA gets everything else so right. The animation is sublime, while dribbling and turning is more gratifyingly responsive this year, and overall theres a more palpably organic feel to each game: the loose balls, the interceptions, the deflections all make it more unpredictable and thus more satisfying.', 'Thats when it lets you play, because this year it feels like EA Sports has built a game thats often keener for you to watch. Cutaways intrude more frequently than ever, and youll have to wait several seconds in each instance before youre allowed to skip them. When the ball goes out of play, youre often reminded of a recent goal or incident by a replay, and while theyre often beautifully framed, after a while it feels like an indulgence, a way of inviting you to marvel at the way dirt and grass stain players shirts, or the evident wear and tear on the pitch.', 'Though these interstitials should, perhaps, be optional, some players will relish a second viewing of a blistering strike. And the role of presentational tweaks shouldnt be easily dismissed. The wealth of cosmetic changes during gameplay all contribute to the big-match feel, and helps you become more invested in the outcome of a game. If youre a fan of a mid- to lower-table Premier League team in particular, the novelty of seeing the stands youve likely sat in and cheered your side on from, as well as hearing the chants of your fellow supporters, will take some time to wear off.', 'There are welcome adjustments elsewhere, too. The addition of loan players to Ultimate Team gives you the opportunity to briefly employ a galactico to give your team a temporary boost, though itll bite a significant chunk out of your in-game funds that might be more wisely invested elsewhere. Better, perhaps to employ a former great who hasnt lost their eye for goal: I got some good early mileage out of Diego Milito, for example. Its now much easier to tailor your tactics according to who youre playing, too  whichever game mode you choose, you can create and customise multiple team sheets to quickly switch between, rather than having to adjust your setup before every game. Meanwhile, the Match Day Live hub strengthens the growing ties between the game and the sport, giving fans the latest news updates and stats about their favourite team.\n', 'Increasingly, FIFA seems more interested in simulating a TV broadcast of a match rather than the beautiful game itself. In some cases, thats not necessarily a bad thing: theres something special about Martin Tyler reading out the team sheets and highlighting your teams setup in the early stages of a match, while the recorded snippets of commentary are stitched together more seamlessly than ever.', 'And yet even here there are problems: Tyler cant resist an opportunity to discuss how a player performed in the World Cup of 2014, while Alan Smith seems obsessed with where exactly the ball hit the back of the net. The desire to feed back to the player, to demonstrate that its aware of whats happening in both the game and the real sport, only serves to remind you that youre not listening to two human beings converse. No commentary team would talk like this during a real-life match.', 'Its moments like this that highlight one of the biggest problems with annualised sports franchises: FIFA 15 is so keen to show what its doing differently, that its changes are more in service of the feature list on the back of the box than the quality of the simulation itself. My celebratory response to a last-minute Sebastian Giovinco volley which finally broke a stubborn Sassuolo rearguard action (their Park The Bus strategy proving frustratingly efficient) is testament to how FIFA can stir passions like almost no other game. But even with some sensible investments this season, its a little way short of its best form.']",IGN
196,Theatrhythm Final Fantasy: Curtain Call,12-Sep-14,Meghan Sullivan,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/12/theatrhythm-final-fantasy-curtain-call-review,"['I might have been a bit obsessed during my time with Theatrhythm Final Fantasy: Curtain Call. If I wasnt playing it, I was thinking about it. If I wasnt thinking about it, I was humming one of its 221 songs (or so Ive been told). Its an extremely enjoyable hybrid of role-playing and rhythm-based action, and although the plot is paper-thin and some of the features a bit superfluous, I never stopped smiling while watching cute little sprites battle adorable monsters to the beat of my favorite Final Fantasy songs.', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', 'Theatrhythm Curtain Call Images', 'Theatrhythm Curtain Call Images', 'Theatrhythm Curtain Call Images', 'Theatrhythm Curtain Call Images', 'Advertisement', 'Theatrhythm Curtain Call Images', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'Like its predecessor, Curtain Call is a celebration of over two decades worth of Final Fantasy music. As a huge fan of composers like Nobuo Uematsu, Hitoshi Sakimoto, and Masashi Hamauzu, it was a joy to hear tunes like Rebel Army (Final Fantasy II)  and Unavoidable Battle (Final Fantasy: Tactics) alongside more contemporary pieces like Defiers of Fate (Final Fantasy XIII). Curtain Call also includes songs not previously released for the original Theathrythm (though some were later released as DLC). My favorite additions include tracks from Final Fantasy titles such as Type-0, Tactics, and Final Fantasy XIV, but there are also new songs from titles like Mystic Quest and Lightning Returns.', 'I have to applaud developer Indies Zero for their ambition. With so many songs piled into one compilation, I assumed there would be some type of noticeable audio compression or a drop in sound quality. Yet from what I can tell, every single song in Curtain Call has maintained its integrity. Richly orchestrated pieces like Final Fantasy XIVs  On Westerly Winds sound just as good as simpler tunes like FFVIIs Gold Saucer.', 'If my favorite thing about Curtain Call is the music, than my next favorite thing is the different ways in which I got to experience the music. It was fun tapping and sliding my stylus around the screen as cute little Final Fantasy sprites fought enemies in Battle Music Stage, connected song waves in Field Music Stage, and chased patterns of light while a music video played during Event Music Stage. The gameplay isnt all that different from the original Theatrhythm, but new songs and visuals kept things fresh and interesting.', 'I also enjoyed the Quest Medley Mode, which let my merry band of spiky-haired heroes traverse a colorful map filled with different types of music stages and difficulty levels. It was fun being able to sample all these different types of gameplay in one mode, and I liked earning treasure and experience points by challenging a boss at the end of each quest.', 'The only thing that disappointed me was the lack of a some type of little story to go with these missions, since without extra story content to set it apart the plot isnt all that different from its predecessors: a group of warriors must gather Rhythmia (experience points) in order to banish a being named Chaos and return light to the world. Still, I enjoyed going on these randomly generated quests. I never knew what type of music stages awaited me, and it was fun testing my skills against tough enemies or completing a stage by navigating an airship.', 'If Im happy with Quest Medley Mode, Im somewhat indifferent to Versus Mode. I admit its fun going head-to-head with a friend to see who could score the most points in the same song, and I like the idea of racing to see who will be the first to unleash special attacks (known as EX Bursts) onto their opponent. It just felt a little repetitive after awhile, and some of the EX Burst skills (like one where notes randomly speed up and slow down) were slightly annoying.', 'Another (very) small complaint I have is that Curtain Call never takes full advantage of its RPG roots. Dont get me wrong: I spent more than my fair share of time putting my favorite Final Fantasy characters together in different kinds of parties, equipping them with abilities like Omnislash and Firaga, and combining collectible cards in the new CollectaCard Crystarium to power up their stats. The breadth and depth of all this customization is impressive, but it never really seemed to make a difference in terms of gameplay.  So long as I had a good sense of rhythm and fast reflexes, I never needed to worry about seeing the Game Over screen. In fact, the only time my party ever got wiped out was when I played on Ultimate Mode, the hardest difficulty setting. Trying to master songs like Final Fantasy IVs Battle With the Four Fiends was a serious test of my eye-hand coordination, and I was thrilled when I finally managed to get through it.']",IGN

At the start, its an amiable action-adventure with a cute gimmick. Instead of a sword, you have... well, its still a sword, but a sword with a USB connector that lets you hit monsters, blocks, and a few other things and play around with their variables. How far a block moves when pushed. Whether an NPC is friendly or not. Setting a guard to do negative damage so that he furiously heals you with every hit. Coupled with its funny script and charming retro aesthetic, all the pieces are in place for a clever little pastiche of adventuring that does for coding what Gunpoint did for security-system rewiring.', '\n\n', '', 'Its a comedy game, but when it comes to weaponizing variables and debug code, its dead, dead serious. Just for starters, its probably the first game ever made to boast about how easily you can crash it, whether its by setting a generator to spill out turtles until your computer melts, or tweaking a script to the point that its universe collapses. Where most action RPGs give you tools to use against your enemies, Hack NSlash gives you increasingly more powerful ones to use against itself and full permission to do so - including a handy time-rewinder resetting any damage, though not always flawlessly. More than once a room took a couple of resets or a full game restart to clear the scripts.', 'While to some extent the toys you get to play with are best kept as surprises, its scope can safely be explained like this: In the first Act, you twiddle with variables and play with a couple of jokey devices, such as an orb that undoes the variable that makes a friendly character remember shes already given you something. In the third, the puzzles involve working directly with Lua code, albeit via menus instead of by typing.', 'Despite the name, Hack NSlash offers very little slashing, and its not the RPG it looks like either. Its really a puzzle game, where the puzzles demand your hacking abilities rather than the hacking being a way to cleverly subvert them. The villain can do the same stuff that you can, and the toys that let you do it are all made for that purpose by his enemies - a magic loupe, for instance, allowing you to physically step into game code. It is however every bit as smart as it looks, and as charming, with developer Double Fine mixing up a cocktail of geekery devices, Adventure Time-style banter, and amusing characters like big-bad Christof and his habit of gratuitously teleporting like Ganon in the old Legend of Zelda cartoon.', '\n\n', '', 'Somewhat frustrating, though, is that for all the very smart, ambitious, and never-before-tried stuff that Hack NSlash does so well, it has a tendency to drop the ball on the easy stuff. Its maps are a nuisance to get around, with slippery controls, and little thought seems to have gone into the fact that no player knows a game as well as its designer. It can be a question of not knowing about an item that you dont have yet, or that youre now meant to backtrack despite the fact that a particular chest remains shut, or that a particular puzzle isnt ready to be solved yet. A map called The Infinite Woods, for instance, is introduced almost immediately, but its not for another chapter that you have the item you need to navigate it. Solving puzzles is fun, but splashing around trying to figure out whats next and whats just a dead end really, really isnt.', 'More annoyingly though, it can often make solving them far more time-consuming than it needs to be, even if the basic concept is relatively simple. One early on simply involves adjusting the offset on four rotating circular barriers to clear a path for a boomerang. The four ports, though, each involve a trip on a floating platform from which the barriers are half off-screen, require a trip on a floating platform to reach, and are a real pain to synchronise. Its added annoyance, not added difficulty, especially with your hackers tendency to fall off the platform for no reason - one of many minor but irritating map issues, from the perspective making it harder than it should be to navigate, to how cluttered the screen quickly gets.', '\n\n', '', 'For the most part, the actual puzzles are satisfying to solve; the smartness of Hack N Slash meaning that you feel extra smart for having solved them, even if it was a relatively simple gate to unlock or swapping an operand to reverse somethings function. When it comes to the programming ones specifically though, things are hampered by not using simple text, but visual abstractions of programming code that involve things like coloured gemstones shooting coloured dots at terminals (theres no apparent colour blindness mode, by the way) wired up to produce a result.', 'In an early example, one generates a bridge, but only four blocks of it. The solution (slight spoiler, obviously) is to go in, change the value that controls the number of blocks to 10 or so, and then activate its switch. Easy. The complexity soon ramps up though, including code rooms having functions that force you into other sub-rooms to make further changes, running around to manually hit blocks and swap out operands and values and piece together functions, and generally make the whole thing more time consuming and less intuitive than just working with the damn code directly would be.', '\n\n', '', 'If you know programming, its frustrating to deal with all this. If you dont, this is not a good teacher; for many players, Act 4 will be less a challenge than a brick wall coated in titanium. It doesnt help that what explanations there are quickly get buried in jokes, that theres nothing to do except sit in empty caves until you finally get it, and Hack N Slash offers little but quips and sympathy if youre stuck.', 'Provided that you dont mind the lack of hints, though, its an interesting experience helped by the fact that the main character isnt a programmer. He too is trying to work through the problem by experimenting and poking and prodding rather than simply giving up early. It does feel like it could either have used a little more or a little less abstraction in the name of clarity. Either would be fine, but the current balance isnt right.']",IGN
198,Dance Central Spotlight,24-Sep-14,Miranda Sanchez,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/24/dance-central-spotlight-review,"['As I raised my hand to initiate the count for OneRepublics Counting Stars, my cat pounced on my ankles and attacked my feet. I dont blame her; my dance skills are awful. However, Dance Central Spotlight helped me become a little less awful. Hundreds of dance moves and smooth difficulty progression make Dance Central Spotlight a fun way to learn new dance techniques and work out. However, it does miss out on features from past Dance Central games, giving it a stripped down feel by comparison.', 'Dance Central Spotlight brings the dance series down to its bare bones. Unlike its predecessors, it doesnt include a story mode or competitive multiplayer. Whats more, if youre looking for a bit of variety in your music, youre going to have to buy it because the 10 pre-loaded songs are limited to recent Top 40 hits, such as Happy by Pharrell Williams and Diamonds by Rihanna. In essence, at $10 USD for the base game, Dance Central Spotlight functions as a platform within which you create your own experience through DLC. Theres currently 50 songs available for $2 USD each, or a few dollars more for certain song packs.', 'Despite that though, I never felt short-changed. Each of the 10 songs has eight routines -- Beginner, Standard, Deluxe, Pro, Alternate, Cardio, Strength, and Alternate Pro -- so theres still a lot of content to get through. Each song starts you off with the Beginner routine, but once you collect enough dance cards by earning a Flawless rating on dance moves, youll begin to unlock the other routines. Dance Central Spotlight doesnt have a fail state, so having the collection barrier feels like an appropriate way to pace players into the more difficult routines. Jumping from Beginner to Standard to Deluxe was smooth, as each difficulty felt like it added just the right number of moves to keep it challenging and entertaining.', 'The practice mode accessed by saying Hey DJ, practice that, or by pressing the Y button is thankfully still available. In this mode, you can practice a specific dance move at its normal speed or slow it down. It helped me on several occasions when I needed to nail down complicated moves to unlock the next routine. The Xbox Ones Kinect tracks your movements down to a tee, so precision in your moves is key, which is great. I couldnt be lazy and slack through songs if I wanted to collect enough cards to move on. Instead, I had to really learn each move, which not only made me a better dancer, but also helped prepare me for the more challenging routines ahead.', 'The Fitness mode in Dance Central Spotlight sees the most improvements over past games. Instead of building up a playlist of songs, you choose how long youd like to dance -- sometime between 10 and 90 minutes -- and then you can select which kinds of routines youd like perform. Once started, the mode picks random songs from your library and alternates between showing the time of your workout and your estimated calories burned. With the new Cardio and Strength routines, I felt like I got the most out of my time in the Fitness mode since their dance moves are specialized for working out.', 'Not only does Dance Central Spotlight lack competitive multiplayer, but it actually reduces the number of local co-op players from Dance Central 3s eight back down to two. That doesnt keep it from being fun though. To start a co-op game, players have to high-five -- what better way to get pumped for a routine than to start your game with a high-five? Jumping in and out of co-op is totally seamless too. If a player leaves or re-enters the Kinects field of vision, the song will just keep going while the camera focuses accordingly, all without interrupting the routine. This improved co-op functionality is great, but its a shame that Dance Central Spotlight doesnt capitalize on this with a new online mode or by at least maintaining multiplayer features from past games.']",IGN
199,Minimum,19-Sep-14,Dave Rudden,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/19/minimum-review,"['If you printed out the chat logs from most matches in the attractively low-detail multiplayer shooter Minimum, one comment would stick out amongst the standard stock of gg, LOL, and pwnd: Sword noob.', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', ""While there were, of course, utterances of this game is fun and that's an awesome weapon and the rare mention of strategy, sword noobs were a common thread. As fun as it is to face waves of dinosaurs and take down big stompy robotic titans, and as surprisingly as the simplistic low-detail design works in Minimums favor, the imbalanced melee gameplay makes creates more than minimal frustration.."", ""Provided you can find a full five-on-five match without too many sword-wielding psychos, all three of Minimums modes are a blast. Theres a standard team deathmatch with some good-sized maps, a horde mode that pits you against unique creatures and foes in samurai and ninja costumes, and Titan Mode, which mixes elements of MOBAs, Minecraft, and Titanfall into Minimum's greatest selling point."", ""Between farming creeps (weak, AI-controlled enemies) for power-ups for your Titan, unleashing your firepower on the other side's Titan when the two meet midway through the map, then pressing the advantage if the other Titan falls first or falling back to defend your base if yours goes down, Titan Mode requires you wear many hats as the flow of the match progresses."", ""Again, though, balance is the biggest fly in Minimums ointment. You see, every player on the battlefield has a regenerating health pool (though true to Minimum's name, its not shown on screen). While you can do some damage with various sniper rifles, plasma launchers, or bouncing-bullet miniguns, generally the distance between you and your opponent means theres often time to retreat, take cover, and heal up when youre in trouble.. When it comes to the swords, though, getting close is as close to a fail-safe tactic as there can be in Minimum. Short of having super-precise aim with a shotgun, you'll usually be felled with three or four rapid strikes from a sword - even before its been powered up with the in-match progression system -  Swordsmen even get increased agility, making it quick to close the gap with a gun-wielding target and to escape if things get hairy. Once you die, of course, you'll drop various collectibles, including power-ups that make your opponent's weapons stronger."", ""While that leads to the rich getting richer in terms of offense, one could argue that it would be fair if this were all about gunplay; fighting smarter or as a better teammate would be a viable option, though not one that makes Minimum instantly approachable. When you're up against opponents with powered-up double swords, anything short of double- or triple-teaming your foes is suicide unless youre a godly FPS player."", ""At the start of your Minimum multi-player only career, swords can be a deterrent to trying out Deathmatch or even Titan mode (swinging wildly in a pit of creeps is effective in both killing the creatures as well as stopping anyone else from collecting the Titan's power-ups). As you level up, you'll be matched up against foes equipped with even deadlier blades; for as much the launchers and miniguns you can craft can deal more damage, getting swords that deal more damage from the outset or even sap your life to give to opponents make any path but the sword noob tough to take, since you'll be desperately craving the weapon- and armor-crafting materials gained through slaying opponents and earning victories. It's a shame that it's almost a requirement to dedicate one of your two primary weapon slots to a sword, since they rule the roost in Deathmatch and can make half of Titan mode a big risk. An option to ban blades from PvP battles would be a quick fix for all of this, but that doesn't exist right now."", ""The co-op Horde mode is simultaneously a safe haven, a no-holds-barred playground, and a taste of schadenfreude. If you spam sword attacks, nobody will judge you since every player's fighting towards the same goal. In fact, it's a half-decent tactic early on when the AI opponents are weak. When the rounds roll on, though, the many melee-focused foes exclusive to Horde (like dinosaurs and ninjas) will mow melee spammers down with their numbers as teammates, who have properly set turrets and mines and found good choke points, pick up the slack."", ""Though as you scan Minimum's UI, you'll get the impression that there's plenty on the developer's plate. Despite moving out of Early Access, much of Minimum seems a work in progress. Plenty of crafting categories are blacked out, ranked matches don't seem to be accessible at all, and crashes and drops happen frequently. Developer Human Head shot for the moon with Minimum, but it would be great if the potential-filled launch experience could be a bit more accessible to match the its simple style.""]",IGN

Like Super Meat Boy before it, Rage is all about micro-platforming challenges that test your skills, patience, and sanity. But while it delivers hours of hair-pulling moments, it never quite conjures that same feeling of satisfaction that kept me glued to its inspirations.', 'What Fenix Rage asks of you is relatively simple: use a combination of infinite double-jumps and a quick-dash technique to reach the exit of bite-sized stages. If done correctly, most can be completed in roughly 10 seconds. But of course, correctly usually isnt in the cards.', 'If you touch an enemy, projectile, or specifically marked object, you die - and trust me, youre going to die a lot. The levels quickly become cluttered with anything and everything that wants you dead. Thankfully, like Super Meat Boy, you respawn instantly after death in Fenix Rage, alleviating a bit of the stress from retrying a level dozens of times.', 'While Fenix Rage gets progressively more complicated with the addition puzzle elements like portals to pop through and ice that needs to be melted, none of the levels ever really stuck with me. Even after spending upwards of a hundred lives trying to complete some of them, I couldnt describe the layout of any of them from memory. Challenges in Fenix Rage feel disposable, as opposed to iconic.', 'The core problem with Fenix Rage is that I feel like my success more frequently came from luck than they did from skill. After 10 hours, I never felt like I actually got the precise timing down enough to dash through a narrow pass, or escape a pursuing enemy like I can in Meat Boy or Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels. I always felt a little bit out of control, which made both successes and failures unfold without weight. Finishing a level after dozens of deaths didnt evoke pride, but a sort of annoyed relief. Whenever I die in Dark Souls or Meat Boy, I blame myself. A lot of times after I died in Fenix Rage, I blamed elements of the game.', 'I never found that enigmatic moment of zen that comes in particular games like Super Meat Boy, Super Hexagon, and Flappy Bird. Thats because I never felt like I was 100% in control throughout Fenix Rage. The fact that it has a wider array of mechanics than Meat Boy creates a slew of additional variables. For example, take some of the later boss levels, which bombards you with angry monsters and a bullet-hell-level of projectiles, all within tight confines. Contrast that with the elegant simplicity of Super Meat Boy, and Fenix Rage just doesnt compare.', 'Couple this with chaotic and random elements, such as ghost enemies that continually chase you through walls, but seem to arbitrarily give up pursuit at various moments, and what you have is a platformer with a bit too much chaos.', 'Aesthetically, Fenix Rage appeals in the same colorful way old Flash games would. The distinct color palette clearly identifies what is dangerous (everything) and what isnt (nothing). Sadly, its soundtrack it something else entirely. Its grating, looped chiptune-fueled butt-rock made me actually turn off the music for extended periods of time. Honestly, I dont think thats ever happened before.', 'On the other hand, Fenix Rage is loaded with levels, modifiers, arcade challenges that brutally test you on specific gameplay elements like air-dashing, and unlockable real-life cookie recipes. The latter seems silly, but it added a dose of much-appreciated charm.']",IGN

To both its credit and detriment, Re;Birth1 carries that identity struggle throughout. Sometimes the in-jokes and references are spot on, while others fail to critique and instead repeat old mistakes. What could have been a new start for the series instead becomes a merely average role-playing game that just doesnt fit together completely. Its lighthearted, and sports some fun, giant-anime-weapon battles, but its lack of challenge causes it to grow stale quickly.', 'The best part of the Hyperdimension Neptunia games is inarguably the concept: Four goddesses, each representing a different game system, are waging a Console War against one another in a cutesy, high-octane anime fashion. Following this idea, Re;Birth1 is filled with meta, fourth wall-breaking humor, and a good bit of charming self-awareness. Pretty much every character and party member you encounter along the way fits into some sort of anime or gaming archetype  Neptune, who represents the fourth (imaginary) console, is the high-energy, childlike protagonist, while Iffy is a smart tsundere who can get quite flustered at times  and Re;Birth1 actually does a good job of balancing character versus caricature. That\'s about where ""good balance"" ends, however.', 'One cheeky addition along the same self-aware vein is the remake system, which changes aspects of dungeons like enemy difficulty and the types of items that appear. Its good in theory (insofar as its self-deprecating), but in practice, its not all that fun to go through old dungeons again just to get new items. I didnt think grinding was at all necessary, either, so remaking a dungeon to increase the challenge didnt make a whole lot of sense.', 'Grinding is made unnecessary, by the way, due to the relative ease of combat. Its of the basic turn-based, open-movement variety, and I found it functional, yet underwhelming. The only strategy I really needed was to have my healer heal between attacks and kind of brute force my way through things, though a few harder fights were more satisfying. A partnering system that allows one party member to loan her battle perks to another while staying out of harms way adds another dimension to battle, but its not really necessary, and ultimately, it just made battles easier, not more exciting.', 'The story and dialogue both suffer from the same identity problems that permeate every other aspect of Re;Birth1, being simultaneously irritating and endearing at times. If a monster was clearly too hard for the area, I realized it before the characters sassily pointed it out, and I dont need a dozen mentions of the word tsundere to realize which characters fit the archetype. Again, the ideas were there, but they were either too shallow or too frequent, rendering them moot. But I also found it adorable and loved playing as a group of dorky girls, at least for a while.', '\n\n', '', 'Amazingly, Re;Birth1 passes the Bechdel test, which asks if a fictional work contains at least two named female characters who talk to each other about anything besides a man. The Bechdel test is imperfect though, and it shows here. Most of the girls conversations that arent about a man are about pudding or full of jokes, which is cute and totally fine; however, a good number feature forced, awkward sexual advances between the characters and comments about breasts, which was funny maybe once and quickly grew overplayed. Its intended to satirize the same archetypes the characters are based of off, but it doesnt do the job well.', 'A common philosophy in humor and satire is that it should punch up, not down, meaning its better to make fun of those who enforce the status quo than it is to simply recreate the status quo in an exaggerated way. Re;Birth1 does this in places  theres an enemy called Super Otaku and meta jokes about oversized weapons  but it largely fails, especially with its character designs.', '\n\n', '', 'To reiterate, I didnt dislike the characters at all. But the panty shots and sexually charged conversations arent portrayed in a way that says, We know this is ridiculously excessive and were laughing at ourselves because of it. Its obvious that they are imitating more serious media to make fun of them, but the mockery seems incomplete. Rather than a comment about breast size alone, for example, Id expect a follow-up jab about people who see women as decorations or even a simple Its not my fault, I was drawn this way! That would direct the satire, and therefore criticism, at the source instead of the result and make it, you know, actual satire.']",IGN

It casts us as David Young, a detective investigating the murder of his wife; driven by her final words Look for D and the ability to use certain objects to travel into the past. Can he find the killer? And can he change the past and save his wife? Its a strong set-up for this new episodic series, and I greatly enjoyed this initial chapter, which includes a prologue and two episodes.', 'The three or four hours of gameplay here is enough to lay the groundwork for the intriguing wider story, while also introducing a host of quirky characters and establishing a mystery within the mystery.', 'D4 is a more contained whodunit than Deadly Premonition. Where that game was set in an open-world and was very much a horror experience by way of Twin Peaks, D4 is much more like a locked box: a mystery with few settings, driven by characters and dialogue, with only a handful of quicktime action sequences.', 'With a peculiar design style and aesthetic, D4 is offbeat, obtuse, and charming at best, and horrible to control and crammed with wilfully superfluous elements at worst. And thats kind of the point. D4s vibe is all its own, with an intriguing story that very much lays the groundwork for twists and revelations in future instalments.', 'That story sees Young use his newfound power to jump aboard an airliner just in time to interrogate a man who deals in a dangerous drug thats implicated in his wifes death. He represents his own mystery, as Young knows the plane will be struck by lightning and hell disappear, seemingly into thin air. A host of questions are left unanswered by the end, but theres still enough closure to be satisfying.', '', 'D4 boasts a slick, painterly aesthetic.', 'So how does it play? Well, youre a detective, so you spend most of your time talking to people of interest and thoroughly exploring each location, trying to learn everything you can.', 'You have a couple of control options, but despite being initially designed to be played with Kinect (controller support was added later) Id definitely recommend sticking with a controller. Playing this game with Kinect is like trying to drink a bottle of wine using your hands as a cup, when theres a glass right there. Kinect is just too unreliable, and there are just too many things to interact with. Who wants to spend their entire game sitting upright on the couch with a hand in the air? Its a shame D4 wasnt just designed for a controller from the start though, as its still pretty clunky even when using one.', '', ""The action sequences actually ARE better with Kinect, but there aren't many."", 'Given the gameplay is driven by quick-time action and Heavy Rain-style gestures, and there are no real puzzles to speak of, D4 really does live or die on its characters and personality. Thankfully, it delivers.Young isnt as eccentric a lead as one might expect  no split personality or coffee-grounds fortunetelling here - but he gets more interesting as you tease out details about his past life and relationship with his murdered wife.', 'Elsewhere, we have a cast that runs the gamut from a grizzled law-enforcement officer to a flamboyant fashion designer with a romantic attachment to a mannequin. Perhaps the best characters, however, are the most enigmatic, like Roland Walker, a towering giant in a crisp white suit, medical mask, and perpetually cocked head. He speaks in slow, drawn-out sentences and can only be seen by Young. The Twin Peaks influences most certainly remain.', '', 'Duncan and Sukey play several fun roles within D4.', 'Each episode is essentially linear, but also quite dense. There are secrets to find, reading material to absorb, countless objects to interact with, and numerous sub-cases that open up more conversational options. A great deal of this is tangential at best, but I found it hard to resist the lure of trying to unlock every line of dialogue, find every medal, and observe every interactive item within the world. This last element is a particularly neat inclusion. If you hover the cursor over something before choosing to interact with it, short, often-pithy observations from Young pop up around it, providing further information and injecting humour into moment to moment play.', 'There are other nods to his prowess as a detective, including an alternate vision mode  Batmans Detective Mode, essentially  which lets you see objects and people that can be interacted with, as well as highlighting certain clues. Its a good, quick way to ensure youre not missing anything, and can be recharged by quenching Youngs thirst.', '', ""You'll spend a lot of time observing stuff."", 'A more bizarre inclusion is stamina. Pretty much every object you interact with uses up stamina - whether thats turning on a faucet, opening a door or reading a magazine. Want to top it back up? Eat! Its classic Access Games - a system for the sake of a system! Game director Swery and his team seem to be poking fun at the conventions of gaming: the need to quantify and limit things. Most amusing of all, they ultimately have no real meaning, given youll always have plenty of credits to buy any food and drinks required.', 'You could absolutely say the same thing about the ability to change character outfits, or the medals hidden about the place  theyre an arbitrary treasure hunt, there without context or acknowledgement, because hey, games need collectables, right? Statement or not, in the end I couldnt help but enjoy the superfluous elements  they just add to the oddball texture of D4.', '', 'Pictured: oddball texture.']",IGN
203,Forza Horizon 2,25-Sep-14,Luke Reilly,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/25/forza-horizon-2-review,"['Forza Horizon 2s greatest moments sometimes come under the most unexpected circumstances. The Land Rover Defender isnt exactly known for its speed or sportiness, and Tchaikovsky isnt renowned for his racing game soundtrack contributions, but when Horizon 2 mashes these things together something very, very good happens. Ive played a lot of racing games over the past two-or-so decades. Ive never played one where I was shredding through a vineyard at top speed in an agricultural 4X4 primarily designed to effectively ferry British farmers up wet hills. Certainly not with the 1812 Overture booming from the stereo. Is it slightly absurd? Yes. Is it fun? Absolutely.', '', 'Vineyards, and fences, and cafes. And, well, anywhere really.', 'Forza Horizon 2 rebottles the winning formula established by its predecessor, albeit with a heaped tablespoon of new and improved ingredients. The eclectic roster of 200+ lavishly detailed cars here ranges from cult coupes to hypercars, and its the best line-up in the open-world racing business. Like Horizon before it, they all feel distinct from one another too, thanks to the Forza series familiar, top-quality driving dynamics. As usual, supercars feel crisp and sharp, SUVs feel suitably soggy, and everything seems honed to let you heave your cars into corners with two glorious fistfuls of opposite lock.', 'What developer Playground Games has added, however, is a far richer world thats exponentially denser with rewarding racing and exploration content.', 'The backdrop this time is a slab of land straddling the border of northern Italy and the south of France. Its wish-fulfilment for Forza fans whove spent the last decade watching the hosts of Top Gear cocking about on the Mediterranean coastline every second week.', 'Its a bigger area than Forza Horizons small slice of Colorado, though its not a 1:1 recreation of the region. Its still dwarfed by the likes of Test Drive Unlimiteds life-size Oahu, but theres a lot more to do in it. The airstrip, shipping port, and abandoned freight yard are highlights, each offering drift-friendly, hoon-tuned playgrounds to experiment in between races.', 'These are great places to compulsively rack up your Skill points. These rewards for impressive driving return from the original, although this time theyre integrated far better into the gameplay. Where previously Skills points had a nebulous effect on your popularity, in Horizon 2 they unlock points you can trade for permanent perks like discounts on new cars or a small grace period at the beginning of an online game of Horizon 2s tag mode, Infected. Accumulating huge skill combos in Horizon 2 is a lot of fun and far more satisfying now that theres more reason to do so.', '', 'Nice hog.', 'The games 700-or-so events are also lucrative sources of Skill points, from the highly enjoyable Showcase races to class-based blasts across the countryside. The ability to plough through shrubs, splinter fences, and drive almost anywhere is a big shift in Horizon 2. While many events take place on pre-determined ribbons of road, plenty of Horizon 2s racing is on the rolling fields and through the scattered forests of Tuscany and Provence. The fast and frantic new cross-country races are probably my favourite race types. Low-slung sport cars cope unrealistically well with off-road excursions but its a forgivable concession to reality considering how much fun these races are.', 'Horizon 2s racing is supplemented by plenty of extracurricular activities. The new Bucket List challenges are the best; theyre unique activities to complete in cars parked around the world. Some are a little plain, like a simple speed trap goal, but some are hugely enjoyable, like a stunt challenge around a golf course. Barn Finds are back too, tucked away across the region, and Playground made good on its promise that half of them would be brand new cars for the Forza franchise. If you followed the teams weekly car reveals over the previous months the silhouettes on the Barn Find interface will probably give most of the surprises away, but I still loved uncovering the worn-out, weed-filled wrecks and seeing them restored to showroom condition.', 'One thing I particularly enjoy about Horizon 2 is how youre welcome to completely ignore the car championships the game suggests to you on your way to the Horizon Finale and select your own favourites. Letting us meaningfully progress the game by remaining in the cars we prefer, rather than forcing us into vehicles were not in the mood to race, is great design.', '', 'Because red is always the correct colour.', 'Youre also only ever a button press from being online, too. It works well, syncing your time of day to an online session and seamlessly transitioning you into it. The online racing was steady during testing, and I like that being rewarded for building Skill point combos keeps things worthwhile for those of us who cant always finish first, but the more gentlemanly single-player remains my preferred environment. That, or the fiendishly addictive Rivals component where I can compete with my mates event records asynchronously. I lost an entire late night session trading times back and forth with a friend on just one of Horizon 2s marquee Showcase races.', 'Like Forza Motorsport 5, Forza Horizon 2 uses AI driver profiles from your friends list to populate your career races during single-player, as well as the world itself, removing the need for a generic gallery of trash-talking Euro jocks to function as opponents. Horizon 2 is generally better for it but its still too insistent on having us choose a design to immediately apply to the cars we buy. The result is a cavalcade of clipart-splattered cars cruising down the French Riviera looking far more like the kind of off-brand Hot Wheels youd see lining the pegs at Toys R Us than sexy, six-figure supercars. You can still opt out for your own cars but theres no option to explicitly disable these user designs on opponents, like you can in Forza Motorsport 5, and this irritatingly spoils the games aesthetics somewhat. The cars I want to see in my game are the sleek, unadulterated machines we see utilised in Horizon 2s intro; not gaudy eyesores spackled in ostentatious graphics.', '', ""It'd be great to be able to disable the so-called Drivatar designs."", 'Its kind of a shame too, because virtually everywhere else, Horizon 2 has grown up quite a bit from the first. The menu overlays are more sophisticated, there are no microtransaction options muddying the economy, and Horizons layer of mens lifestyle product promotion has been given the boot. So long, Old Spice US Muscle Mash!', 'The world itself is gorgeous, from the vast fields of red poppies to the scooter-lined streets of Nice. While some of the shadows seem a little choppy, the resolutely locked framerate never wavers and thus delivers a dependable, smooth driving experience.', 'As stunning as Horizon 2 looks during the day, it looks even better at night. All light sources in Horizon 2 are rendered in real-time; headlights slice through the inky blackness and smashing a street lamp realistically darkens areas it was previously bathing in light. From the right vantage points, the soft glow of the fireworks and spinning amusement rides at the Horizon festival can be seen from miles away. Horizon 2s new wet weather effects are easy on the eyes too. I love the way the world is reflected back at us via puddles on the asphalt, although the spray effect on vehicles is more static than Id anticipated; even at speed the droplets dont streak across the windscreen or bonnet.', 'The sound is as good as weve come to expect from the Forza series, with roaring engines and crackling exhaust overrun best enjoyed in any one of Horizon 2s lengthy tunnels. I especially love the pleasing crunch of gravel beneath the tyres, but the tyre noise slider needs to be cranked up to 10 rather than its default setting.']",IGN
204,Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor,25-Sep-14,Dan Stapleton,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/25/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor-review,"['The best thing about playing Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is that it makes me feel over-the-top powerful without sacrificing the fear of defeat. Its got great free-flowing combat and a good-sized, good-looking open world full of Lord of the Rings lore to find, but what makes it special is whats going on in the background: an intriguing hierarchy of enemies that gives every victory and defeat extra meaning.', 'A brief and shocking opening scene sets a dark and brutal tone as Talion, a former Ranger of Gondor, is ritually executed along with his family. Talions spirit is then bound to an amnesiac elf ghost and returned to Middle-earth for vengeance against Saurons forces. Its a story that doesnt make total sense for hardcore Tolkien scholars, but its well-acted. It makes decent use of Gollum, and there are a couple of memorable new characters - particularly Ratbag the comic-relief uruk, who guides you through the process of infiltrating the enemy army.', 'My interest in the plot dwindled toward the end, but it does a fair job of explaining why Talion has such sweet supernatural powers with his sword, dagger, and bow. Much like in the Batman: Arkham games, you can choose to stealthily pick off enemies one at a time, or dive head-first into a brawl with dozens of opponents and beat the crap out of them with a smoothly animated series of attacks and counters. Unlike Batman, of course, Mordors involve great, gory decapitation and stabbing animations, and outside of the scripted story missions, there are few distinctly separated stealth and combat areas. Its enticingly freeform.', 'Acrobatically slaughtering Saurons ugly minions feels as easy as it appears to be for Legolas in Peter Jacksons movies, and its more fun to do than to watch. Sword combat feels pretty much just as good here as brawling does in Batman  which is to say its amazing. Mordors take on building up hit streaks to power up lethal takedowns is a bit more forgiving, in that youre almost never locked into an animation. If you push the counter button, Talion will drop what hes doing and counter instantly. Its extremely responsive. A time-slowing power makes scoring a couple of headshots with the bow easy, whether in stealth or in the heat of battle, though its kept in check by ammo constraints and a limited (but upgradable) supply of time-slowing juice. And even though stealth gameplay is pretty basic, its great to have the option to thin the herd a bit before they know youre there.', 'What really sets the feel of Mordors combat apart from the Batman games is that its really easy to get into trouble, especially early on. If you let the uruks raise the alarm in one of their strongholds, or just happen across a few large wandering groups on the densely populated map, you can quickly become overwhelmed by more enemies than you can hope to handle. Picking out the shield bearers and ax-wielding berserkers who are immune to frontal attacks and killing them first becomes tough to do when youre completely surrounded, and it goes downhill from there. Health doesnt recharge much on its own, and until you can upgrade your health pool, you may find yourself succumbing to death by a thousand pinpricks if you dont retreat.', 'Things got a lot easier a few hours in when Id leveled up and unlocked more of Talions skill tree so that I could build up combos quicker, execute two enemies for the price of one, and even fight mounted on a huge, rancor-like graug who pops uruks into his mouth like jellybeans. It feels powerful, but I still dont feel invincible even with everything nearly maxed out.', 'And whats really cool about Mordor is that whether you win or lose a fight, something interesting happens. If you kill an uruk captain, he drops a rune that can be slotted into one of your weapons for bonuses. Some of them changed the way I played, like the legendary rune that extended the amount of time I have to score another hit before my combo count resets by 10 seconds, and one that made me immune to poison attacks. If any uruk kills you, even if hes a random grunt, he levels up and earns new abilities and some cooler armor. Maybe he gets promoted up the chain of command. Youll definitely run into him again later to settle the score, and hell have a new introduction taunt about his victory when you meet. It makes each death feel meaningful.', 'Most uruk captains do tend to die too quickly to really become memorable, but some definitely did. (Sometimes theyll survive being apparently killed by you and come back with a scarred face.) For that reason, and to identify the arrival of a significant threat, I never really got tired of the action-pausing cutscenes that play when a captain shows up. There are enough different voices and multiple possible lines that I rarely saw repeats, and the uruk faces are surprisingly well animated and expressive.', 'Even though the hierarchy is a pretty simple system when you understand what its doing, and realize that these uruk captains arent actually roaming the map in real time, its great to play with. Uruks have an internal power struggle for rank, and you can interrupt their duels, feasts, hunts, and more to pick fights and kill off Uruk captains and ultimately the powerful Warchiefs. Each captain has his own randomized strengths and vulnerabilities, so every fight is at least a little different. I ran into a couple of guys who seemed invulnerable to almost everything, which was a little annoying  one fight took me about 15 minutes of repeatedly chasing down a captain who was invulnerable to my sword and dagger and filling him with arrows trying to damage him faster than his health regenerated. Eventually, though, they all went down.', 'In the second act, you transition from the bleak, brown map to a refreshingly greener-looking area of Mordor. There, Talion and his elf-ghost buddy suddenly realize he can mind-control uruks and turn them against each other. (It feels like something mightve been cut out there.) Thats even more fun, because the ability to brand an enemy gives you the choice of either killing a captain for a rune reward or controlling him and siccing him on one of his former allies. Taking an uruk alive can be trickier than lopping off his head, though, so its more challenging to accomplish the new goal of mind-controlling five Warchiefs. I love how you have the option to mind-control a Warchiefs lieutenants, then kill the Warchief, to watch your minion become the new Warchief. I did notice that the mind-control visual effect caused some slowdown on the PlayStation 4 version (the Xbox One version has yet to arrive for testing), but it didnt interfere much with combat.', 'Charging through the decent but less-exciting story missions would probably take around 12 hours, but the goal of killing or dominating the Warchiefs is much more time-consuming and interesting. I spent around 25 hours to reach the end, and theres still a lot of challenging side missions based around testing sword, bow, and dagger skills left to do. And, of course, lots of collectables and wildlife-hunting challenges.', '', '6GB? Now THOSE are textures!', 'On the PC side Mordor also compares to the Batman games, in that its of good quality. There are even some enhanced graphics settings, including an ultra-high texture setting that requires a full 6GB of video memory.

True, this is probably the worst-looking of the bunch by a small margin - the PS4 runs at a slightly higher resolution and the PC has better lighting than either (and all the resolution your hardware can handle) - but it performs at roughly the same clip as the PS4 version and provides effectively the same experience. That means what appears to our eyes to be a framerate that fluctuates somewhere between 30 and 60, excluding occasional slowdowns when ""combat-branding"" an uruk in the midst of a large group of enemies.

205,Persona 4 Arena Ultimax,30-Sep-14,Vince Ingenito,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/30/persona-4-arena-ultimax-review,"['Persona 4 Arena Ultimax is that one classmate of yours that always looks and sounds their incomparable best. They never have a hair out of place, they never put their foot in their mouth, they just look and sound infuriatingly good at all times. Ultimax dazzles with such unrelenting style that one might naturally assume that it lacks substance, and yet its a far deeper brawler than its predecessor thanks to all-new characters, shadow versions of existing ones, and a laundry list of smart system tweaks that spice up the already excellent gameplay significantly.', 'Just like 2012s original Persona 4 Arena, Ultimax puts on a great show regardless of how good you are at fighting games, especially if youre a fan of the wonderful JRPG series its based off of. Every part of the experience, starting from the opening cinematic, feels like its actually from Persona 4. That games exemplary tunes are put to good use in Ultimax, lending it a driving, toe-tapping energy both in and out of combat.', 'The meaty story mode benefits the most from the direct connection with Persona 4. It picks up where the events of Persona 4 Arena left off, which itself was a direct extension of the story told in Persona 4. Developer Arc System Works collaborated tightly with Atlus to create a ton of story content using the same voice actors, and presentational elements as the source material. The result is a story thats equally well-written and entertaining as anything from Persona 4. Thats no small feat, especially for a fighting game.', 'Just be warned: if youre just here for the fighting, story mode will test your patience with seemingly interminable stretches without any actual gameplay. Its more like a graphic novel with a few fights sprinkled in. Theres even an option to have the computer do the fighting for you, so people who just want to experience the story can do so.', 'Even outside of story mode though, Ultimax fully leverages the unique personality of Persona 4. Characters use Persona-appropriate spells like Ziodyne and Sukukaja, important locales like Junes are used as backdrops, and victory quotes make clever callbacks to the originals story. No other fighting game commits this completely to its own fiction, or weaves such a convincingly consistent world.', 'Even if you dont get all the references, the eye-popping color palette and strangely macabre art-direction are a one-two punch that gives every fight real character. If Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3 impresses with the kitchen sink approach to visual design, Ultimaxs brand of art direction and color theory is more akin to feng shui. That isnt to say it doesnt look out-there or audacious, because it most certainly does. But its character silhouettes are just so memorable, and its use of color so well-tempered, that it comes off as high fashion rather than total chaos.', 'Ultimaxs infectious personality and top-notch presentation arent a smokescreen intended to hide other deficiencies though, theyre just the garnish atop a well-prepared meal. The fighting here is every bit as accessible and deep as in P4A, but with even more nuance for intermediate and advanced players to delve into.', 'A host of new characters come with Ultimax, and they share the ingenious designs of the returning cast. Each is cleverly built around a unique mechanic or resource, like music, dogs, or baseball. You know...the fighting game staples. Where some games would stop at using these ideas cosmetically, Ultimax just runs with it, creating Dance Dance Revolution-esque mini-games, or a strike/ball/out counter to give characters like Rise and Junpei a fully fleshed-out, wholly unique feel.', 'As entertaining as they all are though, its the various subtle changes to the fighting system that really impressed me. The entire cast has been rebalanced, and while there are still dominant characters, the overall power curve between them feels flatter, making matchups that felt kind of hopeless before more workable.', 'The newly included Shadow versions of nearly the entire cast provide an entirely different way to approach characters you already know. They lack awakening mode, or a proper defensive burst, but in return they get constant access to their awakening super, the ability to carry super meter over between rounds, and something called Shadow Frenzy, which grants them nearly unlimited meter for a limited time. The combination of these elements makes them risky to play, since they dont have a get-out-of-jail-free card, but when fully utilized, Shadow Frenzy allows you to convert almost any loose hit into potentially match-ending damage. The risk and reward are pretty in line with one another, and scoring a fast second-round KO with a shadow character feels incredible.', 'My favorite overall change though, is how Fatal Counters now work. In addition to having moves that will score a fatal when landed on counter hit, there are now moves that, when stuffed or punished, will always result in a fatal, no matter what move was used to do so. It makes many moves that were once fairly safe more of a commitment, and opens up fatal combo possibilities considerably. Unrelenting pressure is still a huge part of how Ultimax is played, but at least now there are more opportunities to turn a good read into big-time damage.']",IGN
206,The Golf Club,25-Aug-14,Tristan Ogilvie,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/25/the-golf-club-review,"['EA Sports enjoyed a mostly uncontested stranglehold on the golf genre for the past decade, but with its re-tooled PGA Tour game not set to tee off until next year, 2014 presents the perfect opportunity for a new contender to swing its way into the market. Enter The Golf Club, a no-nonsense take on the walk-spoiling sport that makes up for its lack of licensed players and courses by applying a more realistic feel to its stroke play and featuring a robust course designer. Yet despite these strengths, its stiff challenge and bare-bones presentation make it a difficult approach for anyone other than diehard fans of the sport.', '\n', 'Little effort has been put into the creation of Golf Clubs golfers themselves. Not only can you not play as any PGA pros, you cant even play as yourself unless by remote chance you already look like one of the half a dozen non-editable players available. You can make slight alterations to the colour of each item of their clothing, but thats it. Anyone used to the dizzying amount of customisation options and myriad of real-world club and clothing manufacturers featured in the Tiger Woods games will likely be disappointed with the dearth of player-tailoring options on offer here.', 'A similarly stripped-back level of design has been applied to the presentation out on the holes themselves. Commentary is sparse, theres no gallery there to cheer you on, and youll certainly never see a ball explode off the tee with a smoke trail behind it or have your ego stroked by a multi-angle replay each time you nail a chip-in from off the green.', 'Yet The Golf Club is more about appropriating the feel of the sport rather than dressing it up with good looks or flashy gimmicks. Each shot you take is bereft of the assists typical to modern golf games - theres no swing timer to help you nail the right amount of power in your stroke, nor is there a virtual caddy to suggest which iron to use for your approach, nor aftertouch spin controls to correct a misplaced shot. All youre given is the basic information for each hole - wind direction, distance to the pin and the elevation of the cup. Its down to you to read the green and rely on instinct to choose the right club and shot type, and apply the right amount of power to your swing with the right thumbstick.', '', 'Putting is hard to judge at first.', 'Consequently, The Golf Club was really quite challenging for my first few hours with it, particularly due to the absence of any kind of tutorial mode. The slightest of deviations in each forward flick of the thumbstick caused balls to shank sideways into the brush, and it was tough to judge the length of my shots with the fully analogue putting. It seemed particularly hard to get to grips with after spending the past 10 years of my virtual golf career nestled within the Tiger Woods series more patronising embrace.', 'But things improved with patience and experience, and over time my scores came down as I grew more proficient in reading greens and adjusting for the lie of the ball. It felt organic and rewarding, not unlike the real thing, as opposed to compensating for my own deficiencies by lazily beefing out a set of stat points in order to artificially power up my player.', 'Having said that, The Golf Club does feel somewhat lacking as far as progression is concerned. One area in which the Tiger Woods games have excelled in recent years is keeping me engaged - I like the way it bombards us with spot-challenges and new gear to unlock at every turn. Without carrots like these to dangle in front of us in The Golf Club, theres little incentive to keep playing beyond the enjoyment and challenge of playing itself. Not that theres anything inherently wrong with that, but I would have appreciated some additional goals to strive for aside from merely trying to lower my handicap.', '', 'The course creator is excellent.', 'What did keep me returning to The Golf Club, however, was the sheer number of courses available. How many? A potentially infinite number, essentially - thanks to the powerful course creator and an active online community whose creations already number in the thousands. Granted, theyre not all gems, but you can sort the wheat from the chaff via the user ratings, and the more talented creators in the community have already been able to subvert The Golf Clubs lack of licensing by building convincing recreations of famous courses such as Pebble Beach and Augusta.', 'Creating a course yourself is a straightforward process. You first select from a basic set of variables - terrain type, foliage density and the like, and then a course is procedurally generated for you to use as the base for your design. From there you can do as much or as little as you want to it - widen fairways, reshape putting greens, add and remove hazards and more, and you can even dive down at any point from your god-view into the shoes of your player to put your tweaks to the test. Its an excellent feature entirely unprecedented for the genre - previously, the only additional courses we got our hands on in the Tiger Woods games came via paid-for DLC (or mods, on the PC side).', 'My only gripe with the sharing of created courses in The Golf Club is that theyre read-only - I would have liked the option to take another users course as a starting off point and then have the ability to edit it more to my tastes. It should also be said that course generation and editing is substantially slower on the Xbox One and PS4 than it is in the PC version, making the creation process feel a lot more sluggish. (At the time of writing the development team claim that a patch to address that is on the way.) Out on the course the frame rate is also noticeably choppier on the Xbox One and PS4.']",IGN

The Walking Dead: Season 2 -- Episode 5: No Going Back tempts its remaining cast members to cross lines and endure unbearable personal trials.', 'How they respond to main character Clementine, and each other, forces us to make some of the most difficult decisions of the season -- some of which make it painfully clear where you stand with people you once loved, hated, trusted, or doubted.', 'The hook of Telltales excellent point-and-click adventure series is engaging with these events -- either through dialogue choices or actions -- based on the kind of person your Clementine has become. Where Episode 4: Amid the Ruins rapidly and repeatedly wrote off characters, No Going Back spends a significant amount of time exploring who Clementine has left and what they mean to her. While Amid the Ruins is still a problematic episode, No Going Back capitalizes on its setup and pays it off with grace.', 'The slow, contemplative first hour sees these worn survivors reflecting on their lives, cracking jokes with each other, and trying their best to behave like things are normal again. It cant last.', 'Small problems spiral quickly out of control, and the calm is crushed by weighty, gut-wrenching dilemmas that place an enormous amount of pressure on Clementines group. Memorable moments cut to the bone in every scene. Bad situations test Clems resolve and her companions trust. Best-case scenario, someone earns their redemption -- but not before theyve salted the earth. Worst case? Thats up to you.', 'Its oddly fascinating to watch these peoples relationships deteriorate, crumble, or implode. The Walking Deads phenomenal, convincing character performances have never been better than this. Raging arguments made me genuinely uncomfortable, in the same way watching loved ones bicker might. I felt uneasy about numerous escalating tensions because I didnt know who was in the right, whose side to take, or even if I should make Clementine speak up.', 'I grew to fear, pity, hate, and forgive characters based on the horrors we endured together -- or because of each other. I love this series for its ability to evoke such a wide range of emotions, and No Going Back is the pinnacle of Season 2s provocative, painful, and unforgettable story.\nSeason 1 of The Walking Dead ends on a much different note than this, and it has significantly different goals. The conversations about how your Clementines story ended, and how you got there, will share comparable enthusiasm to that of Lee Everetts story.', 'Trading stories with others means learning of entirely different ways scenes could play out. Different decisions can take you to entirely different locations, with separate people. No Going Back is ambitious as a finale, and its clearly executed with confidence. Even loose ends you may wish to see wrapped up serve a purpose. Not everyones story gets bow-tied closure -- sometimes, things are entirely out of your hands, and the not knowing hurts just as bad as the truth might have.', 'The Walking Dead is a strange beast in that the more miserable it makes its audience, the better it is. In comics, television, and video games, one of the greatest measures of success is if it can make you feel how horrible it feels to be part of its world. In that respect, Season 2 of Telltale Games series is in the upper echelon of all Walking Dead fiction.', 'Clementine is a strong lead, stronger and steeled than most in my story than most, Id wager. But having seen all the options laid out as I played, this doesnt have to be the case, and knowing that is a powerful feeling. It may make for an even better finale than the superb conclusion I built for my Clementine -- a person whose true colors have finally been laid bare.', 'I dont think Lee Everett would recognize her anymore.']",IGN

The short version is that smashing huge hordes of zombies into goo with ridiculous home-made weapons - such as a sledge hammer with a cement saw tied to it or a toy robot bear with a light machine gun - or driving through them with a flame-throwing steamroller/motorcycle hybrid is, as ever, absolutely madness. It's even better when you bring in a friend in co-op, and the two of you compete to see who can wear the most idiotic outfit."", '\n', 'Watch the original Dead Rising 3 review here.', ""All of that is the same in the new PC version, which includes the four Untold Stories of Los Perdidos DLC episodes but not the goofier Super Ultra Dead Rising 3 Arcade Remix Hyper Edition EX Plus Alpha. The biggest difference is that it's noticeably better looking, thanks to the ability to run at full 1920x1080 resolution and, if you make a simple tweak to an .ini file in the Dead Rising 3 directory, can run with an uncapped frame rate. (Create a text file and rename it to user.ini, then paste in: gmpcr_unlock_frame_rate = True with no quotes. Place it in the same folder as deadrising3.exe before running the game.) It's strange that there's no menu option to remove the default 30fps cap, though, and you probably shouldn't expect to get a full, steady 60fps unless you're running at medium settings - even my Core i5-4670K and GeForce GTX 780 weren't capable of sustaining it with maxed-out settings when in the midst of a horde. I also noticed a bit of pop-in on certain objects, which carries over from the Xbox One version. Dead Rising 3 will never be the prettiest of games, but it's a damn fun one."", ""I played mostly on mouse and keyboard, though an Xbox 360 gamepad is naturally supported. Controls are definitely usable - I did a little remapping from defaults - but there's some weirdness.

I played year-round throughout my childhood, and I watch it religiously (go Islanders!). One of the reasons I love hockey so much is because it's fast, strategic, and dynamic on so many different levels. The good news is that NHL 15 understands this. It's fun to play on a moment-to-moment level, and it's accessible to anyone that can hold a controller; should you want to delve into its finer points, there are complex techniques like poke checking, throwing your body around, and winning battles in the corners."", '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', ""The bad news is that on a big-picture level, NHL 15 foregoes and forgets much of the minutia that hardcore hockey fans really care about. For as solidly as it plays, some of the series' most important hooks - some of which inspired me to cheer it on in past years - have completely disappeared. On the ice, NHL 15 shines. But everything around it feels a tad bit empty."", ""EA's NHL series typically totes strong gameplay, and it's as impressive as ever in NHL 15. Better yet, it's highly customizable. Camera angles can be altered, pre-determined difficulty settings can be tinkered with, and you can even set how arcadey or simulation-like you want the overall experience to be. Hate icing? Shut it off. Going offside the bane of your existence? Eliminate it completely. You can even determine how often a fight happens, the likelihood of a player breaking his stick, or whether you want to deal with injuries. And of course, you can pick your control style. It's cool that you can make something as meaningless as an exhibition game with your friend all your own by editing so many different facets, even if many of these options aren't exactly new."", ""Speaking of modes, NHL 15 is noticeably lighter than old-gen iterations on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 (and, in fact, the old-gen version of NHL 15, which is a clone of last year's), and this is where the overall package begins to diminish. Online Team Play is gone, as is EA Sports Hockey League, which were two community lynchpins. You can still play single ranked or unranked games online -- everything goes very smoothly when connected, with reasonable load times and no noticeable lag -- and you can bring your Ultimate Team online, too. Hockey Ultimate Team is still enjoyable in its own right, with the ability to create unique squads with a hodgepodge of players from different teams, leagues, and skill levels. It might just be NHL 15's meatiest and most substantial option."", ""As a single-player-centric gamer myself, I've always gravitated towards offline modes, which is where the lack of content really started to sink in. NHL 15 doesn't even have a Season Mode, which was originally introduced in the Super Nintendo and SEGA Genesis era. To play a season, I had to actually jump into Be A GM Mode... only to find that  its been stripped of some of its own features, including basic online functionality. Be A GM Mode is actually awesome; I've enjoyed it in years past and it's always made me want a fully fleshed-out NHL game where you're a general manager. But it's really unfortunate that you have to extract Season Mode out of it instead of keeping them separate. I'm confused why I can't play a single season as a team of my choice without having to jump through hoops. It's 2014, not 1994."", ""Be A Pro mode has also taken multiple hits. You can no longer be drafted by an organization and work your way up through the ranks from lesser, ancillary leagues and into the pros. Now, you're drafted by an organization and you immediately -- and mysteriously -- make the team. I created a pro that was drafted by the Montreal Canadiens. As I played, I was as confused as to why I couldn't skip forward to my next shift automatically as I was confused by how I -- a young rookie on the periphery of the roster -- could just jump on the ice whenever I wanted. Be A Pro still has deep customization options, but it also felt hollow and half-baked."", ""With all of that said, EA Sports has certainly created a pretty game, to the point where multiple people in the IGN office told me that from afar, they thought I was watching a real hockey game for a moment. Naturally, NHL 15 still suffers from some awkward animations and occasional glitchiness, but I was impressed by the relatively lifelike player faces and the flow of their sweaters. There are lots of little touches, from a center approaching the circle while looking behind him and chattering with his defensemen, to goal celebrations like jumping into the glass in the corner as teammates crowd around. Slow-mo replays of awesome goals are heightened by the realistic craziness of the crowd behind the glass. The crowds a bit more awkward at full speed, though. The camera often cuts to identical fans executing identical animations, and I've never seen so many ****-talking away-team fans in real life as I saw in NHL 15. I'm pretty sure a Senators fan wouldn't make it out of Toronto alive if he was taunting the home crowd like that."", ""EA Sports has also nailed the sounds of hockey; the slash of a skate on fresh ice, the bounce of a puck into the boards, the collision of rubber on the crossbar. When I think about playing hockey, I think about the smell of the locker room, the sound of the Zamboni laying a fresh sheet down, and all of those aforementioned noises of the game. I'm so pleased that the telltale audio cues of hockey were captured so realistically, even if the crowd noise itself leaves something to be desired."", 'I also mostly enjoyed NHL 15\'s integration with NBC\'s hockey telecast. First of all, I\'m a huge, huge fan of Doc Emrick. I think he\'s the best in the business. So hearing him, alongside Eddie Olczyk and ""Chicken Parm"" Ray Ferraro is a real treat. Still, Docs delivery feels a bit stilted. There are none of his quintessential freak-out moments, and his famously vast vocabulary isn\'t utilized well. Olczyk throws in a few memorable lines, but Ferraro\'s lines seem rushed. They also collectively seem off the mark fairly often. Doc will announce that a perfect pass just occurred as I threw a puck into traffic in the slot, losing it to an aggressive defenseman. A goalie can be scrambling in the crease, making multiple acrobatic saves, as Doc notes that those saves were ""easy."" Ferraro in particular seems off-kilter; he made comments multiple times during Be A GM Mode games that made it seem like I was in the 50th game of the season, not the 3rd. Little things like this are minor, but they can be grating if you\'re looking for immersion and realism.', 'Likewise, using real video imagery of Doc and Eddie against fake, in-game footage was jarring. It was cool to hear that music, see the same scoreboard graphics, and witness the intros to each city, with helicopter shots of the arenas, skylines, and other geography. But slow-mo recaps of goals and other memorable moments are ruined by sharp edits between scenes that have the action stop for split seconds at a time. The most awkward recaps of them all are for fights, when you see that gloves are dropped by both players in literally one or two frames. These scenes in particular look so weird and unrealistic.']",IGN

Its a roleplaying adventure game in which the idea of a warm welcome is a book on a pedestal that makes the floor drop away when you try to pick it up, with an instant death that sends you right back to the main menu with little more than a mocking comment. Dont let anyone tell you that this is simply old-school brutality. The original Shadowgate of 1987 was the Vlad the Impaler of its day; in an era where violence and cruelty was expected, it was still a game people looked at and whispered Damn... So for fans of Shadowgate, this is a mostly excellent remake, but very much something you have to go into expecting to take a beating.', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'Its not simply the original game with modern graphics, but an expanded version of it with brand-new rooms and altered puzzles, and three difficulty levels. These affect affect both the in-game timers, like how long your torches last before plunging you into lethal blackness, and a number of the puzzles. On Journeyman level for instance, a wraith of cold and dark can be defeated by shoving your torch into it. On Master level, you need an enchanted flame to take it out.', 'The new content is a mixed blessing, but mostly an improvement. Theres more story this time, though its still largely trivial, humourless, and with an ending more interested in selling you the sequel than wrapping this specific adventure up. The additional bits in the opening caves and castle itself are mostly solid, though the castle suffers from being far less focused just as the map explodes in size, and an extended trip through crystal caves later on contributes little but boredom when the adventure should be politely wrapping up.', 'Still, its all familiar enough to still feel nostalgic, while different enough to demand a return to the same kind of thinking as the original game rather than simply repeating well-trodden steps. For extra nostalgia, its also possible to play with the original music, transitions, and text. The new graphics are recommend, though, because they offer an excellent sense of place. Lavishly drawn backgrounds look like other games concept art and some minimalist but good use of sound and animation pay off, especially in the particle effects and glows that add a sense of life to the static backgrounds. The creepy way the danger music rises as your torch starts flickering is a great touch, too.', 'Less satisfyingly though, the UI feels like a product of the 80s, with very clunky and slow interactions and nowhere near enough unique responses to the verbs to justify having them all, instead of figuring that youll always want to hit the goblin or open the door. Anything that involves going back and forward between inventory and main screen is just too slow, and not helped by Shadowgate insisting that item interactions are done in the right order - using Mirror on Hammer gives a shrug instead of just whacking the silly thing. The clumsiness can also lead to death at times, like with the dragon puzzle from the original game. As before, you have to hastily grab a shield to protect against its fire breath long enough to get items. Here, though, you have to specifically use it on yourself rather than take it. Every death also means sitting through the death itself, plus any animations and text, and the death screen, and going back to the main menu, before being able to load a save and try another approach.', 'So, thats for existing fans: A lovingly made, very true-to_the-original game thats a little less cruel, but certainly hasnt gone soft. Less cruel here is, after all, defined as double-checking that you really do want to kill yourself with your own sword before actually letting you slice your throat open. But how about new players? Is it worth jumping in and seeing what the fuss is about?', 'Probably not, no. If you do, be prepared for much frustration. Shadowgate is hard, which is good, but its often unfair about that, which is not. Its idea of a time limit, for instance, is a banshee curse inflicted early in the adventure that can easily kill you long before you find the cure, with a second time limit thanks to the torches (which are in limited supply) and puzzles that are often poorly signposted. Whats part of a later puzzle, or often, what affects what - is trial and error, even with a floating skull on hand to offer vague hints - and trial by constantly backtracking through a huge map in search of anything that will do anything except kill you, and fully aware that time will eventually do it if the dungeon doesnt.', 'Bear in mind too that objects can be anywhere in the world, and not necessarily accessible or obvious. At one point for instance, you need to make a grappling hook. Even with a minor prompt if you happen to look at it, its not a particularly intuitive leap from that to the hook-shaped stand of a burning brazier in a previous part of the world, especially when theres a whole other puzzle chain to get it.', 'Like a lot of classic games, Shadowgate is reliant on nostalgia value for getting away with a lot, and for fans who know what to expect, thats fine. There is, however, a reason this kind of design  was viciously beaten to death with a baseball bat and buried in quicklime in the early parts of the 90s: Its bad. If a new game came out today out using Shadowgates design tropes, but without the familiar name to justify them, it wouldnt be remotely acceptable.']",IGN

Its latest, Azure Striker Gunvolt, is an original game that represents a natural evolution of that appreciation of retro gaming, done in the style of Mega Man X. While it's in no way, shape, or form as good as X, it's certainly fun in its own right, and like Mega Man 9 and 10 before it, it provides a nostalgic trip for anyone who still finds value in games from an era gone by."", 'The most unique aspect of Azure Striker Gunvolt is its combat. Gunvolt\'s titular protagonist is armed with a pistol, but you won\'t be using it in typical fashion. Regardless of which gun he\'s equipped with -- there are several -- they simply won\'t do much damage. What these pistols will do is ""tag"" enemies when fired. Once an enemy is tagged, Gunvolt is able to unleash his true power, shocking robotic thugs with electrical pulses called Flashfields that automatically gravitate towards those who are marked. This novel style of play is decidedly more complex than Mega Man X\'s.', '\n\n', '', ""Thankfully, this different approach to killing things doesn't harm the speed and fluidity of Azure Striker Gunvolt, which constantly goads you to keep on moving. It's not nearly as fast as Sonic, nor is it as deliberate as Castlevania. Gunvolt nails a comfortable space right in the middle. Unfortunately, while marking and destroying robots is incredibly satisfying, the disappointingly small roster of enemies diminished that satisfaction as I advanced. The lack of diversity between the robotic fodder Gunvolt is expected to obliterate is actually staggering, with only small groupings of land-based and aerial foes to deal with. Ive seen more enemy diversity in early NES games."", ""Not surprisingly, level structure takes a page or two out of the book of design from -- you guessed it -- Mega Man X. You can visit most stages in any order you'd like, fighting a member of a cast of well-designed bosses at the end of each. Each Sumeragi agent employs his or her own unique set of skills and battle styles, skills and styles that, along with their respective stages, have an industrial design reminiscent of many early-to-mid-'90s platformers, though some designs do blur together in a sort of sameness. I especially dug fighting the Sumeragi agent Elise, who splits into two like Gemini Man in Mega Man 3, and Daytona, who seals his lair with fire, lessening the space you have to maneuver."", ""Unfortunately, Gunvolt's story doesnt do it any favors. It's confusing, frankly, and full of tropes, not all that unlike the 16-bit era games that inspired it. I like Gunvolt and his friends from a design perspective, with their 90s sci-fi aesthetic and interesting personalities, but I would have liked to hear less from them, especially as dialogue -- while skippable -- gets in the way of gameplay more often than not. Still, I have to give it up for Azure Striker Gunvolt's rock-solid translation. Dialogue doesn't read stilted or awkwardly, even if it does obstruct progress, so if you want to jump into the lore, you can do so with a higher level of polish than many games coming out of Japan."", '\n\n', '', ""Access to special skills -- like an enormous lightning burst or a gigantic energy sword -- is also given, but things arent quite Mega Man-esque, as a leveling system dictates which skills you learn (while also giving Gunvolt more and more hit points). But unlike classic platformers like Mega Man, Metroid, and Castlevania, the unlockable skills dont interact with the levels in any interesting or necessary ways. In fact, I used one skill pretty much continuously throughout the game -- a curative move that slightly healed me when activated with 3DS touch screen -- and never felt the need to switch. It's cool that there are skills to exploit, but levels need to be designed to prompt me to try new things by making some skills advantageous or disadventagous in certain circumstances, or theyre pointless. With only three skill points to use at a time, and with those points regenerating slowly, some of the more powerful skills wipe out your meter completely; thats a real head-scratcher of a design decision that made me gun shy about trying them at all."", ""Indeed, for as fun as Azure Striker Gunvolt is to play, it definitely suffers from its fair share of questionable design choices. For starters, while I absolutely adore the customization options available -- you can equip items to both eyes and you can wear both rings and pendants with special powers -- I was dismayed by the fact that there wasn't much availability in terms of actually owning these items. Necessary components are so exceedingly rare that during the five or so hours it took me to beat the campaign, I never once had anything to equip on either eye. I only ever had the components to build two items -- both rings -- the entire game. Worse yet, those rings both essentially did the same thing! To have anything to build and equip, I would have to play stages over and over again, mastering each and raising my high score, when all I really wanted to do was move on with the campaign. How disappointing."", '\n\n', '', ""Still, for as incredibly short-sighted as the customization and equipping options are in Azure Striker Gunvolt, there's still plenty to keep you engaged for multiple playthroughs. I loved the old-school inspired scoring system, which revolves around injuring enemies consecutively without being hit (this is called Kudos in-game). There's also a system that gauges how quickly you work through a given stage, with better times and higher scores in turn awarding rarer items for synthesis. And if you want to get deep into the nitty-gritty, an optional Challenges list, unique for each stage, provides for more difficult goals to accomplish in each one, again rewarding components for your success. There's real depth here, should you decide to start digging. Then again, to see your way through the end, you don't have to do any of ancillary activities at all.""]",IGN

On more than one occasion, I found myself approaching the potential problems with a strategy reminiscent of the planning required by a Batman: Arkham City challenge room. Before stepping into the chamber, I had to size up the threats, go over my options, plot a plan of attack, and calculate contingencies.', 'My careful planning didnt always turn out as expected. I remember patting myself on the back after skillfully dispatching a particularly nasty foe, only to watch his scattered body parts regather themselves as he sprang back to life. Crown of the Old Iron King managed to scare and surprise me more than once with clever new twists. Seas of heaped ash provide ample hiding places for enemies to spring up and attack when least expected. Glowing idols scattered around the map created volatile adverse effects, from summoning new foes to rendering certain nearby enemies immortal.', 'Whenever I stepped outdoors, though, the immersiveness was broken a bit by some truly ugly, smeared renderings of the distant landscapes. With such a fiery and nightmarish theme to work with, Id hoped to see something comparable in splendor to the lovely seaside beauty of Majula reflected in the distance. This just doesnt compare.', 'Crown of the Old Iron King is predictably difficult, but the boss encounter scaling extends beyond grueling and into ludicrous territory. I met one titanic foe in New Game Plus Plus whom I failed to defeat after more than 100 attempts. Ive never before encountered a challenge in a Dark Souls game I couldnt overcome with persistence, and I couldnt help but feel a bit frustrated.

I was relieved I didnt have to waste time with the first year of school, as the focus wasnt on my human characters entrance into the all-bird institution, but was instead on the in-depth stories and relationships she shared with her classmates.', 'If you dont use the fast-forward button to skip through the text, Hatoful Boyfriend takes a little over an hour to play through. To really complete it, however, requires you to replay multiple times in order to explore the alternate paths of the eight datable birds. This didnt feel like a burden, because allusions to greater mysteries in other birds paths did a great job of encouraging me to replay it well over 10 times. I was intrigued by the potential for numerous endings shown in the gallery, and in mysterious documents in the archive that give little details about the world.', 'Like most dating simulations, Hatoful Boyfriend is a visual novel and only requires mouse clicks to progress, but it creatively uses that very simple interaction to build suspense and add to the mood. While one click usually gets you through a sentence or two of dialogue, sometimes only one word or phrase appear with a click. Regrettably, the stats system misses that mark. Wisdom, vitality, and charisma can be leveled up on elective days and through random events, but its not immediately apparent how leveling them benefits you. It was a bit annoying that it took me multiple playthroughs to find a benefit to leveling certain stats.', 'No matter your desired path, the beginning of each playthrough begins the same: You enter school, meet the datable birds, and rush through your first term. Though the writing is immensely enjoyable, the first term suffers from pacing issues. I bounced between so many events, it felt like time was passing by too quickly, which seemed like a wasted opportunity for me to get to know each of the birds better before deciding which to pursue. However, once you begin to follow the path of a certain bird, the story becomes more focused. The witty writing embraces Hatoful Boyfriends silly concept, using words such as everybird and nobirdie, and pokes fun at some birds real-world quirks, like the Fantail pigeons attraction to shiny things. However, the best part is the characters.', 'Hatoful Boyfriend doesnt pass up on the stereotypical male roles of a dating sim -- the shy guy, the playful bully, the best friend, and the popular guy, just to name a few -- but it pushes its characters past their stereotypes and led me to care and sympathize with each birds story. Surprisingly, its not awkward to date the birds. Better yet, the protagonist is just as interesting as the birds she pursues. As a self-proclaimed hunter-gatherer and the only human in the school, its fun to learn about her interests and personality as she interacts with the birds. In addition to cute new backgrounds that contrast well against the stock-photo pigeons, the Steam release of Hatoful Boyfriend adds a new scene for the only female bird, Azami.

Super speed is a great power, and all the most important aspects, like endless speed, are unlocked from the get-go. The only thing is, it was a bit of a drag to spend about four hours with access to just one power set after playing with four as Delsin.', ""Maybe that wouldve been less of an issue if Sucker Punch had come up with some really new and interesting stuff to do with the neon powers, but theres not enough of that here. Fetch has a few new tricks, like running through swirly pink clouds placed on the streets and rooftops of Seattle for speed boosts  that makes running from point A to point B a little more entertaining, because we have small objectives to go for, and hitting one gives a sense of speed that makes Fetch's normal pace seem like a jog. There are some combat upgrades too, like neon homing missiles and melee finishers. Theyre neat, but not a big deal  I had to go back and check to see if some of these were in Second Son because they didnt really stand out. That, and none of the fights against gangsters in First Light stack up against the more spectacular battles to take out DUP Mobile Command Units in Second Son. Too many of these missions are repetitive sniper-mode shooting galleries, too."", 'I do like how the story is framed as Augustine prodding Fetch to recall her emotional effort to save her brother in flashback sequences.

While having the BioShock experience up close and personal via tablet or phone with slight but not deal-breaking audio-visual concessions is great for immersion, some perplexing touch-screen control decisions bring new frustrations to the forefront."", ""Whether this is your first trip to Rapture or a return visit after seven years away, BioShock's story and setting remain enthralling. While the textures aren't as detailed or the splicers movement as smooth as they are on a decent PC or the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions (read our 2007 BioShock review), the underwater dystopia is still a sight to behold and a marvel to listen to. Moments like scouring a dilapidated office for supplies with creepy posters adorning the walls while a psychopath has an creepy conversation with himself and a static-tinged 1940s tune plays in the background really cement the almost survival-horror nature of BioShock. If you're playing on an iPad with a decent set of headphones and notifications off, the immersion of the iOS version makes up for a lot, as there's precious little to distract you from Rapture's charms."", ""When it comes to combat, however, the touch-screen controls aren't quite up to snuff. Surprisingly, movement and aiming is actually done reasonably well with virtual analog sticks. As you'd probably gather, iOS touch screens can't replicate the precision of a mouse and keyboard or gaming controller when it comes to combat. Firing a gun or a plasmid is a bit less intuitive than it's been in previous versions of BioShock, but at least those have big, hard-to-miss icons to tap. At the beginning, when you're facing off against one or two lightly armed splicers with the Electro Bolt plasmid and a wrench or pistol, I started to get the sense that iOS devices just might be able to handle BioShock's combat. However, as the encounters and your artillery get more complicated, the platform's ability to support it diminishes greatly."", ""Even with the removal of the jump button, finding your way through Rapture is still simple enough, though you may find yourself accidentally tapping the crouch button from time to time. However, it would have been nice to be able to set waypoints during the periods that the directional arrow isn't pointing you towards your next objective, as constantly bringing up the map via the tiny menu button in the upper left corner can be frustrating."", ""Perhaps the most egregious control change for iOS is the use of first aid items. What was a simple button or key press on physical controls has become the equivalent of rubbing your stomach while patting your head. You have to basically remove your thumb from the virtual thumbstick or stop aiming with your right hand and press the health bar icon in the upper-left corner. Seeing as how you're likely in the heat of combat when you need to do that, losing movement or aiming for a second or two as you heal is simply unacceptable, especially when you're taking on Big Daddies that can sap nearly your entire life bar early on. Changing guns or plasmids is also a bit of a chore. Instead of bringing up a radial menu with the push of a button, you can either tediously scroll through your weapons or access an immersion-breaking menu that lists everything. Honestly, I wouldnt have an issue if the game included auto-healing when youre near death and weapon-switching when youve completely depleted a guns ammo. The Pipe Dream-style hacking puzzles are also surprisingly more difficult with a touch screen. They're certainly manageable (especially when tonics make them easier later on), but you may find yourself overwhelmed by the speed of the puzzles and the slightly unwieldy tile-swapping at first."", ""While it would have been nice to have the Challenge Rooms that were added to the PlayStation 3 version of BioShock, there are a few neat little bonuses that come with the iOS version. There's some decent stat tracking with fun graphs showing your plasmid and gun usage, and if you've got a sizable GameCenter friends list, you can check out leaderboards. You can also peruse BioShock's lengthy art book that lends itself nicely to tablet navigation.""]",IGN

Down there I realized those same enemies that are easy to defeat on the surface felt far more challenging to fight in the confines of a rocky corridor where they could ambush me. The amount of danger I was in was tied to how far from my base I roamed.', 'Losing everything I carried to a Creeper who got the drop on me was a heartbreaking lesson, but the excitement of exploring new places and the risk it entails provided a constant tension.

However, that 20 minutes is a tantalizing throwback to an era that preceded and inspired 16-bit side-scrollers like Mega Man X. Unlike Azure Gunvolt, Mighty doesn't bring anything new to the table, but I'm pretty sure that was the idea. It's part of its charm."", ""If Azure Striker Gunvolt -- which we loved -- is Japanese developer Inti Create's 16-bit revival project, then Mighty Gunvolt is Azure's 8-bit icing. The original Mega Man is clearly the point of origin for Mighty Gunvolt. Everything about it -- its fluid gameplay, its simple-yet-colorful backgrounds, its soundtrack, and even its point system -- is a throwback to the Blue Bomber's original adventure. Heck, getting through its five stages takes a comparable amount of time it takes an expert to get through Mega Man's six initial stages. There are a lot of parallels old-schoolers will appreciate, which breeds welcome familiarity."", ""Much more like Mega Man 10 than Mega Man, there are multiple characters to choose from: Gunvolt himself, Beck from the upcoming Mighty No. 9, and Ekoro from Inti Creates Japanese-only rail shooter, GalGun. Each character has his or her own strengths, weakness, and special abilities, though they all have access to the same five stages and boss battles. I liked playing as Gunvolt the best. He's perfectly balanced, though Ekoro and Beck have their uses too. Ekoro is the weakest offensively, but she can float like the Princess in Super Mario Bros. 2, which is useful at various times during the brief campaign. Beck sports a handy dash ability that allows you to uncover otherwise inaccessible areas, though there's a different reason you might want to play him: it's the very first time Mighty No. 9's main character has been playable anywhere. And for those of us stoked about Inafune's promising upcoming project, that's pretty damn cool."", ""Each of the five stages, along with the enemies that occupy them, are pulled from Azure's campaign; they've just been reimagined in an older 8-bit style. Seeing Inti Creates realize their 16-bit creations in a simplified way provides some awesome design insight, especially if you played and beat Azure Striker Gunvolt before playing Mighty Gunvolt (which is, by the way, the order you should take the two games on).

It's entirely intentional, and it's a really nice touch.

Im having a hard time saying goodbye to her, admittedly, so I have her drinking anti-aging potions. I encounter this problem with a lot of Sims games, and this time its even worse (because a lot of things are better). But at the same time, The Sims 4s lack of features and small world hasnt let Jess live her life to the fullest. Even though its fun, its a big letdown that this sequel doesnt inspire the same wow factor that The Sims 3 did when I first played it years ago.', 'When I created Jess, I was immediately impressed by the appearance-customization options. Picking a Sims walk style, which can vary from tough to feminine, does a lot to express personality (and itll change to a slouch if theyre tired or an I have to pee walk when their bladders are uncomfortably full). The new Create-a-Sim in general is really intuitive, allowing you to push and pull at different parts of a Sims body in order to get the exact size and shape youre looking for. Im a huge believer in body positivity and beauty in all bodies, so seeing more realistic representations of various body types was really encouraging. I gave Jess thick thighs and hips and kept her upper body lean, because I finally could.', 'I was disappointed, however, that I could give her only four total traits  three, if you dont count the trait associated with her lifetime aspiration.

It turned out to be less of a problem than Id imagined, though, because the addition of emotions makes a lot out of a little.', 'Trying to get Jess a date was my first brush with the new emotional axis to Sims personalities, a system that successfully supplants traits as a more realistic way for Sims to live and interact. I quickly learned that Jess, who I gave the romantic trait, very easily swung into flirty feelings. Feeling flirty unlocked several fun interaction options, like posing seductively or taking a cold shower to quell thoughts of WooHoo. (Pro tip: Use some of the flirty options before jumping straight to WooHoo. In the spirit of realism, Sims will get a better mood boost from it afterward.) On the other hand, going too long without flirting made her tense, which opened up another set of actions.', 'Thats the best thing about emotions in The Sims 4: They provide new contextual opportunities to Sims, like being able to tell a self-deprecating joke when embarrassed, and make a lot more sense than just having static interactions based on personality traits.

Conversations, it follows, have a similar ease of flow. Jamari, a line cook, would come home and make food for Jess and Juniper while having a conversation with both of them, easily switching between blowing kisses at the former and telling jokes to the latter. Its really nice to not have to micromanage Sims interactions at every turn, and its especially fun to watch where these more intelligent conversations go when youre not interfering. On more than one occasion, Ive watched Sims gain the embarrassed emotion while chatting because of a misguided romantic advance or a joke that no one really got.', 'Are you ready for a break from the feels? Me too! On the absolutely non-emotional side of The Sims 4, Build Mode has been significantly improved over The Sims 3s version. I was particularly excited about cabinet and counter customization; you can have super-cool half-counters to end a kitchen in a less abrupt way or half-cabinets for over the fridge. Trust me, its really cool. Probably more universally exciting are the ability to pick up entire rooms and move them anywhere on the lot without razing them to the ground and rebuilding them, and the push-and-pull tool (similar to body mod in Create-a-Sim) which allows you to move or resize an entire length of wall all at once. Some of the new tools are quirky, however  foundations are now applied retroactively, which is cool if youre like me and dont feel like demolishing an entire house just to add a porch, but they apply to every structure on the entire lot. This means no split-levels and no garages, but since there arent any cars in The Sims 4, the latter isnt a huge deal.', 'Except no cars in The Sims 4 is a huge deal, because this is supposed to be a people simulation, and people very often have cars. People also dont erupt from the bassinet and immediately enter childhood, but Sims in The Sims 4 do, since there are no toddlers. The Sims 3s Create-a-Style tool is also history, a bit of a letdown for my interior design sensibilities. Granted, I was successfully able to give Jess and Jamari a matching, cohesive space-age house with the tools available, but Im still sad that I cant make cool pajamas in the exact print I want or buy a couch in the style Id like while also picking a nice color. Pools, though, are perhaps the most conspicuous and ridiculous omission. For a decade-plus theyve been well-known as the most popular way to murder Sims, if youre into that. Both build options and furnishing options seem really barren at this point, but knowing The Sims, that will be remedied in one way or another eventually (for a fee, of course).']",IGN

Picturesque, static backdrops are slyly blended with wide-open spaces and large vertical terrain features, creating an effective illusion of scale. The many stunning vistas go a long way towards making Destiny's world feel like one that's worth saving, despite the fact that you cant fully explore everything you see."", ""Even if it isn't as wide-open as it initially appears, each of Destiny's four main planets are more than big enough to get lost in. Even atop your speedy, instantly summonable Sparrow bike, which gleefully handles a lot like what I always imagined a Star Wars speeder bike might, getting from one end of a planet to the other takes a while. Factor in all the caves, temples, and other structures housed within, and there's a ton of ground to cover. Perhaps not as much as an open-world RPG or an MMO, but then, despite its similarities, Destiny isn't either of those things  and its overall topography has more character than most games of those types anyway."", ""Even on last-gen hardware, the craft on display throughout Destiny's alien landscapes is masterful in its detail. Every rock face, outpost, and ruin looks lovingly hand-crafted, aside from a few repeating nooks and crannies. Even if I didn't always stop to gawk at how roads look physically carved into the terrain, or how gas bubbles to the surface of the iridescent water pools on Venus, these details silently pulled me in and constantly reinforced the idea that that this is an actual place  a special place."", 'Consistently excellent music magnifies that sensation, deftly driving the action forward during big firefights, and conveying a sense of wonder and mystery in between them. Even the somewhat over-indulgent load screen animations between worlds are eye-catching. Bungie made lemonade out of lemons here. Going from one planet to the other takes way too long, but its wisely used as an opportunity to double down on the idea that all these places are connected.', ""Sadly, none of that keeps Destiny from becoming the latest example of the friction between open-world design, and tightly directed narrative. Cutscenes are kept to a bare minimum, limiting the story to vague exposition dumps before and after missions. It's not a new, or effective way to unintrusively tell a story though, regardless of how many Emmy Award-nominated actors you have reciting the lines. It says a lot about the quality of Destiny's combat that I gladly continued to move and shoot, despite it never really giving me an emotional incentive to do so."", '', '\n', ""Destiny retains the fluid, tactical feel of the Halo series, but with an increased sense of speed and mobility that make its firefights feel more dynamic than those of its direct FPS ancestor. Thats partly due to the ability to sprint and slide in addition to each class' mobility skills, which include gliding, double jumping, and even short-range teleportation. Combined with how powerful grenades and melee attacks feel, thanks again to class skills that modify them, this extra mobility allows you to engage foes in a wider variety of ways."", ""Destiny's intelligently designed combat areas provide excellent opportunities to leverage those options. Its an impressive design feat when you consider how organically these areas blend with the open spaces that tie them together. I could, for instance, toss out a big vortex grenade to control space and force my enemies to back up behind cover, then sprint towards them, glide clear over their cover to greet them with a shotgun blast, and then catapult up to safety on a ledge above. Cover is smartly placed, and theres enough horizontal and vertical space to allow for a variety of approaches, even in the most straightforward combat scenarios."", ""You'll face four different races over the course of your journey, and their armies are each diverse and interesting. The cunning, multi-armed Fallen make excellent use of cover, will actively flank your position, and even attempt to lure you into ambushes. Other foes, like the robotic Vex, can teleport directly into combat out of nowhere, and still others have jump packs, cloaking devices, or massive riot shields to aid their advances. The range of different problems they can give you to solve is downright impressive, which keeps the combat fresh, and exciting throughout."", 'That is, with the exception of some of the bosses, who are mostly just super-sized versions of existing enemies with a lot more hit points. The two or three bosses that dont fit that description, like the imposing spider tank, require more from you - youll have to find weak spots and coordinate with teammates to to stay alive, which resulted in more than one exciting we did it! moment.', 'On the whole, the combat is so well executed that I never once tired of fighting in the multitude of hours Ive played so far. That says a lot considering that fighting is, disappointingly, the only way you can meaningfully interact with the beautiful world around you.', '', '\n', ""Outside of combat, Destiny postures itself as far more than a simple FPS, but while its various RPG elements add some extra layers on top of its well-done combat, they don't feel fully explored or fleshed out. Part of that is because of what a poor job Destiny does of educating us about all of its moving parts, but it's also because its so hell-bent on being all things to all people that it unsurprisingly drops the ball in places."", ""Destiny's class and skill systems are the biggest victims of this. The Hunter, Warlock, and Titan all do the same things (stay alive and kill stuff), just in subtly different ways. Everybody can use every weapon type with equal proficiency, and until you get to the very highest levels of endgame gear, class-specific armor mostly just looks different."", 'Next to how well-differentiated classes feel in Borderlands 2, or even Battlefield 4, none of Destinys classes feel like they bring anything indispensable to a party. As a direct result, playing cooperatively with others feels more like shooting stuff with friends rather than a carefully coordinated dungeon party. Its still a good time, especially during the excellent co-operative strike missions, but it lacks the depth I look for in class-based games.', 'The RPG element that succeeds the most is the loot game. It doesnt overwhelm with any sort of statistical complexity, but rather engages by presenting clear, meaningful choices. It gets off to a slow start though. Drop rates seem abysmal until somewhere around level 11 or 12, and gear has too few unique stats until then either. Eventually though, weapons and armor start dropping with interesting mods, and entire upgrade trees that allow you to tailor their feel and performance in interesting ways.', ""From weapons that reload faster when their clip is completely empty, to ones that speed up your ability cooldowns when you score kills with them, there's actually a decent number of different ways to gear. Especially when you start getting into the legendary and exotic loot tiers after level 20, surprises keep coming from new, even crazier mods."", ""The problem though, is that the methods for earning post-story gear aren't clearly explained or, in some cases, even alluded to over the course of Destiny's 12-hour campaign. Youll need to coordinate which bounties you take with what patrols you want to do, grind for several different currencies, and rank up your standing with a handful of factions - several of which are tucked away in the dark corners of the Tower hub. Theres a lot of room for post-story progression, but you either just start stumbling onto it...or you don't. For a game that trips all over itself to be simple and accessible to everybody, that's an unnecessarily confusing curveball to hit."", '', '\n', ""The half-baked nature of Destiny's RPG elements are just a symptom of a far larger issue: This is a game thats straddling the borders between too many kinds of experiences, and in its attempts to have something for everyone, it never fully satisfies on any one front."", ""The competitive multiplayer, called The Crucible, is the chief example of this. The few included maps do sport Bungie's hallmark map design - theyre excellent, in fact. But without private lobbies to organize fights with friends, or any ways to customize the handful of game modes, its hard to imagine the multiplayer shooter enthusiast who could be satisfied with it."", ""The same can also be said of how Destiny allows players to interact with one another - or rather, how it doesn't. Bungie calls Destiny a shared-world shooter, and the influences from the MMO world are clear in its overall layout and structure. Yet, theres no way to communicate with anyone who isn't in your party, and there's no loot-trading either. Omissions like these become a big problem when you try to do the challenging weekly Heroic Strike missions and raids. Both are part of a healthy endgame, post-launch content plan thats already delivered enjoyable new modes of play. The first raid, Vault of Glass, has given me plenty of incentive to grind for gear and further develop my character post-campaign. It introduces team objective elements to the PvE, and delivers entirely new locales and bosses that you won't get to see anywhere else in the game world."", ""The problem is, unlike Destiny's other co-op content, neither the Heroic strikes or raids provide matchmaking service, so unless I happen to have high-level friends who are ready to play, finding a party comes down to hitting message boards to look for a group. As someone who played mostly solo, I actually appreciated this sense of separation between me and other players, but people seeking a strong sense of community simply wont find it here. Why do I need an internet connection for a game that feels so intent on putting barriers between me and other players?""]",IGN
220,Velocity 2X,2-Sep-14,Vince Ingenito,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/02/velocity-2x-review,"['While whizzing through the same level for the tenth time, trying to grab every rescue pod, and destroy every enemy while keeping the accelerator pinned, it dawned on me. Velocity 2X is the best Sonic game to come out in two decades. Much like the Blue Blur once did, Velocity 2X takes an established genre and injects it with equal parts speed and ingenuity. It skillfully uses its well-thought-out mechanics to lay out a clear path to mastery, and walking it gave me a near-constant sense of gratification.', 'Velocity 2X is both a vertically scrolling shmup and a side-scrolling action-platformer where you blow up nearly everything you cant pick up, and speed is the highest virtue in the land. Like its predecessor, it disguises itself as a traditional vert-scroller, but once youre tele-dashing into the heart of enemy formations and slinging smart bombs in every-which direction with the right stick, any feelings of familiarity will dissipate. Along with its near-constant focus on speed, these elements make Velocity 2X far more dynamic than your garden variety space shooter.', 'Velocity Ultra veterans will have an easy time slipping back into the cockpit of the Quarp Jet. Everything was right where I left it, as were the responsive controls. I hadnt in any way expected the new on-foot side-scrolling sections to match that level of fluidity, but somehow, developer FuturLab did it. Thanks to the mirroring of key functions from the vertical sections, like boosting and tele-dashing, the platforming sections feel like solving a new set of problems with a pleasantly familiar box of tools.', 'This makes the on-foot action feel like a natural extension of the space-shooting rather than an interruption of it. It also gives Velocity 2X a surprisingly coherent sense of place for an arcade shooter, a feeling reinforced visually by stark lines and notably improved lighting. Nearby explosions bathed my ship in a warm glow, and airlock walls pulsed with light as I gunned down swarms of enemy drones.', 'On the whole, levels are laid out more intelligently than before, allowing for smoother, more rhythmic speed runs. There are still a few puzzle-based levels that focus on navigating branching paths of security locks, and, as in Velocity Ultra, they break up the ordinarily breezy pace of play in unpleasant ways.', 'Where most of the level designs in Velocity 2X make impeccable use of your ships versatility and maneuverability, these ones amount to little more than tangled, incoherent knots that have you yanking at whatever strand looks the loosest until, somehow, it comes undone. Its a structure thats brought into the side-scrolling areas as well, requiring you to stop dead in your tracks and carefully toss a personal teleporter over obstructions in order to proceed. These brief moments of tedium are the only real stumbling points to be found though, and thankfully theyre few and far between.', 'The new boss battles serve as effective final exams, keenly melding Velocity 2Xs various mechanics with a splash of bullet hell rather than making them like the giant damage-sponges youd see in more traditional shmups. And while the 50 stages are noticeably easier to complete than those of Velocity Ultras, scoring a perfect rating is as much of a feat as ever.']",IGN
221,Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds,21-Aug-14,Colin Moriarty,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/21/phantom-breaker-battle-grounds-review,"[""I was disappointed almost immediately after I started playing Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds. This freshly localized Japanese beat-em-up (one of the very first Phantom Breaker appearances in the west) is fun in short bursts, but it's also profoundly imbalanced and excessively button-mashy."", ""I was surprised by how easily I plowed through enemies and bosses alike; I played the entire campaign on normal difficulty by myself in under two hours, and I didn't die once. So I started again on hard difficulty and, a few stages in, realized that the situation hadn't changed much, especially because I was given access to my buffed-out character from my previous playthrough. Button mashing may not be the most egregious charge to level against a game like this, but the best in the genre -- Double Dragon, Castle Crashers, TMNT, and the like -- are far more strategic, and virtually all of them are more of a challenge."", 'Battle Grounds story is also a letdown. Its long-winded, confusing, and unimportant. A few stages in, I used my freshly practiced button-mashing skills just to get through dialogue and back into the action. Purists who want to engage with the plot will like that the original (albeit limited) Japanese voice tracks are intact; then again, unless quite a bit is lost in the translation, I cant imagine this story is worth following in any language.', ""The characters you have to select from are all nicely designed and animated, but the way they play makes them somewhat indistinguishable from one another. I did enjoy the adventure's various locales, however, which were vividly colored and drenched in an old-school aesthetic we don't see much of these days. Likewise, enemy designs were strange, but fittingly so, and I was impressed by the visual variety of opponents I was pitted against."", ""When in combat, Phantom Breaker plays like many other beat-'em-ups, but there's a special twist. Typically, beat-'em-ups are side-scrollers with depth-of-field that can be taken advantage of on the fly. That is to say, you're not only going left or right; you're also moving up and down as you traverse city blocks, hallways, and all the rest. However, this can sometimes be confusing; it's sometimes not always clear if you're lined up properly with an enemy, and this can cause some frustration. Battle Grounds does away with this by having you use the Vita's left trigger to jump back and forth between planes. So you can jump into the foreground, and then into the background, and then back into the foreground again, laying waste to your enemies in both fields at your leisure. Your foes can do the same, adding to a dynamic fighting style that sets it apart from many of its contemporaries."", '', 'Hit the same button over and over again.', ""Unfortunately, for as interesting as some of the environments you work your way through are, and for as unique as the aforementioned combat approach is, Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds just isn't very fun. Virtually every enemy you encounter is nothing but fodder. Even the big, hulking mini-bosses don't pose much of a problem, an issue compounded by a leveling system that rapidly overpowers your characters. I actually loved how I could control the growth trajectory of my character, increasing her offensive and defensive prowess and speed, and even fill out a multi-tiered skill tree, but theres a significant balance issue at the heart of Battle Grounds that made every upgrade in power a downgrade in entertainment value."", 'Battle Grounds is rounded out by online play options, but there, too, I had issues. Mainly, its a virtual dead zone. I ran into one person organically when looking for a partner, but immediately had game-ending connection problems. After soliciting some folks on Twitter, I found another person to play with, and while I got through an entire stage with him, connection issues were as persistent as they were obnoxious. You could play ad-hoc with a friend, though I havent been able to test if this will fully mitigate all connection issues.']",IGN
222,Micromon,8-Aug-14,Scott Thompson,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/08/micromon-review,"[""Here's the logic: Pokemon is fun because of its complex and strategic creature-battling gameplay, simple but endearing story, and colorful graphics. Micromon is a shameless but competently made copy of Pokemon, so Micromon is fun for all those same reasons. It earns no points for originality or unique personality, but... it's basically Pokemon on your iPad, so that's not bad."", ""Im surprised at just how brazen Micromon is in its aping of Pokemon. Not only does it borrow the fundamental mechanics of exploiting innate weaknesses of monster types and leveling a team up, it also makes very little effort to develop any sort of reason for making cutesy creatures kill each other. The best it's got: A quirky researcher wants you to collect data on Micromon, powerful trainers must be overcome in each town, and a nefarious organization attempts to impede progress throughout. I think I pulled a muscle while shaking my head in disbelief of the copy-and-paste story."", 'When Micromon does attempt to differentiate itself, the results are all over the place. The big change-up is in type weaknesses, and most of them are confusing. In Micromon, fire beats wind, wind beats rock, and rock beats water. Not only are these weaknesses the opposite of those in Pokemon, they also dont really make much sense in general. I found myself constantly struggling to remember which monster to use when. Considering everything else that is straight-up copied, this is a weird and unnecessarily confusing change. It feels like the developers just made a mistake.', 'There is one new mechanic that I absolutely enjoy though, and thats the ability to customize a monsters moves on the go. Instead of permanently forgetting a move to learn a new one, Micromon retain all of their skills, letting you decide which four to equip at any time. So, if you have a fire-type Micromon going up against a trainer using all fire-types, you can swap out your fire moves (which would do minimal damage) and instead equip normal attacks. Afterward, you can change everything back quickly and easily. Its such a smart, simple way to make your virtual monsters more versatile. More than that, it opens up the ability to experiment with different skills without permanent consequence.', ""As you'd expect, Micromon uses microtransactions, but thankfully they are completely unobtrusive. While you can use real money to purchase in-game currency (used to buy normal items like potions and revives as well as chances to win super-unique Micromon) you can earn enough money to get by just through battling wild monsters and trainers. Plus, the paid content isnt constantly thrust upon you; the option is always there, but never forced or required."", 'The Micromon themselves are appropriately cute, and even manage to be less ridiculous-looking than some of the more recent Pokemon -- Im looking at you, Klefki. Capturing, evolving, and battling the more than 100 monsters effectively scratches that Pokemon itch, and I quickly found myself trying to find and collect all the different Micromon. After 10 hours or so, though, the lack of new mechanics or interesting story developments left me bored and unmotivated to go on.', ""Breaking up the monotonous story is the ability to battle online against friends or strangers, which is made easy thanks to iOS. In less than 15 seconds, you can go from playing the campaign to engaging in online combat. Winning matches online rewards you with points that can be used on special items and Micromon. That would be a great way to encourage playing against others, except that the matchmaking system is pretty lousy right now. Id say about half my matches were against opponents with monsters at levels nearly twice those of my own. Its hard to actively compete before reaching the endgame right now, so until that's improved I can't recommend playing online.""]",IGN
223,Counterspy,19-Aug-14,Colin Moriarty,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/19/counterspy-review,"[""It seems strange -- even counter-intuitive -- but as one of my history professors used to say, learning history is five percent memorizing dates, times, and other facts, and 95 percent interpreting what you actually think happened. It's hardly a science. That's why CounterSpy, a PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation Vita side-scrolling espionage game from developer Dynamighty hit home with me, at least when it comes to its bold subject matter. It makes no biased judgments, and it chooses no winners and losers. The real threat of nuclear war was perpetually scary, yet CounterSpy makes light of the era in unique ways by focusing on the Cold War's overall absurdity. "", ""CounterSpy may take place during the heart of the Cold War, but unlike most historical fiction written by the victors, it hates both sides equally. It refuses to even call the opposing nations by their actual names. Instead, the Americans are the Imperialists and the Soviets are the Socialists. This is a not-so-subtle ode to the way the two sides thought about one another, and it's an ingenious way to reduce decades-long smoldering into tight caricatures."", '', 'Slinking through the desert.', ""This approach is taken to its zenith by forcing us into a third, unforeseen party known as C.O.U.N.T.E.R. Cleverly, this shadowy organization allies itself with neither side. Instead, its goal is what (in hindsight) any reasonable person shouldve been doing during that time: sabotaging the Imperialists' and Socialists' nuclear programs before they inevitably destroy each other (and the entire planet). "", 'CounterSpy does a great job of nailing the look and sound of its setting, at least in terms of how those of us who didnt live through it think it all looked and sounded. Heavily inspired by the likes of James Bond and countless other Cold War-esque novels, comics, movies, and TV shows, its art and sound direction are its strongest points, especially because of how much they contribute to giving CounterSpy a real feeling of place and time.', ""Less powerful -- though still fun -- is its gameplay. In this regard, this side-scroller seems to have been most influenced by the Metroidvania school of design, though its take is heavily reductive. Instead of giving us sprawling complexes to explore for hours, CounterSpy opts to provide bite-sized mini-maps that can be completed in 10 or 15 minutes each. (The entire experience shouldn't take more than three or four hours to complete.) Each stage is procedurally generated -- a nice touch considering you'll be playing on these otherwise-tiny maps over and over again -- and each level is littered with collectibles to find, including all-important Launch Plans you need in order to shut down both sides nukes."", ""This approach is brilliantly heightened by CounterSpys procedural nature, and how both sides' complexes change on the fly to give you different experiences. For instance, one foray through an Imperialist base might net you three Launch Plans (if you can find them, that is), as well as some weapons blueprints and some cash. But if you opt to go after the Socialists instead, you may get a ton of money, a weapons blueprint, some skill formulas... and only a single Launch Plan."", '', 'Shhhh!', ""Balancing these two conflicting goals -- making your character stronger or forcing your way to the endgame -- isnt necessarily essential in CounterSpy, because you can actually have it both ways, or simply go in one direction or the other. This choice isn't at the core of what makes CounterSpy tick, but it's there, and it's a nice touch. Unfortunately, the more you play through these procedurally generated maps, the more CounterSpy's sometimes glaring problems come to the forefront and test your patience."", ""CounterSpy's special gameplay hook is its ever-changing perspectives. It's a side-scroller until you pop into cover, at which point your perspective will shift to an over-the-shoulder perspective, showing you terrain that you couldnt see from the side. This is a really lovely idea that, for the most part, works well, but CounterSpy's controls can be awfully finicky. Aiming can be a bit of a chore, especially since you can't reveal yourself to enemy soldiers for very long or you'll be seen. I found myself, at times, in obnoxious control loops as I tried to come into and out of cover or attempted to engage in some heated firefights, which are never as fun as simply sneaking around. In short, gunplay could certainly be better. It's not broken -- or even bad -- but it's not nearly as tight and responsive as I would have liked, regardless of which weapon is being used. (If you're curious, the silenced Diplomatic Pistol was typically my go-to, as it was nice and quiet, allowing me to pop some enemy heads without anyone hearing blasts.)"", ""Speaking of the Diplomatic Pistol, I was a fan of not only CounterSpy's set of weapons and skills, but of working my way through various environments to find them. Concocting full blueprints and formulas from disparate parts made me feel like I was accomplishing something special in a sort of metagame, and it gave me a real sensation of power when I could equip better weapons and more useful skills."", '', 'Destruction.', ""Unfortunately, having to go back to maps over and over again, especially when things ramped up in difficulty near the end, exposed CounterSpy's frustratingly inconsistent AI. I was puzzled as to why sometimes enemies spotted me and other times they didn't, especially when I was basically doing the same moves over and over again. There was no predictability to the experience, which caused its fair share of annoyances. This is an issue for a stealth game."", ""What's most frustrating about these AI problems is that it conflicts with an otherwise brilliant mechanic in CounterSpy, which revolves around its DEFCON meter. This meter, which ranges from one to five, is affixed to the individual sides, and goes up or down depending on how stealthily and successfully you've worked your way through previous stages. I absolutely adored this idea, because it gave weight and consequence to how you did previously, and it could make or break how you'd be doing in the present. But with so much of it contingent on occasionally finicky controls and inconsistent AI, keeping your DEFCON counter in check required more patience than skill. And that bummed me out.""]",IGN

There are certainly moments of swash-buckling adventure, but when it comes to its item and skill systems, its roughly as coherent as a rum-drunk buccaneer. Combine that with a flat story that rarely deviates from expectations, and youre left with an experience thats fun in spurts, but ultimately tedious and empty.', ""There's really not much to Risen 3's campaign; you'll visit islands, run errands, join one of three magic-wielding factions, and close demonic portals that threaten your soul and the world at large. While that seems like a lot, the 20-plus hour-long campaign drags on with few surprises, shifts in mood, or character development. After helping many NPCs there will be no other interactions of note, which is a shame because the voice acting for Risen 3's primary cast is nothing if not memorable. Occasionally, it's because of an annoyingly delivered line or a shoddy animation, but usually, its because of inspired performances like the snarky unnamed lead, or a weird sidekick named Bones who channels a mix of James Mason and Christopher Walken."", 'However, the true stars of Risen 3, at least from a visual design standpoint, are the wildlife and their surroundings. In spite of the environments being too cluttered with items I never had any use for, each of the islands houses a variety of landmarks that provide distinct personality, like the Guardian Mage island that also includes a lush forest, a haunted coast, and deep mines populated by dwarves. No matter where I was, the wildlife will grabbed my attention, from the angry gorillas and warthogs that attack on sight to more peaceful fauna like ducks and monkeys.', ""Like its story, Risen 3's combat is also competent, but background elements will test your patience. Swordplay is simple, yet diverse, with a mix of gun and melee attacks, as well as spells of two varieties; those  infused onto your arm for melee attacks or cast from afar via hotkeys. When you're fighting various wildlife as well as demonic forces, the combat works well due in no small part to an AI ally watching your back when there's a group of foes. However, there are two boss battles that completely shift the dynamic in an unfair way by pitting you alone against a foe that spawns limitless cronies while also regenerating its own health. These are the only two boss battles mind you, so as fun as it is to swing a sword, the rest of Risen 3's rank and file grow a bit tedious to take on."", ""Getting combat-ready is mostly a chore, as Risen 3 eschews traditional RPG stores in favor of making almost every NPC an item vendor or skill trainer. For the former, it's nearly impossible to remember who stocks what and where they are. The map does indicate which skills each NPC can train you in, but not the prerequisites needed to learn them. These skills include various crafting forms, many of which require items that aren't marked as being ingredients, which leads to a reluctance to sell anything."", ""If there's one of Risen 3's role-playing elements worth praising, it's the Glory experience system. Instead of making you choose improvements when your overall level increases, you can increase certain attributes when you have enough Glory. You can evenly distribute and constantly improve, or save up and become a dominant swordfighter, gunman, or mage by allocating points to afford the amount of Glory that increases with each upgrade. Instead of the slow grind to leveling up, shooting towards smaller goals helps make Risen 3 feel like a little bit less of a grind."", '', 'This is my BOOMSTICK!', ""While sea travel in Risen 3 consists mostly of pointing-and-clicking your next destination, there's a few encounters at sea that offer a nice change of pace. You might be disarming explosives dropped on your ship, engaging in ship-to-ship firefights, or taking on sea creatures as you steer the ship and fire your cannons. It would have been nice to try out these unique fights at your own pace, but unfortunately, they're annoyingly bunched together during a series of travel sequences and then stop appearing altogether before long. Like the rest of Risen 3, it can be enjoyable, but it's presented in a way thats off-putting and unrefined.""]",IGN

You will have only a hazy sense of purpose; the real goal is to simply delight in interaction. Cause and unexpected effect.', ""To that end, Hohokum is a huge success. Yes, its deliberately obtuse  you wont always know when there are puzzles and when things should be taken at face value, and yes, the loading times could be improved  as could the frame rate, which hitches occasionally - but its also overflowing with personality and a steady stream of delightful surprises. And it's as wonderful on Vita as it is on PS3 and PS4 - just make sure you have a good pair of headphones to get the most out of the fantastic soundtrack."", '', 'This sequence is particularly surreal. Two words: magic beans.', 'Hohokum is one of those games that could only have been created by a small team, so distinct are the voices within the presentation and design. Artist Richard Hogg, in particular, deserves high praise. Every environment is striking yet distinct, and layered with expressive animations and flourishes. Hohokum is less playable while zoomed in, but youll want to do so anyway, just to catch the little touches  the hitchhikers raising their umbrellas when you pass through a waterfall, or the frenzied dancing at the conclusion of the wedding, as fireworks light the night sky.']",IGN
226,Siesta Fiesta,7-Aug-14,Scott Thompson,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/07/siesta-fiesta-review,"['While the enduring retro-revival movement has been mostly focused on recapturing the glory of the 8-bit platformer, Siesta Fiesta proves that there are more great genres to mine for inspiration. Combining the classic gameplay of Breakout with scrolling levels that would feel right at home in something like Rayman, Siesta Fiesta effectively pays tribute to the arcade classic while still managing to inject plenty of new ideas of its own.', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', 'Advertisement', 'Siesta Fiesta feels immediately familiar. Using the touchscreen, circle pad or d-pad to slide your paddle (or bed, in this case) around the bottom of the screen seems purely inspired by Breakout. The touchscreen, specifically, provides a precise and tactile feel, which made it my control method of choice. The same strategies of letting the ball hit the edges or middle of the paddle to send it hurtling in the direction you desire still apply as you clear out bricks and earn high scores. While the brick-busting gameplay is nothing new, what sets Siesta Fiesta apart from Breakout is its use of scrolling levels.', 'Rather than relying strictly on single screens where you must clear out all the pinata bricks (though there are still a few of these), most of these levels scroll from left to right. The bright and colorful levels are surely inspired by platformer stalwarts like Donkey Kong and Rayman; they are full of life, with bizarre characters humming falsetto harmony to the music and neat effects like being completely shrouded in shadows from the setting sun. Each world also incorporates new hazards, like moving fans that blow the ball askew and switches that must be hit to make the pinata bricks appear. Each of Siesta Fiestas 60-plus levels provides its own unique challenges.', 'Another interesting changeup is Siesta Fiestas power-ups. Rather than randomly appearing, like in Arkanoid, power-ups are strategically placed and are essential to destroy all the pinata bricks. Grabbing a Flame Time power-up, for example, will let your slumbering Siesta ball instantly burn through bricks, including those that normally take up to three hits to destroy  but if it touches water, the power-up is gone. I found effectively using and protecting each power-up to be a rewarding challenge in and of itself.', 'All of these variables force quicker reactions, as youll only get a few cracks at eliminating all the bricks on screen before they are gone and you move on to the next set. The scrolling levels are built around the idea of limited time, and end up feeling like a series of tiny puzzles.', 'The creative level design makes Siesta Fiestas ball-bouncing gameplay feel much less random than other Breakout games, and I was able to destroy more and more pinata bricks as I replayed levels and mastered their individual challenges. Racking up a high score takes finesse, and getting the gold medal in each stage will require downright perfection. The only real downside here is the lack of leaderboards and StreetPass functionality. While you can always post screenshots to Miiverse, immediately seeing and competing with your friends scores could have provided further impetus for mastering Siesta Fiestas great levels.', 'Breaking up the strict scrolling and bouncing level design are special paddles and boss battles. The different paddles--which include a fan that lets you carefully blow the ball around and a can that catches and launches the ball--change the fundamental gameplay in fun ways while allowing for new, unique challenges within their levels. The boss battles, on the other hand, often require a mastery of the skills learned in previous levels. These end up feeling a little anticlimactic, though, as the bosses dont attack or impede you in any way. They just sort of move around until you finally hit them enough.']",IGN
227,Tales of Xillia 2,15-Aug-14,Colin Moriarty,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/15/tales-of-xillia-2-review,"[""I always experience a tangible feeling of sadness and remorse when I'm done with a good Japanese role-playing game. Unlike so many other genres, they ask players to spend dozens of hours with them to complete, and when you play a good one for long enough, you get caught up in its world and characters. So when it's all over, it's like closing a good book that took you 50 hours to read. You didn't really want it to end, but it did anyway. 2013's Tales of Xillia was one such JRPG, a game I really enjoyed spending time with, getting to know, and ultimately beating and leaving behind with a heavy heart."", ""In most respects, PlayStation 3's Tales of Xillia 2 -- which is the 14th core Tales game -- is simply more Tales of Xillia, but as a fan of the original, thats exactly what I wanted. Indeed, judged from the periphery, Xillia and Xillia 2 are virtually indistinguishable from one another. They share tons of locations, characters, enemies, graphical assets, music, and sounds. They even share each other's technical benefits and shortcomings, like snappy load times and tons of pop-in. This may seem like a cop-out to some -- and maybe it is -- but familiarity is one of Xillia 2's greatest strengths, allowing players to jump in while cutting through the formalities that aren't needed in a story-driven sequel that assumes players already worked their way through the original."", ""Xillia 2 thrusts players back into the world of Elympios and Rieze Maxia, two territories once separated by a magical barrier that, for thousands of years, obscured them from each other. Representing Rieze Maxia are most of the characters you're familiar with from Xillia: Milla, Jude, Leia, Elize, Alvin, Rowen, and others. Rounding the group out is Xillia 2's main -- and mostly quiet -- protagonist, Ludger, and a young, mysterious little girl named Elle. Theyre both admittedly weaker than the main cast from the original game, and while Ludger is interesting, I have no idea why he was designed to be virtually silent."", ""Elle, on the other hand, only takes part in the story, and not in combat, which lessened my attachment to her. She's essential to the overarching plot, but I always found myself caring about the original cast more, and her subpar voice acting didn't exactly help (nor did Milla's voice actresses' still-disjointed performance, which isn't quite as bad as the original, but still noticeably worse than expert performances from the likes of Alvin's and Rowen's respective actors). Her morbidly obese cat companion Rollo, on the other hand, is absolutely amazing."", ""For as much as Xillia 2 borrows from Xillia, it takes some smart left turns that ultimately keep the experience new, fresh, and on equal footing with the quality of the original. The biggest turn is the deviation away from Xillia's binary campaign progression, which relied a great deal on whether you were playing primarily as Milla or Jude. Xillia 2, on the other hand, is far more linear in its campaign's delivery, instead giving Ludger a litany of decisions to make during conversations and combat alike. The way Ludger works his way through conversations, and who he chooses to pair-up with in battle, can build his affinity with other characters, providing a great reason to carefully navigate Xillia 2's extensive exposition while testing out new match-ups during fights. There's considerable depth to this system, especially since it unlocks new items and conversation options."", '', 'Fighting through time.', ""What remains very much the same, thankfully, is Tales of Xillia's combat, which is alive and well in the sequel. Tales' fighting game-lite, action-oriented combat is the hallmark of the franchise, and while it seems chaotic at first, getting a hang of it is incredibly rewarding. I absolutely love mixing things up in battle, using different special abilities called Artes along with more typical attacks. Ludger even has skills no one else does, including the option to select from three weapon types on the fly mid-fight: blades, war hammers, and guns. This gives Xillia 2 an extra dose of uniqueness, though you'll undoubtedly find yourself using his blades 99 percent of the time."", ""A major change between Xillia and Xillia 2 -- one I'm not completely sold on -- is the abandonment of the Illium Orb for something called the Allium Orb. In Xillia, the Illium Orb was how you'd upgrade your character using points earned by leveling up. This time around, much of that is done for you. Instead, the Allium Orb allows you to equip special items that slowly teach you more Artes and skills the longer you have them equipped in battle. This approach is very reminiscent of Final Fantasy VI's Esper system, though it's far deeper and requires a high level of micro-management, which isn't always fun when already balancing Tales' existing, deep customization systems. I'm glad they tried to change this fundamental aspect of the original, but I definitely preferred the Illium Orb. It was simply less stressful to keep track of."", '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', ""There's more newness to be found. The original Xillia's somewhat random approach to side quests has been replaced with two separate systems that are easier to keep track of, and don't require endless backtracking to places that may or may not bear fruit for you, which was a significant drawback in the first game. The first, lesser system is called Contracts, scores and scores of fetch quests, hunts, and the like that will earn you special points and money, the latter of which is important to pay back a mysterious debt you've incurred at the outset of your adventure. These are easy to keep track of, and they can be accepted in any town in the world. (Jumping in between towns, dungeons, and fields is as easy as using Xillia's snappy quick travel system.)"", ""The deeper, more significant system is the series of character-centric quests that revolve around the members of your party. These meatier, far more substantial quests allow you to build camaraderie with your party members while learning more about them at the same time. I really dug these quests, and enjoyed how they were separated from the primary, chapter-based story that's always waiting to be driven forward in the background."", ""Oh! And then there's Kittie Dispatch, which revolves sending cats you find on item-seeking adventures... but I'll leave you to discover that oddity for yourself."", ""Folks looking for bang for their buck will also be pleased with Xillia 2. I've spent just shy of 40 hours with the game, and I'm still not done. I'm too drawn to all of its ancillary features -- side quests, hunts, Coliseum fighting, leveling my Allium Orbs, earning Tales' famous Titles, and more -- to engage the last couple of dungeons and battles just yet. I can't imagine anyone seeing and doing everything in Tales of Xillia 2 in fewer than 40 hours, and that's being very generous. But if you're playing for Trophies, be wary: all of that time has netted me only three Bronzes. Brutal.""]",IGN

Featuring online-enabled and MotionPlus-enhanced versions of the five original Wii Sports games, Wii Sports Club stands above its predecessor thanks to new and tweaked content.', 'In a lot of ways, Wii Sports Club feels like a remake of the original Wii Sports. I hesitate to call it an HD remake because it is filled with bad textures, boring backgrounds, and a noticeable lack of anti-aliasing. Bowling, Tennis, Boxing, Baseball, and Golf return with all-new training minigames, the ability to play online, and, in some cases, new GamePad functionality. Each sport also makes use of the now-standard Wii MotionPlus, allowing for greater control. With a flick or twist of the wrist, you can get precise spin on your bowling ball or hook your golf ball into the blowing wind. Even having played plenty of Wii Sports Resort, which introduced MotionPlus, Im impressed with how much better the original Wii Sports games play now.', 'A few of the sports see marked improvements over their Wii Sports counterparts. Baseball now features a more robust pitching and fielding mechanic thanks to the GamePad. Using the second screen, you line up your throw with the batters box, choose a pitch, and then adjust the speed. If the batter hits a fly ball, youll need to move the GamePad around in real-space to line your glove up with the ball to make the out. While theres still no ability to handle and throw grounders (they are automatic outs, singles, doubles, or triples), having more control over fielding and pitching makes Baseball more balanced and competitive.', 'Golf, on the other hand, moves closer to emulating the actual sport. Placing the GamePad on the floor, the ball is shown as if its resting on a tee. With the direction the ball will travel and the power of the shot displayed there on the floor, I found that with just a few practice swings I became fairly accurate in my swings. Combined with the ability to twist the remote mid-swing to hook the ball, Golf winds up being a fun simulation thats only lacking the weight of using an actual club (and a mischievous gopher). This move toward more realism does dampen the ability to let newcomers easily jump in at a party, but regular visitors to the virtual links will be rewarded.', 'Unfortunately, there is no saving Boxing. As with the original Wii Sports, these matches wind up feeling chaotic, unresponsive, and mundane. While using a MotionPlus Wii Remote in each hand does allow for better tracking as you block punches to either side of your head, throwing hooks and uppercuts often doesnt register correctly. Frustrated with the inability to play with finesse, matches often boiled down to throwing my arms around wildly and hoping for the best.', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', 'Wii Sports Club: Bowling', 'Wii Sports Club: Bowling', 'Wii Sports Club: Bowling', 'Wii Sports Club: Bowling', '', 'Advertisement', '', 'Wii Sports Club: Tennis', 'Wii Sports Club: Tennis', 'Wii Sports Club: Tennis', 'Wii Sports Club: Tennis', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'Besides Boxing, each of Wii Sports Clubs games are still a blast to play locally. Online play, however, provides some very glaring issues. The slower-moving games, like Bowling and Golf, become an absolute bore thanks to a lack of in-game communication. With no voicechat, youre resigned to using (and often spamming) a small handful of generic phrases like soooo close and nice! as you watch complete strangers bowl. With a rather generous time limit for each turn, a game of bowling with four players winds up feeling like an eternity.', 'Meanwhile, without faile, every game of Golf I played featured someone who skipped the tutorial. The rest of our Miis had to stand there, blank-faced, as the novice continually knocked the ball out of bounds on the very first hole until, mercifully, he was disqualified until the next one. To make matters worse, it is impossible to quit an online game in progress; the only way to release yourself from the torment is to shut the Wii U down completely.', 'Thankfully, these issues dont extend to the action-focused Tennis and Baseball. Tennis, in particular, became a favorite in my home. With online doubles matches, my wife and I cheered and yelled while performing backhand, forehand and overhand smash gestures to eliminate our random opponents. Even playing without a co-op partner, Tennis is a lot of fun and is easily the most rewarding of the five sports to play online.']",IGN
229,Firefall,12-Aug-14,Leif Johnson,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/12/firefall-review,"['Two people who saw my screen during my time in Firefall assumed I was on yet another Borderlands 2 DLC adventure on Pandora. ""I wish,"" I said. Firefall never manages to approach the same level of fun. The elements of a great free-to-play MMO shooter are all in place here  features like exploration, multiple classes, PvP, and dynamic events  but in each case Firefall falls short and stumbles into a mire of mediocrity. Tedious repetition seeps into every aspect of its design.', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'The action unfolds on a future version of Earth where an alien substance called the Meld"" has drenched the planet as thoroughly as the paint on the Sherwin-Williams\' logo. The last scraps of habitable land we\'re fighting for are open-world versions of the lush and geographically diverse vistas of Brazil and Hawaii, which at least provides a visually interesting backdrop for Firefalls bland action.', ""Combat usually benefits from fast action and some strategy from using your boot rockets to bounce out of the way of attacks, but the abilities from the 16 battleframes that represent classes tend to play the same regardless of level. I spent much of my time with Firefall as a bullet-spongy Dreadnaught, and I was initially drawn to the way Firefall drops abilities with better stats in much the way a traditional MMO drops gear and weapons. But here's the thing  the stats never change the feel of the abilities themselves; they just make them hit harder or last longer. It ruins much of the fun of finding new stuff."", ""Multiple classes exist, and you can switch out your battleframes (and thus your class and role) at any time. The only catch (and it's a doozy) is that you'll have to level each battleframe from scratch. Sixteen levels in, I decided I'd probably prefer the advanced Rhino or Mammoth forms of my core Dreadnaught frame, but I balked at the thought of braving the seemingly endless barrage of samey quests and dreary treks for hours again. Shared abilities yield some incentive to tough it out anyway, but leveling both frames is a time investment that Firefall never compels me to make."", ""Making matters worse is the bland, repetitive quest structure. Almost without deviation, Firefall's quests involve jogging to a job board and sprinting out to a spot two miles away to kill five to 10 dudes. Sometimes it doesn't even have the decency to let you shoot something when you get there. After that, it's time to sprint back. There are exceptions: sometimes you'll plant bombs, sometimes you'll (ugh) escort an occasionally bugged NPC, but even after just five hours the appeal of this design starts to wear thin."", ""Travel, indeed, is one of Firefall's great failings. Even having access to paid-for rumbly motorcycles and heavy trucks (you'll need to wait until level 25 to unlock one for free), the drudgery of the cross-terrain runs started to settled in. Had I not had my vehicles, I'm not sure I would have wanted to continue leveling at all."", ""An option to focus on more than one quest at a time might have helped relieve the tedium of this design, but Firefall's heavily voiced questlines prevent it. When quests are granted it triggers fully voiced conversations that play as you blast on rocketboots to your next objectives. If the quests were actually interesting, I mightve appreciated that you can enjoy the story on the go instead of standing around reading a big block of quests."", ""At least Aero, our Latin-accented guide back at base, is ably voiced by Laura Post. She manages to bring personality to the role that I enjoyed listening to even after hours upon hours of play. The catch? Firefall's relentless tendency to to single out your character as a named individual  Ares 35  creates the same kind of clash between single-player story and multiplayer gameplay that so rattled me in The Elder Scrolls Online."", 'Dynamic events ease some of the repetition, but they\'re fairly scarce and repeated scenarios start to pop up almost as soon as you discover them. A ""wounded"" bandit might call on you for help before springing his buddies on you, a large mining device called a ""thumper"" might need repair, or  these are my favorite  swirling Meld tornadoes might pop up and trigger gateways to other dimensions were crafting materials wait by the truckload. One of Firefall\'s best ideas is the ability to create you own little dynamic events with the help of a personal thumper that pummels mats like iron out of the ground, attracting monsters and (hopefully) other players who\'ll jump in for secondary awards.', ""For now, at least, that's the majority of what you'll find in Firefall aside from a couple of raid bosses waiting and an open world PvP zone at what passes for the end game. There's also an open-world PvP arena you'll find at a questing hub several hours in, but it's a smallish thing that resembles little more than a neglected skate park in a tropical city. It's almost always empty."", 'The other trouble with Firefall is that it demands time investments at every turn, particularly if you have any plans to play largely for free. Firefall enjoys an otherwise agreeable free-to-play model that stocks its store with convenience items such as experience boosts, cosmetic items, and advanced battleframes, but the in-game currency of crystite drops far too infrequently to make acquiring the same stuff for free anything but a soulless chore. And just to restate: the fact that you have to pay for a vehicle to circumvent all the early travel  is a terrible idea.']",IGN

Taking the unit management and base building from a real-time strategy game and the constant base push of a MOBA, AirMech stands as an interesting hybrid with some fun modes and a fair free-to-play structure. All that makes it especially disappointing that the multiplayer servers dont work.', ""Like virtually all MOBAs and many RTS games, AirMech Arena is primarily built as a  multiplayer game -- which is unfortunate, because its servers dont work properly. In every mode, when starting a match with other humans -- even as a spectator -- I almost always experienced server connection issues (and had others report the same). Single-player modes naturally dont see this issue, but theyre not as fun or as challenging because bots aren't nearly as creative as human opponents. This alone makes it difficult to recommend, even though it does some cool stuff."", 'AirMech Arena shares simple yet fun mechanics across its modes: swiftly transform between a cool, cartoony aircraft and a mech, construct bases, and build and transport units around the map to attack the enemy base. Learning these fundamentals is quick and easy, especially because the controls make ordering any one of over 60 types of tanks, mechanized foot soldiers, and other specialized units simple. Directing the units with the D-pad to stand guard, advance on an enemy base, or patrol an area can be a little tedious, as it requires you to assign the units task before its deployed or fly over to it and pick it up off the ground to change its assignment.', 'Strangely, the top and bottom portions of the HUD were cut off. (I tried two different TVs, and no menu option to fix it was available.) It was still playable, but it wouldve been nice to see my level progress bar and a portion of my fortress health bar.', ""Theres plenty of satisfying strategy to dig into. Deciding when to focus efforts on building units as an aircraft and when to get involved on the front lines as a mech is exciting. When you're losing control of the map, sometimes it's best to build a ton of turrets around your base, transform to mech mode, and mow down enemy waves. Going on the offensive, you can let your automated defenses hold the line while you build and transport tons of heavy-hitting tanks to the doorstep of an enemy base."", 'A here-is-how-to-walk tutorial is available in the menu, but by default youre immediately dropped into the much more interesting Challenge mode. Over 15 single-player levels, it effectively schooled me in building units, finding the best tactic for capturing bases, and taking down opponents.', 'After that, I was ready to go into real combat. The other two modes each have their own feel, which kept me interested in purchasing new units to adapt to the modes. Skirmish requires a balanced loadout of units to push across the map to the enemy base, and can be played with up to three players on each team. Survival has up to four players and borrows from tower defense games in its winding maze of maps. It requires units that can handle large waves of enemies, such as the the larger tanks and turrets, instead of the foot soldiers that are helpful in capturing bases which arent as helpful in protecting your base.', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', 'In Skirmish its easy to tell when your tactics outmatch an opponents, and that feels great. By focusing my efforts on quickly capturing bases with smaller units instead of slowly building up an army of tanks, I gain map control early on in the game. But when theyre one step ahead of you, its still satisfying to figure out new ways to use your loadout of units and turn the match in your favor.', 'The dynamic changes when teammates are introduced in the co-op mode. Discussing objectives with teammates is important to know which units to build and where to take them. Unlike a MOBA character, pilots dont have direct support or carry roles, or special abilities. Instead each pilot is differentiated by a small bonus, such as faster unit build times or AirMech speed, so teamwork is important to build an effective strategy, which can be a little annoying if your teammates dont cooperate.', 'The variety of maps and number of teammates you choose to play with changes the dynamic of each match even more. AirMech Arena emphasizes the importance of adapting your strategy to each game you play, and that keeps the gameplay interesting. All of the modes, online or offline, earn XP for your account and Kudos, one of the in-game currencies.', 'As a free-to-play game, the item store is a focal part of AirMech Arena, and the developer makes that obvious. Instead of a pushy campaign for your money with popups or unreasonable prices on microtransactions, Carbon Games campaign for your money is in the controllers Back button. By pressing it in one of the menus, you are instantly transported to a storefront that has purchasable units, pilots, AirMechs, skins, and other cosmetic items. While most AirMechs and units can be purchased with the earnable Kudos, keys for random item drop boxes and premium cosmetic items, such as the jetpack cat that follows your AirMech around the map, require at least some form of payment.

Except on this test, every time you get an answer wrong the professor executes someone you care about in cold blood. And youre not wearing pants.', 'Do I recommend it? Absolutely.

Yes there is.', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'In most respects - perhaps too many - Xenonauts is the X-COM follow-up we shouldve had in 1998. Structurally, it nails almost all of what makes X-COM my favorite game of all time, and kept me largely happy for the roughly 80 hours Ive played. (An average campaign will take roughly 15 or 20 hours.) Building a base to research and manufacture advanced weaponry on the global strategic level, then using that weaponry to kill aliens in the squad-based tactical mode on randomized, destructible maps and bring back their technology for further development ties the two together in numerous interesting ways. The fact that each of your renamable soldiers is an extremely fragile mortal that can be permanently struck down in an instant by a plasma bolt from the darkness or turned into a zombie with a single touch adds an incredible high-stakes tension. (If someone dies in tactical combat, theyre dead on the strategic layer, too.) So does the way the flexible time unit system puts every step they take in your direct control.', 'Survival requires intense attention to detail and resource management, and almost every decision feels weighty. Should you spend a big chunk of money on a new base to protect more of your funding countries with radar and interceptors to protect your cash flow, or do you hire a large team of scientists and engineers to accelerate your technological development? Do you concentrate on developing weaponry for a strong offense, or tough armor for a strong defense? Xenonauts even gives a few new options for both, with gear like riot shields that make equipping stun batons (for taking enemies alive) less of a suicide mission, and actual shotguns, sniper rifles, and heavy machine guns make arming a soldier to complement his unique stats, like strength, time units (aka speed), and bravery something you have to consider.', 'And yet for an update to a classic that aims to bring that gameplay to a new modern audience, Xenonauts is disappointingly unambitious and unpolished in a lot of ways. For example: its drab-looking, and that criticism has nothing to do with it being a 2D, sprite-based game. Theres some cool concept art showing detailed lizard men and chryssalid stand-ins (called reapers) that youll see in the research and database screens, but the characters on the tactical battlefields are tiny and lacking in personality in both design and animation. Ive been running Xenonauts at 1366x768 and blown it up to fit my 1920x1080 screen - it still doesnt give these tiny sprites anywhere near the character of the big-headed sectoids of old, since theyre still undetailed and mostly bland, but it at least makes them big enough on screen that they feel important.', '', 'They all look like ants from up here.', 'Xenonauts also embraces X-COMs legendary difficulty, though it goes a little overboard by correcting several of the classics favorable imbalances (manufacturing laser rifles for cash, super-powered psi soldiers, and waypoint-programmable Blaster Launchers) without scaling back the alien threat to compensate. Challenge is great, but as someone who beat X-COM: Terror From The Deep on Superhuman (though I did not ironman it), I found Xenonauts punishingly brutal on the Veteran difficulty described as being tuned for people whod played X-COM. Eventually I was forced to turn it down to Normal; even then, its no joke.', 'Getting over the initial hump of catching up to the aliens technologically is a major battle, and avoiding casualties long enough to get some veteran soldiers isnt easy. Losing even one or two experienced troops per mission and having to replace them with green recruits makes it difficult to gain momentum.', 'Its particularly difficult because Xenonauts does a terrible job of telling you important stuff, like whether youre actually benefiting from cover (corners, for example, dont do squat). Its awful at showing you where your annoyingly inaccurate grenade tosses actually land, so you should probably just run in case it landed at your feet. Oftentimes youre shown that you have line-of-sight on an enemy, but cant shoot them for unknown reasons - rounded objects (the landed UFOs) are especially hard to shoot around. When someone gets killed, it doesnt tell you who it was until the end of the mission - it just hides their portrait and makes you use the process of elimination to figure it out.', 'I do like where Xenonauts was going with its entirely original UFO-interception minigame. Its a simple pausable real-time tactics challenge about maneuvering up to three planes on a 2D battlefield, so that your planes remain outside the enemys firing arcs while keeping their targets in their own sights. It doesnt have nearly enough variety or staying power to keep my finger away from that auto-resolve button, however, and about 95 percent of the time an engagement is a foregone conclusion anyway.', '', ""We probably don't need to play this one out."", 'It also brings about the most frequent and annoying information display problem in Xenonauts: after you use an interceptor to shoot down a UFO, it has to return to base to repair, refuel, and rearm before it can attack another UFO. How long does that take? Its hard to say: first it repairs, with an estimated completion in hours. Then it refuels, also in hours. Then it reloads, which is displayed as a percentage. When its done, it doesnt tell you.

The problem comes in recommending it to people who dont have my experience, because they are probably going to have an awful time learning the whole not-getting-massacred thing. Sure, Xenonauts comes with a five-page Quick-Start Guide PDF and a few in-game tooltip pop-ups, but when you compare that to the 133-page X-COM: UFO Defense manual thats basically required reading to understand these basic concepts, its simply inadequate.']",IGN
232,Orbital Gear,21-Aug-14,Chuck Osborn,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/21/orbital-gear-review,"['Simplicity is both a virtue and a vice in Orbital Gears, a 2.5D side-scrolling multiplayer-only shooter armed with an interesting gimmick: the gravitational fields of deep space.', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'The virtue is that, as a giant mech, you run around planets -- quite literally, in this case -- using their gravity to zip around a solar system-sized map, hopping from one world to the next and shooting opponents. The vice is that, well, thats about all there is to it. A paltry two modes, Deathmatch and Orbital Warfare, are included. Deathmatch is self-explanatory; Orbital Warfare is a more strategic team-based affair thats essentially King of the Hill in space.', 'At the outset, youre given full access to all of Orbital Gears 12 weapons and four Utilities, which also sadly means theres no progression system. The weapons will be familiar to anyone whos played a sci-fi FPS over the last 15 years, ranging from pulse rifle and flack cannon to grenade launcher and flame thrower. Many of the weapons seem to have an odd pause between depressing the fire button and discharge, though. While it makes sense for delayed action weapons like the chaingun, an instant-hit weapon like the Discharger suffers from having to tap the fire button twice. My favorite weapons are the grenade launcher, which can be used to exploit a planets gravity by firing bouncing balls of explosive energy onto its surface, and the Hornets gun that fires multiple enemy-seeking missiles at once. As cool as some of these weapons are, it seems like a missed opportunity to not make you work for them.', 'The modestly helpful Utilities are temporary augments that can be activated at any time, coming in the flavors of a shield, speed boost, mines, and an orbiting satellite that fires at enemies. Match wins will come from strategy and skill with your weapons, though, not from this lackluster assortment of relatively weak extras.', 'There arent too many surprises in level layouts, either. The six Deathmatch maps and three Orbital Warfare maps are pretty similar to one another with a couple notable exceptions, such as the Dark map in which all planets except for one glowing gas giant are kept practically invisible due to a lack of light, and the Fusion Core map that gets rid of planets altogether and features a series of girders surrounding what Im guessing is a fusion core. (Thank you, level namer.) They offer some different strategic elements (like camping in the dark), but from my experience most servers tend to stay with the more traditional maps.', 'Another blow against its simplicity is that, while Orbital Gear can be a lot of fun for competitive play, and offers an arena for tense battles (I can see it being adopted by the esports community), the lack of a single-player mode is a problem. Mainly because, even a week and a half after launch, there are at most a small handful of servers available at any one time, and often none whatsoever. Without other people playing, a multiplayer online-only shooter is about as useful as a disconnected telephone.']",IGN

Sure, it's part of a post-apocalyptic future where mutant predators run rampant and the remnants of humankind live in crumbling subway stations masquerading as city-states, but the Metro has a distinct culture, colorful survivors, and haunting secrets that are almost as much fun to discover as they are horrifying. It's also the setting of two games  Metro 2033 (review) and Metro: Last Light (review)  that smartly weave storytelling, stealth, and first-person gunplay into one long, darkly beautiful narrative, and Metro: Redux brings them together in one enhanced package for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. If you've never plumbed the Metro's murky depths (or are itching for an excuse to return), this is a fantastic way to experience them."", 'Metro Last Light HD', 'Metro Last Light HD', 'Metro 2033 HD', 'Metro 2033 HD', 'Metro 2033 HD', 'Advertisement', 'Metro 2033 HD', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', 'Its a journey that takes you through creepy tunnels and ruins haunted by shaggy monsters and eerie phantoms, in which tense moments of stealth or exploration might suddenly give way to explosive, crowded firefights. Here, bullets are currency, guns are ugly and homemade, gasmasks spell the difference between life and death, and everyone calls them ""gosmosks"" in hokey faux-Russian accents. (Also, get ready to hear lots from veteran anime-and-game actor Steve Blum, who lends his gravelly voice to roughly half of the characters.)', ""Thats all unchanged from the original version on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC, but Redux improves on both the graphics and gameplay in significant ways - mostly for the better. It begins with the choice of whether to scuttle through the tunnels in Survival mode  which promises harsher, Metro 2033-esque threats and scarce resources  or storm them with plentiful ammo and faster pacing in the Last Light-inspired Spartan mode. (If you forget which one you chose, just look at your watch  2033's analog model shows up in Survival, while Spartan features Last Light's digital timepiece. This makes no difference gameplay-wise, but it's a nice touch.)"", ""Being able to pick your pace and style of gameplay is a cool feature, although it's worth noting that playing through Metro 2033 on Survival mode in Normal difficulty definitely feels more forgiving than the original, so players looking for a serious challenge should immediately kick it up to Hardcore. In Survival, gasmask filters  which put a timer on your lifespan when you're exploring Moscow's toxic surface streets  were often in short supply, but I never had to use military-grade bullets (which double as currency and powerful last-resort ammunition) until the very end, I never ran out of medpacks, and devastating weapons  like silenced shotguns and Kalashnikovs  were usually within easy reach."", 'Watch our original Metro 2033 review.', ""Then again, part of the reason this new Metro 2033 is easier is that it's no longer tripping over its own feet. Not only do its new character models and brighter lighting make it easier to spot enemies and see detail (at the expense of some of the original's moodiness), but its clunky menus and controls have been ditched in favor of Last Light's more intuitive equipment wheels and Call of Duty-esque handling. That's a big improvement, but the biggest one is that the enemy AI feels more consistent, making it possible to sneak around or stealth-hunt packs of hostile guards without the risk of arbitrarily bringing all their friends crashing toward your exact location once they spot a body. Also, Metro 2033 has been retrofitted with the same little touches that make guard-hunting especially fun (if not particularly challenging) in Last Light  like musical cues that tell you when guards are near, what their alert status is, and when you've scored a kill or are in danger of being spotted."", ""Not all of the battles are as interesting as the stealth opportunities, though. 2033 still loves hurling fistfuls of monsters at you in open areas, particularly in the final levels, where you'll get so badly mobbed that it starts to feel like some level designer went berserk with a rubber-stamp tool when placing them. Those moments fall just short of lasting too long, though, and while it lacks some of the original's tough, dismal charm, Redux is overall a much smoother, more enjoyable, and better-looking way to experience Metro 2033."", 'Watch our original Metro: Last Light review.', ""The same can't be said of Redux's version of Metro: Last Light  but only because Redux doesn't tinker with it nearly as much. As before, Last Light Reduxs gameplay is more exploration-focused and diverse than Metro 2033 (and includes bosses and more overt moral decisions), and it tells a more compelling story that focuses on the Metro's human characters, political intrigues, and supernatural weirdness. It also spends a lot more time above ground, amid Moscow's more dazzling ruined landmarks, and its just as much fun to play through now as it was in 2013, with plenty of monsters to shoot at, lots of opportunities to hunt guards in big environments filled with hiding places, and more side activities to get distracted by."", ""Already a great-looking game, this Last Light is visually a step up from the previous PS3/360 iteration, although Redux's PlayStation 4 and Xbox One editions still arent on par with the 2013 PC version running at high settings  which is disappointing, if not surprising. Actually, both Last Light and Metro 2033 look notably sharper on PC, while PS4 feels like a small visual step down; things like floating particles might not have the same crisp definition, but otherwise I wouldnt notice the difference unless youre looking at them side by side. The Xbox One version, meanwhile, runs in 912p rather than 1080p, making it technically the weakest of the bunch - although each version plays identically, and again, its hard to notice a difference unless youre playing each version one after the other."", ""Console differences aside, Last Light Redux is clearly the definitive version, packing in every single piece of DLC (including the excellent, Dark Souls-esque Kshatriya add-on, set in a freely explorable version of the monster-filled Moscow Library) and even bringing back the ability to get a close-up view of Artyom's watch  an essential tool for knowing how much gasmask time you have left, if you're playing in the HUD-disabling Ranger difficulty mode.""]",IGN

Of course, on the new in-game view of a ball looping lazily out of the park or dribbling to short you can see some of the action, but theres no walk-up music, animated wiggles, and whiffs. Anything that happens that matters is visible in the numbers. So you can speed that process by simulating every half inning, or every inning, or every few innings, or the complete game. But damn if the first time I clicked on the half-inning option and my pitcher gave up a squiggly number did I not vow never to do that again...until I did in the next game, because damn, can these games take time.

Don't get me wrong, Diablo 3 nailed the moment-to-moment combat experience from the get-go, but the reward loop was way off-kilter. With the release of the Reaper of Souls expansion on PC, the somewhat erratic rhythm of its reward and progression cycle steadied into constant thrum. Now, with the Ultimate Evil Edition on PS4 and Xbox One, Diablo 3 takes on its highest form, melding the successes of two years of patching with the positive side-effects of porting to current-gen consoles."", ""Ultimate Evil Edition teems with content. You're getting everything from Diablo 3 and its expansion, Reaper of Souls, including the incredible endless Adventure mode. The raised level cap, reworked skills, and of course that handy fourth passive slot are all here as well, and importing your character from a last-gen console is a breeze, so you won't have to replay a bunch of content you've likely already replayed over and over to experience it. If you're returning from the original console release, you won't miss a beat."", ""If you're a new player, and you don't already know what's in store, just ignore the cheesy story. Diablo 3 is about killing things, all the things, whether alive, undead or inanimate, and seeing what sweet new piece of gear drops so you can kill more, bigger things. Ultimate Evil's excellent analog stick controls, deep bestiary, and varied character classes make that hunt enjoyable both in the short term, and the long haul."", ""A regular stream of upgrades and legendary items means that even over the course of a short, 1-hour play-session, you'll often see your avatar make tangible progress, and by your 200th hour in the endless, infectiously rewarding adventure mode, you'll still be finding ways to eke out ever more power from your character. I can still remember leveling my first character In vanilla Diablo 3 to 60 without crafting a single thing, or even making very many decisions. Starting a new character from scratch really highlighted how much Blizzard has changed for the better."", ""That well-tuned cycle of  violence, profit, and growth is easier on the eyes than ever here too. Last-gen consoles had to make visual sacrifices to run Diablo 3's more heated battles at a respectable frame rate, but on PS4 and Xbox One, no concessions are necessary. At 1080p, and an almost constant 60 fps, the action looks sharp, plays smooth, and is mostly on par with Reaper of Souls on a nice gaming PC. There are very occasional hiccups in framerate during huge battles, and the effects, while greatly improved, aren't quite at max PC levels, it's still a huge step forward from the last console iteration."", ""Finally, Ultimate Evil serves up a few social-minded twists like an in-game mail system to gift loot to friends, and a new nemesis system which allows a monster that slays someone on your friend's list to grow in power and come into your game to give you a chance to avenge your fallen comrade. It's a cute trick, but not a game-changer in any way. The real star is still the ability to play on the couch with up to three friends, tearing through the angry hordes that await you in adventure mode, where the wildly randomized dungeons form the backbone of Diablo 3's endgame."", ' ']",IGN

You should be, because Madden NFL comes out this time every year. Its not a surprise, folks. What is a pleasant surprise is that Madden NFL 15 has turned out to be one of the better years for improvements to EAs long-running football sim.

It looks wonderful on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, too.', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'For years, defensive play in Madden has always been a chore you have to do in between the fun parts where youre trying to score. Things are different this year, and its a hugely important and long-overdue upgrade. Defense now feels impactful, like youre in charge of how things play out instead of just waiting for the offense to mess up.', 'It does this in two ways: first, you have this all-new defensive camera that faces toward the quarterback. You get to stare down your primary objective during pass rush, and race right toward him as soon as the play starts. Fighting your way through the offensive line with the mashing of the face buttons is an exciting charge.', 'Then, if you manage to break free, you actually get to control how your tackle attempt plays out. It isnt just about running at players and hitting them. You can choose to tackle high or low, and even modify the intensity of your hit. Its all contextual and built toward being more realistic. This is increasingly important as the wonky physics system introduced in Madden 13 is still present, though slightly more refined. The only bummer is that this new defensive camera doesnt work in local multiplayer. Thats a pretty big downside, but its a non-issue if you play mainly online.', 'Im also thrilled to see that a new play-calling system has replaced the simplistic suggestions from last year with something that strikes a great balance between complexity and ease of use. Instead of requiring you to dig through menus in-depth or simply handing you a play, Madden NFL 15 uses context to provide helpful play choices. Say youre sitting at First-and-10; itll take statistics for your opponents typical defense in this situation and pair that with your common moves to provide you with the best play options. You can modify these based on what youre looking to accomplish with the play as well, so if you want to take it strategically and not go for the big yards, itll suggest different plays on the fly to help you accomplish that. After years of EA trying out new systems that never seemed to work out, this is one Id love to see stand the test of time.', 'All of my favorite parts of Madden are still around, too, including Connected Franchises and Ultimate Team. Actually, Im more of a fan of the Offline Franchise and wish it wasnt always trying to keep me online and engaging with friends in a fantasy football-like setting. Sometimes its nice to just build out a team and play on my own schedule.', 'Ultimate Team has been slightly revamped to streamline the team-building systems a bit, getting rid of your reserve deck and focusing on your main team. That should be your main priority anyway, so the change works great. Unfortunately the card-pack microtransactions are still here, and still feel a bit gross, as if to capitalize on my impatient nature interacting with the player progression system.', 'Compared to the incremental graphics upgrades seen in  Madden 25, Madden 15 looks significantly more next-gen. Player and uniform textures look dramatically better. Games that take place at night under stadium lighting and in midday shadows look great, especially next to last years blown-out nightmares. Stadiums, too, are notably improved. This is much more like the intensity and hype that a Sunday night game has on TV.', 'Unfortunately, this makes the travesty on the sidelines and in the crowds all the more apparent and noticeable, as the characters seen there continue the trend of looking significantly worse than anyone on the field and repeating every five feet. Every time the camera pans across the sideline, youre sure to see no more than five faces repeated throughout 80 people.

It has a fairly compelling story, too, one that's cleverly delivered without a single word written or spoken. But as a game, one that you play? Another World is anything but good. It reminds me a great deal of how I feel about Dragon's Lair: it's an old, well-remembered game that simply isn't fun. So what's the point of playing it instead of watching a Lets Play?"", 'Another World puts you in the role of Lester, a scientist conducting obviously hazardous experiments in his laboratory. One thing leads to another, and he finds himself stranded on a mysterious planet populated by more enemies than friends.', '', 'Undeniably beautiful.', 'The mysteriousness and ambiance of the alien planet is perhaps the single best aspect of Another World. I really enjoyed how it let me know exactly what was going on without having to actually tell me, and how it leaves things open to interpretation. Scenic queues, audible grunts, and more are a far cry from cutscenes that pull you out of the experience. Another World feels quaint, but this represents the whole of its charm, because none of its delivery is literal.', ""Unfortunately, that charm falls prey to complete frustration literally 30 seconds into the adventure -- and about every 30 seconds thereafter -- when you have to figure out how to use a stiff, rigid, and completely unacceptable control scheme that makes Another World arbitrarily harder than it should be. To be clear, this is not the effect of a botched port; all versions of Another World have this issue. There is nothing worse in games -- and I mean nothing -- than oppressively bad controls. I don't care how good it looks or sounds, and I don't care about how endearing its story is. These are additive qualities. If it's not fun to actually play, what's the point? Another World isn't fun. That's a huge problem."", ""Sometimes you'll want Lester to run, and you'll press that button. Maybe he'll run, maybe he won't. Maybe he'll jump, maybe he won't. Sometimes you'll want Lester to shoot his laser gun, or create a shield, or blast off a powerful shot. It's a crapshoot whether he'll actually do any of that when you tell him to. This creates incredible frustration, especially in Another World's gun battles, which come off as utterly capricious and overly punitive. This isnt about being too hard; the NES Mega Man games are amongst my favorite games of all time, and they're notoriously difficult. But they're difficult through design. Their controls feel great, and that means that when I die, it's no ones fault but my own. I can't say the same about Another World."", '', 'Hey yourself.', ""Still, I can't deny the feeling of accomplishment I got when I worked my way through a stubborn and annoying part of Another World, which is basically every single part of it. I admitted defeat and gave up trying to figure things out on my own early -- lest I throw my Vita out of the nearest window -- and called up a video walkthrough to guide me. But even then, it only dulled the pain. Another World's puzzle design isn't nearly as bad as its controls, but that doesn't necessarily make that design good."", ""And perhaps it's that obtuseness that really is at the core of what makes Another World a bad game. There's nothing inherently wrong with not knowing what to do; in fact, the mystery of an experience and not necessarily knowing what your goals are can be a big part of what makes playing video games -- like reading books or watching movies -- amazing. But when you're expected to interact with something, unlike those books or movies, there has to be a hook. You have to at least feel like you're in control, and that your character will do what you want to him or her to do. Lester walks around like a bag of cement, he shoots his laser gun with no consistency, and he jumps like a 1,000-pound man. Where's the fun in any of that?"", ""If your game lacks good controls -- like Telltales The Walking Dead, for instance -- you had better deliver the goods elsewhere. Even if Another World is pretty and tells an interesting and different kind of story, that's simply not good enough in this case. Go back and play Super Mario Bros. on NES. That's a timeless game.

Metrico isnt a calculus class, and you wont need your TI-89 in order to work your way through complex equations. Numbers simply provide the fuel that makes Metrico run.', 'Unfortunately, for as novel a game as Metrico is, and as outrageously promising as it seemed, the final product doesnt quite meet expectations. This is a truly unique and inspired experience, but its also a technically flawed one, and when Metrico started to stray away from typical controls and towards the PlayStation Vitas motion, camera, and touch functionality, the experience quickly diminished in quality.', 'What I truly love about Metrico is its lack of literal messaging. Youll find and hear nary a word through its 60-plus puzzles spread across six unique worlds, leaving everything up to your own interpretation. Its side-scrolling puzzle solving seems typical, yet its anything but, and its easy to get caught up in the ambience of the world and what it might be trying (or not trying) to tell you. I read into Metrico something heady and meaningful; you may see it an entirely different way. I think thats part of its beauty.', 'Adding to its unique atmosphere is its tranquil soundtrack and subtle noises. When you start Metrico, it uses a graphical cue to push you towards wearing headphones instead of listening to it over the Vitas tiny speakers or, worse yet, playing it on mute, and its good advice. Its masterful audio accompaniment makes Metrico, in turn, a more stimulating visual experience.', 'While the graphics are simple, yet beautiful, and the sound is perfectly fitting, Metrico doesnt run that well. Its framerate stutters noticeably, especially in between puzzles that are supposed to segue seamlessly, and its load times are borderline absurd, especially for a game of this size. Its not technically ambitious, so theres no excuse for what might be, pound for pound, the absolute worst load times I can recall on the Vita (it consistently takes over 30 seconds to load a puzzle from the puzzle select screen, for instance). Additionally, Metrico glitched out on me multiple times, forcing me to restart puzzles. I fell through environments, some puzzle elements wouldnt turn on, and Id die inexplicably. These problems arent around every corner, but in playing almost the entire campaign in one sitting, I did encounter them several times.', '', 'Truly cerebral.', 'When things work, however, solving Metricos puzzles is, at first, straight forward.

Through trial and error, you may realize that every time you jump, that 0/4 becomes 1/4 and then 2/4 until it gets out of your way. Meanwhile, that 0% may go to 100% by walking backwards. The interplay between these elements is truly a breath of fresh air.', 'Deeper into the campaign, however, Metrico gets too crazy for its own good by throwing in way too many elements that take advantage of Vitas functionality, but dont take into account that you might be playing in public, without means to solve certain puzzles. For instance, it uses the Vitas back-facing camera, starting off by asking you to capture light to solve puzzles. Then it demands a certain color light  red, blue, and green  to solve even more puzzles. Its a nice idea, but its incredibly impractical, and reeks of short-sighted design. I had to sit on a couch with a ripped piece of green paper next to me, constantly pointing the camera at the paper, the red rug underneath me, and a blue piece of furniture nearby. What if I was on the train? On a plane? In a car? Playing in bed, in the dark? What would I do then? I could have sworn we learned these lessons with another promising game held back by gimmicks in the form of Sony Bends otherwise excellent Uncharted: Golden Abyss.', 'Metrico also falls prey to poor touch control, something not all that uncommon on the Vita. Youll eventually be given the power to shoot projectiles in order to solve puzzles, but aiming requires the use of finicky back touch controls that frustrated me often.

The fact that theyre included actively walks everything back from greatness.', '', ""Technical issues and gimmicky controls injure Metrico's beauty."", 'With so many ways to interact with an otherwise straight-forward puzzler, more complicated puzzles with lots of elements quickly became exercises in figuring out what to do to the Vita to make everything click. Id shake the Vita to figure out if it was motion-based, Id get up and put the Vita in front of a light to see if the camera had anything to do with it, and Id tap the touch screen for good measure. It all became exhausting after a while. I wanted to immerse myself in Metrico, because its aesthetics and message beg you to do so, but some of its more gimmicky controls are, unfortunately, totally unimmersive.', 'Fortunately, I cant deny that solving all of Metricos puzzles  which took me an afternoon, for the most part  gave me a sense of pride and accomplishment. Some of the puzzles are very complicated and require you to look at things in a totally different way, especially as you get deeper and deeper into it. And I also love the so-called choice you have at the end of the six worlds, where youre given two doors to go through with no explanation whatsoever, with nothing but a graph showing you the decisions other players in the world made (The Walking Dead: The Game-style). Its Trophy roster  full of all hidden Trophies  is also enticing, especially because I only earned a couple of them the entire time I played. Im intrigued by what kind of crazy things you have to do to earn them all.']",IGN
239,Sacred 3,4-Aug-14,Mikel Reparaz,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/04/sacred-3-review,"[""However games evolve, there's still something about frantically mashing buttons in a sea of monsters that never quite gets old. And that's good, because it describes roughly 90 percent of what you do in Sacred 3. Where its predecessors were free-roaming, Diablo-style action RPGs, Sacred 3 is a mostly linear, four-player, fixed-camera hack-and-slasher in the vein of Gauntlet, focused on little more than the simple fun of smashing through waves of baddies and collecting the piles of gold that fly out of their violently ragdolling corpses. It's an approach that could easily turn dull, but Sacred 3 injects it with just enough challenge and variety to keep the action entertaining."", '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', 'As one of four improbably powerful heroes  Marak, a hulking warrior who wields a giant hammer and fire magic; Claire, a winged paladin with air-based spells who swings her sword in wide arcs; Alithea, a quick fighter with a spear and earth-based abilities; and Vajra, who can unleash ice spells in addition to a constant stream of arrows  your job is to defeat the monstrous armies of an evil warlord named Zane, who\'s trying to conquer the land of Ancaria. Most of this boils down to hammering a single button to slash at gremlins, zombies, and orc-like grimmocs, which is satisfying enough. Additionally, you have a couple of enjoyably devastating magic attacks at your disposal, and can toss mid-sized enemies at each other or ""execute"" prone ones just by jumping on them. And just to keep you on your toes, certain enemies even require you to use your ""bash"" move, which breaks shields and interrupts deadly special attacks, but is otherwise weak.', ""Taking around 10-12 hours to play through, Sacred 3 unfolds across 38 stages; 15 of these are lengthy and story-driven, while the rest are pleasantly short side missions that frequently grant support items, like extra health-potion slots or magical shields. Apart from the occasional hidden treasure chest, each stage is extremely linear  and while you can visit them in any order, jumping ahead usually means a quick death if your character hasn't hit the requisite experience level for a given stage. Conversely, a level-six stage (for example) is easy to storm through if you're at level seven or above  and here's where problems with difficulty start."", ""Early on, Sacred 3 can be pretty tough, with ungenerous checkpoints and a nasty habit of surrounding powerful enemies with constant streams of low-level irritants. Simply fighting through the side missions in order can make you just a little too powerful for the challenges ahead, however  and once you get the hang of your enemies' predictable, frequently telegraphed attacks, even the toughest boss fights suddenly become a breeze. (To be fair, each stage has multiple difficulty settings, although these just raise the level recommendations, so the same issues apply.)"", ""As important as leveling up is, Sacred 3's RPG elements are kept light, with new weapons, spells, and other abilities unlocked automatically as you gain power. Your choices are limited to picking which ones you'll carry into battle, and whether to upgrade them using collected gold. It works well enough for simple hack-and-slasher, but its rigidity is still annoying, particularly when it automatically improves weapons you hardly use and makes you wait to upgrade your favorites."", 'The closest things Sacred 3 has to collectible loot, meanwhile, are its ""weapon spirits,"" ghostly companions collected on the battlefield who impart both benefits and penalties. Some make you a better team player, giving allies a substantial boost from health orbs in exchange for a slight decrease in your own healing, while others let you deal more damage at the expense of taking a little more of it yourself  and if you find one that works for you, it can be a big factor in making you an indomitable powerhouse.', ""The most important thing to consider, however, is how grating or likeable you find the weapon spirits as characters, because they're going to talk to you a lot. In addition to cutscenes, Sacred 3's action is supported by a steady stream of in-game dialogue  some of it from the heroes, some of it from their weapon spirits, and the vast majority of it from Aria, the heroes' slightly awkward tactician. Communicating telepathically, she constantly prods you along with observations and suggestions about what to do next  although her telepathy hardly seems unique, since Zane and his generals (who have gag names like Karr Tel and Zeptik) regularly drop in on the conversation to taunt you about whatever challenge is waiting for you next (or sometimes just to talk about nachos). It's all very goofy and anachronistic, and while the jokes can get tiresome (Zep'tik's constant malapropisms run thin, for example, as does Marak beginning every other sentence with a G-rated oath), the absurdity of the chatter does a lot to buoy the overall experience."", ""Sacred 3 is fine as a single-player game, but more fun with friends along, although the constant chaos and minimal differences between characters make it feels more like splitting the work than actually working together in a complementary sense. Even without real support roles, though, help can make certain tedious segments go more quickly  like whenever you're ordered to spin a wheel six times (with each spin spawning a new horde of enemies) before you can move on to the next area. Sadly, it's hard to get a decent connection (at least with the PC version), and all of my attempts to play with a full set of four heroes were annoyingly choppy. It's a major disappointment for such a multiplayer-focused game.""]",IGN

Thats pretty great, but once the silly novelty wears off, youre left with a mostly harmless infinite runner that doesnt do much to distinguish itself within a crowded genre.', 'That being said, while infinite runners are a dime a dozen on the app store (actually, most are free), many dont feel as good to play as Sharknado. Swiping to dodge cars, jump on sharks, and duck below roadblocks is quick and responsive on a touch screen, and I never died because of what felt like a sluggish input. For a game that hinges on your ability to complete quick, minute tasks at a fast pace, this is a very good thing.', '\n', 'Sharknado has three lanes to weave between, and they arent there simply to look pretty. The goal of some levels is to kill different kinds of sharks with bats, golf clubs, and other weapon pick-ups. A more difficult lane lined with obstacles might also contain rarer sharks, which net you rewards based on how many youve killed. Having to make quick decisions based on risk and reward adds a small layer strategy to a type of game normally focused on reflexes.', 'Rewards for good play, unfortunately, arent so compelling. Every level has three parts: the aforementioned street segment, a surfing section, and the boss level, which is a showdown with a full-blown sharknado. After finishing one round, your character is booted back to the streets to do the same thing again, only with more obstacles and less room for error. There are no alternate paths or even an aesthetic change to shake up the bland, blocky look of the scenery, and the cycle quickly feels tiring.', 'The song that plays during the surfing segment deserves a special shout out. If you imagine really hard, it sounds sort of like The Ramones, if The Ramones had written a song about not wanting to die in a sharknado. Its silly and it made me laugh, but after dozens of tries, it wore out its welcome.', 'In-app purchases are common in mobile game territory, and Sharknado is no different  right down to the dual-currency system. Both gold and chum can be acquired in game without too much grinding, and the upgrades they unlock  like more durable weapons  are well worth the investment. Chum can be used to revive yourself after death, and each subsequent revival within a run will cost you more chum. Its a good, cheap way to offer a second chance and minimize frustrations.']",IGN

So, what now? Unfortunately, for all its artistry, style, and clever ideas, thats a question Abyss Odyssey isnt yet ready to answer. While exploring why though, let me apologize in advance for when I inevitably call it Abes Oddysee by accident. Its going to happen, even if the two have almost nothing in common. Certainly, this one has considerably fewer evil corporations, sneaking puzzles, and farting alien saviors.', 'The fencing style works superbly, putting its focus on timing and dodging.', 'I see no reason not to trust you implicitly.', 'Tougher enemies rarely force much change in tactics, just extra pressure.', 'Soldiers are useless compared to the main characters, but enough to get to a  respawn shrine.', 'Most enemies will politely hang back and wait turns rather than rudely gang-rushing.', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'As expected from ACE Team, creators of Zeno Clash and Rock of Ages, Abyss Odyssey is gloriously designed, wonderfully weird, and has a style all of its own. The premise is that a warlock is sleeping deep within the Earth, so powerful that his dreams are spawning a whole dungeon and creatures that are breaking through to an unprepared surface. Only another figment of his imagination, the swordswoman Katrien, has the power and magic, and more importantly, contractual immortality to lead the charge through the randomly shifting levels and take him out before his nightmares destroy the world.', 'Its a beautiful nightmare - one of violin-playing demons and ethereal combat and art nouveau touches instead of the usual dark and gothic blandness. The soundtrack is fantastic, and the art is even better, with exquisite attention to detail in character animation and portraits and cool visual flourishes throughout.', 'Each time through, the levels and paths through the Abyss are randomized, and the levels themselves procedurally generated, from ice caves to graveyards to toxic forests of spitting, writhing plant life. Its far more conventional than Zeno Clash, but everythings relative. Its still endearingly offbeat.', 'The meat of Abyss Odyssey, though, is in fighting, with a system that appears to be patterned on Super Smash Bros. Each direction key is a potential special attack, with a blocking shield move, and a heavy reliance on timing. Simply mashing the attack buttons isnt good enough; many special moves cant be cancelled once started, enemies are untouchable during certain actions and capable of shield-breaking that defense, and the tight camera angle and usually locked-down arenas means that theres usually nowhere to run. There are reports of players finding it laggy and sluggish, but that wasnt the case on the PC version with a wired Xbox 360 controller - only occasionally did I hit a few issues like Katrien walking backwards instead of turning around, or failing to clamber up a ledge, or getting bounced between enemies with little scope for a block or a counterattack. Its a combat system that rewards precision and control, with character level and skills persisting between games, and items and souls collectible in individual runs.', 'Items are dull, though; just weapon upgrades and potions. Souls stolen from enemies, though, allow you to shift into them at will, in a very cool mechanic that would be far more satisfying if you werent already so capable of destroying everything in a ballet of death.', 'And thats the big problem here: Its simply too easy to blitz through the Abyss without even much in the way of skill, at least on the normal difficulty mode - a Nightmare one was recently added too, which certainly makes it tougher, but not particularly more interesting to work through. If you fall, youre replaced by a weaker soldier who can bring you back if he reaches a shrine, and checkpoints can be activated using specific tokens for a couple of restarts before being kicked back to the top. Only the final enemy is much of a challenge, mostly because of one specific and very cheap attack (this being ACE Team, its a magic stream of fish...) and then youre done.', 'While this isnt a Roguelike as such, its enough of one that the basic premise applies - the charm of these games is in repeatedly pushing, hopefully getting a little further each time and slowly exploring the toybox. Abes Oddysee- crap! Abyss Odyssey embraces neither. Its built on the idea that the core combat is enough to carry it, and its simply not. The entire story of the Warlocks Journal is revealed in a single playthrough, and while there are two characters to unlock, neither offers enough refreshment for another run. Even most of the spot challenges presented, including taking on a demon and fighting the shopkeepers, Spelunky style, are less of a challenge than they pretend. Abyss Odysseys skeleton is all there, but theres nowhere near enough meat on the bones.', 'The plan is that in the longer term, this will change. In particular, the Warlock is simply in his first form; once enough players have beaten him, as illustrated by a fractured mask, ACE Team will be adding more content and a new phase.', 'Unfortunately for Abyss Odyssey, beating the game just a couple of times is more than enough for it to outstay its welcome. Certainly, there are more challenges, including a few tougher bosses to fight, other entrances to the abyss to unlock, and gathering fighters for the four-player local multiplayer Versus mode that really embraces the fighting systems Smash Bros roots in tightly enclosed arenas. When none of them are rewarding though, or even feel particularly helpful once completed, theyre less game-extending challenges than they are ACE Team pouring a bag of marbles onto the floor and saying Go pick those up.', 'The Binding of Isaac and Spelunky are great examples of Rogue games that kept expanding; dangling new challenges and adding enough new draws to make it worth pushing past their initial endings to the secrets and new toys and tougher challenges after cresting the capability curve. Abyss Odyssey is what happens when it doesnt work, when that extra playtime is expected but never actually earned.', 'The random nature of the levels helps little, but the very limited platforming required, tight zoom, mere handful of hazards and durability of the main character means it doesnt really matter what the seed produces. It always feels like running through the same basic levels with a random mix of enemies that rarely demand any change-up in tactics, leaving the exact details of the map close to irrelevant. Unlike Metroid-style games, there arent any keys or obstacles requiring specific skills to get past; all Abyss Odyssey demands is that you get to the exit, or maybe choose one to chart a path down via the occasional specific room or extended runs of maps with a particular difficulty rating.', 'The result of all this is a very well made, fantastically presented game with a solid central core, but one that reads the Rogue bible without seeming to understand why it has so many disciples. In particular, the first time you win a game like this should be a rush of endorphins and achievement, and just as theres only one chance to make a first impression, theres only one to stick the landing.

On one level I stared at the screen for about five minutes, contemplating every possible route to get the last child I needed to rescue to beat the area while avoiding a malicious black spirit that would drain about a fourth of my current health. But if I made too many useless moves here, I could end up without enough left to finish the next level. I eventually got to the child, but not without taking a spirit to the face - acceptable losses. That risk-reward balance is a clever hook at first, but it too quickly became less exciting as I played.', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'Learning to match the varied animals, monsters, spirits, and other objects scattered across Roads randomized levels in the fewest movements possible was, at first, unforgiving (leading to situations like my five-minute stumper). Every new object was a surprise, and some are as likely to end a good run on the spot as they are to help you out. But thats to be expected from a Roguelike, where the first few sessions are more about learning the ins and outs than anything else.', 'Most Roguelikes remove all your progress on death, making your knowledge of what to expect next time around the most palpable form of progress; here that knowledge is solidified in the form of a persistent and indispensable notebook that fills out as you uncover new objects and combinations. Being able to look up what each piece I encountered could turn into got me out of quite a few jams, so I appreciated that I didnt have remember how every piece fit together.', 'In filling out the notebook I gleefully poked and prodded everything around me, discovering unintuitive things like how two fire spirits and one ancient mortar create a nourishing apple. Even when the results ended up hurting me (word to the wise: dont mix rabbits and spirits!), I knew that Id benefit from knowing more about these interactions in the long run. This initial stage of discovery was the most exciting, since I was trying to learn more about how everything fit together and treated each level as a sandbox instead of a goal. Remember that dark spirit I had to tackle to get to the child? It became cause for celebration once Id figured out how to turn it into something useful.', 'The discovery stage doesnt last as long as Id have liked. The same way that a large house begins to feel smaller as you become familiar with it, I began to realize that there simply wasnt as much to discover or to do as it first appeared. Learning as many tricks as possible is all well and good, but once I had over half the of the secrets unlocked, I stopped tinkering and played more cautiously. The most common enemies are the ones worth learning; once you know your way around those, there isnt much reason to learn the more obscure combinations.', 'After shifting into a more goal-minded gear, Roads central conflict of interest began popping up. At one point I stumbled upon an interesting puzzle that looked like it couldve provided insight into the intriguing backstory. But even though I had health to spare, I decided not to solve it in favor of moving on - I was having a good run and it just didnt seem worth the risk. Its this kind of dynamic that undercuts the exploration thats so heavily encouraged; why try something new when you know the safer option will get the same result, risk-free? All roguelikes have these kinds of risk-reward systems, but here the reward lost its appeal. I accomplished the bare minimum before moving on in order to have the highest chance of surviving.', 'That seems in line with Roads between-level segments, which emphasize how bleak life is for the residents living outside of the forest. You can talk to all of the downtrodden villagers, exchange gifts for rewards (like banning particularly annoying monsters or pieces from appearing in future levels), and eventually marry someone youve made friends with. They often repeat lines like It doesnt get any better, does it? and when you dont rescue all of the children in a level youre reminded that youve just doomed someones child. The bleak story contrasts with the cutesy look in pleasantly unsettling ways, as the caricatures around you get sick, feel emotionally distant, and become jealous of you and each other as you enter into relationships based purely around gift-giving. It was like watching a childrens cartoon go south, which I found fun to watch.', 'This tale doesnt have much of a payoff, though, and once I made it to the end, all of it -- the notebook, the villagers, the remaining secrets -- seemed insubstantial. I didnt really want to go back to unearth the rest of the secrets of the forest; in a goal-oriented environment, there isnt much of a point to seeing what else you can do after the goals been met. Beating Road Not Taken dropped me right back at the start, but playing the earlier levels again wasnt rewarding since they were now a breeze, and having a starting health cap for every level meant that there wasnt much point in doing that much better than I had been. The levels being randomized helped alleviate some of that, but theyre actually not as varied as you might think -- only different enough to ensure that the same exact solutions dont work twice.']",IGN

It helps break bad habits of cheesing repetitive moves or relying on one stat-maxed hero with quest goals that require you to use all nine characters. Bonuses are also given for mixing up your moves. A parry system (ala the Batman Arkham games) makes defense a factor in the fight, although the one-button blocking technique is too loose to feel rewarding after Id sharpened my skills for a few hours."", 'Instead of a versus mode (which is missed as a multiplayer option, as the local-only co-op feature is negligible,) there is an extensive Battle Coliseum side-game which tosses you a good variety of recycled boss battles and survival challenges. And although the Fishing and Catching minigames are clumsy, about halfway through the Story mode you will unlock a bridge to what I like to call Minigame Island -- a place that offers a few better (if still minor) distractions. Unlimited World Red is never extraordinarily difficult, but some quests do set up tough goals to meet, and there is a more difficult second quest to play through as well.', 'Brawling gameplay is plenty accessible, but Unlimited World Red hits rough waters when the overdone RPG element comes into play. It is designed to add depth, but instead piles on padding and confusion. Despite pop-up tutorial features that try to explain all of the many mechanisms, there were whole chunks of features that I never thought to touch until I was nearly finished with the 10 hour main quest. Good luck trying to keep straight the difference between Skill Words, Item Words, or Custom Words (all of which are different from Strong Voice commands, by the by.) I spent hours smacking desert plants looking to find the crafting ingredient Juicy Cactus Pulp before realizing that this item was an unlabeled reward in a side-quest. There are hundreds of collectibles and craftables and junk to go fetch, but oddly, youre never actually unlocking any new combat moves, just supplementing the stats. Strange design decisions and unclear stat labels make Unlimited World Red a much stranger and longer game than it needs to be.', ""If you start to get tired of the fetching and the fighting, however, take some time to look around. Developer Ganbarion has captured the anime look of One Piece with a game engine saturated in color in every version of Unlimited World Red we tested (a Vita copy was not available for review.) The design style uses the glossier modern One Piece look, and every version, down to the diminutive 3DS platform (which neglects to use the stereoscopic 3D display, but does offer the same world layout and gameplay as the HD versions,) offers huge levels that can pack several enemies and massive bosses on screen without framerate hiccups. and I didn't see any of the draw-in issues that have been a problem in previous One Piece Unlimited games (through waves of enemies do pop-in, by design.)"", 'Unlimited World Red uses the Japanese voices and subtitles in the place of a dub, which is a benefit to hardcore fans, although it may take some getting used to (and some reading) for those expecting the Funimation voice cast.

Of course someone would try to emulate its success on iPad. Fates Forever is one such attempt at a mobile MOBA, and indeed, it looks enough like League that passers-by often asked me if its a cheap clone job. I was glad to be able to answer that Fates Forever does feel like a distinct and good-quality game, thanks to its personality and well-thought-out interface design.', 'While its touch controls arent as precise as a mouse, Fates Forever managed to make me feel like I was in control of the fast-paced action. I had full control over the interface, my hero, and their skills with just one hand. As the ranged archer hero, I felt great dragging my finger toward a target to land a timing-based skill shot. The same gesture works for throwing stun items or charging toward groups, depending on the character. Its never going to be as quick as a mouse would be, but because everyone is on a level playing field, it never feels wrong, and the action never suffers for it. Bonus: The impressive interface has minimal clutter, so the skill icons and inventory rarely feel invasive.', 'The unique feel of Fates Forever comes from its smaller-than-usual scale. Two teams of three players walk down the top or bottom lanes of a rectangular battlefield, accompanied by minions who protect heroes from the defensive towers they must destroy to win the match. The two-lane map (as opposed to the usual three) makes me think differently about how I push enemies out of lanes than I do in other MOBAs  Its similar in that there are never enough heroes to protect all lanes equally, but youre likely to have one person alone at all times, so the pressure is almost always on.', 'So much so, in fact, that the middle area of the map -- a jungle filled with neutral enemies who give gold and experience when killed -- went entirely unused in every match I played. It feels like a waste to have it, honestly - its a place to ambush enemies transferring between lanes, but on its own the jungle isnt worthwhile to many heroes who seem better suited to fight in lanes.', 'Fates Forever matches are on the shorter side too, so theres just not as much incentive to leave my lane -- I have a role to fill in a short time, and the jungle feels like a fruitless distraction. I wont complain about the game length here, though, because the grueling 45-minute battles I play in Dota 2 or League of Legends dont suit this platform -- 20 minutes is plenty enough for an iPad game, thanks.', 'Im not saying its in any way novel, but I adore the fairy-tale/fable aesthetic. Fates Forever, like League of Legends, doesnt take itself seriously, giving its strategic, team-based combat a welcoming bit of levity. I laugh every time I see the angry, bomb-throwing bird hero who wears a guitar on his back. The 10 characters are all sort of silly like this. Muay Thai Dog. Ninja Rabbit. Knight Frog. Blacksmith Rhino Guy. Hammer Pig. I dont remember any of their names, but I enjoy using their distinct skills equally.', 'Most of them are archetypes many MOBA fans will find familiar. Area-of-effect slows, damage-over-time attacks, precision-based stuns, heals -- Fates Forever doesnt try to break new ground, opting instead to appropriate whats known for a tablet version as best as it can. Thats a strong start.', 'Again, as in League of Legends, Hero characters rotate between free/paid depending on the week, giving you the chance to play as different characters without having to pay for them. Yet when you do pay, the pricing seems strangely arbitrary, with certain heroes costing more in-game or real currency without much explanation. Some can be unlocked within an hour of play, but others require up to 10 times that, even though they dont feature obvious more expensive qualities.', 'Fates Forever it approximates the same core idea, scales it down, and does it effectively is an achievement on its own.

The series has had five years now to perfect its gameplay and options, and the success of Blizzard's Hearthstone has introduced an enthusiastic new generation to the addictiveness of collectible card games. And yet... this is what we get. Developer Stainless Games may have finally introduced some form of the open deck-building players have clamored for since 2009, but it's smothered under a bland presentation, a shocking lack of expected features, and one of the saddest cases of tripping over its own  microtransactions this side of last year's Dungeon Keeper."", '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'A silver lining of Magic 2015s depressing cloud is that its disappointments never entirely shatter the basic appeal.

It explains the strengths of the five colored decks well enough, so a newcomer could at least jump into the main campaign knowing that white decks are all about healing and angels and green decks place a heavy emphasis on conjuring beasties to aid you in battle.', ""Yet problems pop up immediately, such as the fiddly interface that's clearly designed specifically for the tablet version that came out a week before. It relies heavily on swiping back and forth through menus and options. While that's at least understandable (if not exactly efficient) on an iPad, on the PC it keeps essential options, such as manual land selection and simple graphics tweaks, stuffed behind overlong transitions. All of that drags actions that should take 10 seconds into half a minute of drudgery. Duels games have always suffered from minor interface inconveniences, but just getting around in Magic 2015 sometimes seems to take as much mental effort as the puzzle matches of Duels past, with none of the payoff.

Because of the poor rewards, I felt compelled to pay beyond the initial $10 buy-in to get the most out of Magic 2015, by which I mean to have a chance in multiplayer. The option to purchase themed decks was available in the past, but here the sale of cards from each arc of the campaign feels more like a necessity in light of the grind that awaitsa decision which makes some sick sense in light of the iOS version's blank price tag. (Why even bother, then, with a cover price on Steam?) Hours of grinding still won't net you the 10 best cards, however, which are only available through premium booster packs that run for $1.99 a pop."", ""Microtransactions aside, it's a shame that the 2015 version of this once-proud game feels best defined by what it lacks. The questions fly by like bullets to anyone who's played the series before. Where are the revenge matches, the Two-Headed Giant cooperative mode, the Archenemy multiplayer mode? They have passed like rain on the mountain, apparently."", ""Its also a dreary-looking game. Magic: The Gathering has the kind of artwork that could keep me entranced for hours, but the playing field here is a bland affair that looks like a white sliding door from the U.S.S. Enterprise turned on its side. The colored and detailed boards of the past suited the artwork better; consider, for instance, the crimson layering of Magic 2012 or the deep blue field of play from last year's incarnation. Here the cards, seemingly tinier than in years past, get lost in the achromatic sea."", ""The best thing I can say about the situation is that somehow the old satisfaction of making a comeback when you only have two health points left still manages to shine through in all this mess, particularly in the multiplayer matches for three or four players. It's the kind of game that might hold some attraction if received as a gift, but if you're looking to jump into the video game versions of Magic yourself, you're better off looking at a more consistently enjoyable Duels game like Magic 2013.

246,Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty,21-Jul-14,Mikel Reparaz,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/21/oddworld-new-n-tasty-review,"[""As beloved as it is, certain aspects of Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee have aged about as well as a wet mummy. Clunky controls, unadjustable harsh difficulty, and graphics that are hideous when scaled up to HD resolutions mean high barriers to entry for newcomers, which make it harder to discover one of the most memorably imaginative games of the late '90s. Thankfully, it's a lot easier in Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty. Rebuilding Oddysee from scratch, New 'n' Tasty modernizes the original's gameplay and art while leaving its level layout and design largely untouched. The end result is a smoother, more vivid, and much more immediately fun retelling of the excellent first Oddworld story."", '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', ""A brilliantly weird side-scrolling adventure, New 'n' Tasty focuses on Abe, a puny, bumbling alien out to escape the sinister factory farm where he and his fellow Mudokons are enslaved. Because Abe is relatively defenseless and weak, this involves dodging a lot of spinning blades and explosive traps (something that requires careful timing and observation), sneaking past threats, and  if there's no security hardware nearby to prevent it  mind-controlling guards. That last one is cathartically violent, letting you remotely walk your enemies into mines, or wipe out their friends (or your friends, if you're feeling mean) with gunfire before making your host explode in gruesome chunks."", ""Getting through the assorted hazards is tough enough on its own, but you also have a secondary task to consider: rescuing other Mudokons by leading them safely past danger and into magical portals. You're free to ignore them and simply blast through the central challenges, in which case you'll get a shorter experience and a downer ending. Alternatively you can work to save them all, which involves discovering and exploring a lot of trap-filled secret rooms, which is a lot more rewarding. (Pure speed runs are also encouraged)."", ""In either case, leading them to freedom is a lot less frustrating than it used to be, now that you can command groups of them to follow you  and sneak, run, or hide  at once. That's just one of the changes New 'n' Tasty makes; levels are now seamlessly scrolling environments, giving them a more open, cohesive feel than Oddysee's single-screen puzzle rooms. You can now aim thrown objects with the right analog stick instead of simply tapping a button and hoping they find their targets, and Abe has a new, endless supply of bottlecaps you can toss around to briefly distract enemies and kill annoying bats. And while Abe still has a noticeable weight and momentum that make jumping or rolling between tightly spaced traps an imprecise bastard, the controls for doing so are a lot more responsive."", 'The biggest change  and possibly the most controversial  is ""Quiksave,"" which lets you instantly save your location and progress just by tapping the Dual Shock 4\'s touchpad, and reload by holding it down. This doesn\'t quite eliminate frustration  you\'ll probably still die pretty frequently  but it cuts down on it immensely, as you can now save just before trying something risky, or after each stage of a particularly tough challenge. I found it indispensable  hey, not everyone likes retracing all their steps from the last checkpoint when every mistake brings instant death  but it\'s easy to see hardcore fans crying foul, especially since there isn\'t a way to turn Quiksave off.', ""Couple that with rebalanced checkpoints, a gentler difficulty curve, and new camera angles (which reveal threats in advance and offer more visual clues about secret areas), and New 'n Tasty simply isn't as tough as the original, even on hard difficulty. However, the point here isn't so much to provide a brutal challenge as an enjoyable one  and New 'n' Tasty is definitely enjoyable. Its re-imaginings of RuptureFarms and the surrounding wilderness are hugely fun to puzzle through, delivering a continual stream of diverse new challenges, and certain sequences  like charging across cliffs on the back of Abe's hooting Elum, or rolling a giant spiked ball into a swarm of spidery Paramites  are much more exhilarating now that the scenery actually scrolls."", ""It all looks amazing, too. Everything, from Abe's giant talking head on the title screen, to the suspiciously helpful signs posted throughout the backgrounds, has been lavishly redrawn and re-animated, giving Oddworld a new, more vibrant appearance. And it's accompanied by a wealth of newly recorded dialogue for Abe, his fellow Mudokons, and the creepy Slig guards, giving them even more personality than they had before. This is a top-flight production, and while it would have been nice to see a few more additions  like, say, an actual co-op mode instead of an alternating two-player option thats misleadingly labeled as co-op  New 'n' Tasty is a fine return to form for a wonderfully strange classic.""]",IGN
247,Crimsonland,17-Jul-14,Colin Moriarty,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/17/crimsonland-review,"[""Crimsonland may be one of the most literal names ever given to a game. In 10tons' top-down shooter -- which originally came to PC way back in 2003 -- you're charged with eliminating seemingly endless waves of aggressive enemies, painting the landscape red with blood in the process. The result is an arcadey experience that's admittedly repetitive, but strangely (and deeply) addictive. It hits the same note over and over again, but it's not a note you'll necessarily tire of hearing."", ""For PlayStation fans, the most obvious analog for Crimsonland is Dead Nation, and while Crimsonland isn't as good -- it lacks the story, atmosphere, and grit of Housemarque's shooter -- it's arguably more grueling. Its graphically modest, to put it kindly. You won't have much to learn or memorize by way of controls, but that's the idea; the entirety of the action is controlled using the analog sticks to move and the R2 button to shoot. You can't run (without a short-lasting power-up) and you can't toggle between firearms. Crimsonland is all about challenging you to raise your skill level with the tools at hand, whatever they may be. It's not pretty to look at or listen to; it's just fun to play."", ""The bulk of Crimsonland can be found in its 60-stage campaign, a litany of stages that are repetitive, but not mindlessly so. Cruising through each almost identical-looking level -- which could take anywhere from 30 seconds to a few minutes each -- teaches you the finer points of Crimsonland's brutal risk and reward-centric combat, which can in turn be parlayed into its many score-based challenges. Better yet, at the end of each level, you'll unlock a new perk or weapon that can be used while chasing high scores on the leaderboards. You might want to jump right to the leaderboards from the word go, but that'd be a mistake; everything you need to learn and earn rests in a campaign that you'd be foolish to ignore. This is awesome, since there's a reason to play everything."", ""The weapons and perks are greatly varied, and you'll definitely find a few of each that you prefer as you play. There's not a lot of balance between items in your arsenal -- some firearms are straight-up better than others, especially those with spreadshot -- but the perks definitely cater to specific styles of play. Some perks can make you quicker, or regenerate your health, or make your weapons stronger. Others can sacrifice your energy (or even your life outright) in order to gain a one-time bonus, like an instant add-on to your final score. I love how versatile the weapons and perks are, even if the latter can only be used outside of the campaign."", ""What's so intriguing about the campaign -- and, in turn, the other modes that surround it -- is how dynamic such a simple premise with equally simple controls can be. At first glance, its emphasis on random item drops -- and the fact that you start out each level with the weakest weapon and get only what enemies leave behind -- Crimsonland may seem entirely luck-based. There's definitely an element of luck to be had here; if you don't get the right weapon for a specific stage, or some well-timed drops to help you out in a pinch, you'll likely fail. But Crimsonland requires skill, too. Lots of it. Learning when to risk yourself to detonate a nuke or grab a shield, or to swap your weapon for a new drop are essential decisions for success, and taking those risks keeps me on the edge of my seat. Living to tell the tale after taking a risk or barely surviving an onslaught makes Crimsonland exciting, and makes me want to keep playing, even if Im doing the same thing over and over again."", '', 'Blood, blood everywhere.', ""Crimsonland's real hook is its Survival Mode, however. Its really five modes put into one, using the same limited array of enemies from the campaign. Survival itself is joined by Rush, Weapon Picker, Nukefism, and Blitz, but all of them are throw-away except for Survival itself. Using perks and knowledge you earned in the campaign, you're unleashed upon a static map where endless waves of enemies will assault you. Survival -- like similar modes in the aforementioned Dead Nation and Resogun -- is a huge hook. Trying to up your high score to compete with friends and the anonymous masses on the leaderboards is truly addictive, though it doesn't have the longevity or the level of polish of Housemarque's games."", ""Interestingly, you can play the campaign and Survival with up to four players, though only local play is supported. Sitting down with a friend (or two, or three) certainly makes things far more manageable, but it's disappointing that you can't jump on the PlayStation Network and play with someone there, too. There's simply no excuse for local-only multiplayer in 2014. Period.""]",IGN

If a hostage panics too much, he runs. If he gets too comfortable, he attacks you. The police creep ever closer. The hack has a chance to shut down if you dont pay attention. Shoot at the guards to drive them back and all the hostages freak out.', '', '', '', '', 'There are six different things going on at once, and any one of them can fall apart and make all the others worse. Now your guard is having a nervous breakdown, and if he doesnt snap out of it the hostages are gonna run and dammit its all gone to hell again. Heres the fascinating bit: Gods Will Be Watching isnt a blockbuster shooter. It packs all that action into a point-and-click adventure game.', 'All of its chapters are life-or-death crisis points, where blood has or will be spilled and any slightly wrong choice could lead to total disaster. You click on the ground to move, on other characters to tell them what to do, and click on yourself to talk. Only tradition says that adventure games should be puzzle-heavy stories set in charming worlds, Gods Will Be Watching is a refreshing and challenging new direction for this type of game.', 'Gods joins Telltales recent much-acclaimed games, The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us, in reframing adventures. But it works in an opposite fashionTelltales games moved away from puzzles by focusing on dialogue and unique ethical choices, while Gods Will Be Watching focuses on resource and time management, judging random numbers, repeating tasks, and gathering information. And instead of the moral choices of a BioWare-style RPG, Gods uses a strategy game concept. Pay attention to everything and make the best (or the least terrible) choice available. Succeed or fail, learn and repeat. Its a novel feeling, while never veering from the form of an adventure game.', 'Each scenario generally gives you the overall plot goals quickly, then details about the specific manner of escaping the room. And it is usually a roomGods isnt a game with much explorationwhich can give it a claustrophobic feeling that works well with the extreme tension of its scenarios. Then youre told exactly what your characters can do in that situation. In one, for example, youre trapped in a cave where only a robot companion can recharge the power to keep the lights on, while only one of the other humans can repair the robot, and only those two can charge a machine that prevents your characters from freezing, and so on. While these scenarios often sound complicated in initial description, theyre pretty straightforward in practice.', 'The chief problem with this form of adventure game is that the difficult can veer wildly. In that first hostage situation, I had to restart a dozen times or more, trying to find the balance between hostage management and hack acceleration to put me through. Thats fineGods makes it clear that it can be a very difficult gamebut then the next two sections are relatively easy, with restarts that are totally optional. (Although it does troll you a bit by moving the goalposts on puzzlessometimes to make them easier, but also annoyingly to make them harder.) There are six chapters in Gods, and each takes between 10 and 40 minutes or so, so its theoretically a short game... unless that difficulty causes level restarts, which is pretty common.', 'Gods Will Be Watchings story works in harmony with its tense scenarios. The main character is an elite special forces soldier/spy, whose infiltration of a terrorist/freedom fighter group and status as a double agent puts him in the heart of the kinds of tense conflicts that Gods is built around. The jagged pixel art both suggests early 1990s adventure games and creates an appropriately disorienting mood around the brutality of the universe. That brutality can be somewhat overwhelming, however. The division of Gods Will Be Watching into small chapters of singularly intense events means that it relies on science fiction cliches of grand evil empires and hyper-competent soldiers to make sense, while the personal story is overwhelmingly bleak and occasionally nasty, filled with things like torture, murder, and human experimentation.']",IGN
249,Super Comboman,21-Jul-14,Scott Butterworth,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/21/super-comboman-review,"['Super Combomans style is easy to love. Its colorful art captures all the addictive fun of a sugary pop song. Its chubby hero bursts with the same clueless, wide-eyed enthusiasm that makes Scott Pilgrim so endearing. Its combo-driven approach to 2D sidescrolling beat-em-up action provides greater nuance than the genre typically enjoys. And yet, despite all that personality and potential, Super Comboman is also plagued by myriad problems, from frustrating technical glitches to poorly thought-out design decisions. While the superficial appeal never erodes completely, countless tiny aggravations certainly chip away at the bright, happy exterior.', '\n', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'Theres not much story to speak of, but the basic premise and overall tone definitely crank the wackiness up to 11. Struggles -- a mullet-sporting, comic-reading islander with a talking fanny pack companion -- takes a construction job to help pay down his mortgage and ends up fighting his way through ramen shops, toxic sewers... you know, the usual. Inexplicably, the company that employs Struggles also supplies all the enemies along the way, but hey, some questions dont require answers. Similarly, Comboman also never goes anywhere with its Paper Mario-esque sticker art style. I mean, why is everyone a sticker? Regardless, the hard white outlines create a unique aesthetic signature that, in concert with the goofy dialogue and cartoony sound effects, forms the lovable exterior I mentioned earlier.', 'Crack that candy shell, however, and youll begin to discover trouble in Struggles paradise. Lets start with the combat: Super Comboman ostensibly marries traditional two-button beat-em-up action with deeper fighting game mechanics like parries, super moves, and of course, combos. At its best, the combat recalls classics like Viewtiful Joe, and being able to trap enemies in aerial combos before sending them crashing through concrete walls definitely surpasses the usual button mashing thats part and parcel for sidescrollers. Unfortunately, though its ideas add a great deal of depth, Combomans combat actually ends up feeling awkward and inconsistent thanks to some annoying idiosyncrasies.', 'Heavy attacks, for example, require a cooldown, which makes for tricky timing and extremely hit-and-miss combos -- what seemed to work before may or may not work again. Enemy attacks, on the other hand, cannot be interrupted, and while most can be parried, apparently some cannot. Even after spending a solid 10 hours grinding all the way to the end, Im still not sure how to reliably distinguish between the two. Super moves like dragon punches and double lariats (yes, theres a lot of Street Fighter love here) dont trigger consistently despite simple inputs, though even once I developed a better feel for them, I never actually found a way to incorporate special moves into longer combos. Upon standing after being knocked prone, Struggles cant defend himself for a split second, which often means enemies get a free shot. God help you if youre downed with a bad guy on both sides -- theyll probably lock you in place until they gradually finish murdering you.', 'For all these reasons and more, Combomans combat just ends up feeling slightly off. That said, I was eventually able to (mostly) adapt and squeeze some genuine satisfaction out of pummeling room after room of construction-themed goons. They key word there, however, is eventually. Getting a feel for the combo system takes time, and during that period, Comboman wont cut you any slack. Theres no training mode, no difficulty adjustment, and only one way to earn extra lives. Checkpoints seem to be everywhere until you actually need them, potentially forcing you to replay long, difficult sections to get back to the one you havent beaten. The amount of damage you take often feels unpredictable, with some enemies inexplicably dealing damage that doesnt seem in any way proportionate to other attacks. I frequently didnt realize how close I was to dying as a result. Oh, and those damn pickaxe guys! Sure hope you like unavoidable projectile damage.', 'The tough learning curves not the only design flaw. Comboman relies a whole lot on, well, combos. But levels often dont provide enough fodder to keep your combo counter from expiring before you reach the next section, which means you usually cant activate the passive perks that require you to reach a certain combo level, which means you dont really need to worry about collecting coins to unlock those perks, which means you often have very little incentive to not simply avoid enemies and save your health for, say, a trial-and-error boss battle that will force you to replay an entire stage if you die three times. Ultimately, this wont prevent you from jumping in and kicking ass if you feel like it (fighting is the point here, after all), but it does mean one of the core mechanics simply isnt as well designed as it could have been if the combo counter dissipated more slowly.', 'Which brings us to Combomans most noticeable shortcoming: an obvious lack of technical polish. Though the development team has already started addressing some of these issues, I encountered enemies whod get stuck in fall animations or mindlessly kill each other, user interface glitches, poor soundtrack looping, improperly loaded graphics (e.g. a black square where an opponent should be), the occasional framerate chug, and -- worst of all in a fighting game -- input lag. None of these glitches broke Super Comboman entirely or were even present all the time, but honestly, developers need to get this stuff right before release, not after.']",IGN

Ending something isnt easy, but this is a storytelling team thats proved it knows how to stick the landing. Yet -- like The Wolf Among Us and The Walking Deads first season -- Episode 4 is an odd lull in a story thats built phenomenal momentum until now.', 'Amid the Ruins, like many of The Walking Deads point-and-click adventure game episodes, focuses on the calmer, quieter side of surviving the zombie apocalypse. Its bursts of unexpected violence force main character Clementine to make difficult decisions that leave her, a young orphan, responsible for the safety of the people she cares about. In Amid the Ruins, that ever-growing number of characters starts to dwindle.', 'It does not happen gracefully.', 'People in Clementines life seem to exist solely so their departure can hurt her. Often, this makes for meaningful moments that define her as a character -- specifically the version of her that you create by responding to terrible situations and potentially worse people.', 'Loss, specifically how Clementine processes and proceeds with it, remains the focus of The Walking Dead: Season 2. Amid the Ruins features plenty of loss, and some of the heavy decisions connected to them wield the same gut-punching power Telltale Games has become known for. Much of Amid the Ruins, however, felt like loss with little meaning, as though characters are being cut because the cast is too big, or they dont fit where the finale is going.', 'Characters vanish so rapidly and unexpectedly that it robs The Walking Dead of certain emotional value. Some exits are cheap, while others are unjustified, feel forced, or are forgotten as quickly as they happened. Worse, some of those unsatisfyingly departed characters are replaced by new villains -- introduced out of nowhere, with no clear motivation -- who feel out of place, inappropriate, and somewhat cartoonish.', 'In playing Amid the Ruins, I enjoyed discovering more about people weve spent little time getting to know. This episode spends a lot of time with Jane, the woman who helped Clem and her friends in Episode 3, as our young heroine learns about her past and takes lessons in killing zombies. Youll also see new conflicts arise between old friends and new. Resolving these problems is tense and satisfying as it always is, but most of it appears to be inconsequential by the end. Characters disregard unforgivable and unforgettable past events to focus on new problems, which lessened the impact of previous decisions Id made.', 'One fantastic scene in particular shows a grieving, despondent character clearly contemplating suicide. The performance is genuine, and it creates a heavy air that made me as uncomfortable as the concerned friends around him. In the scenes that follow a new tension snaps them out of it, but this person never revisits their own trauma, and never resolves the serious personal problem with Clementine that I created previously. For the first time in this season, I dont believe in what certain people are doing fits with their character and their history.', 'Meanwhile, although The Walking Dead: Season 2 has been building to something bigger for Clementine, it fizzles here by the end of Episode 4, the complex political drama thats been brewing between feuding sides all but evaporates. Bickering elders dont seem to weigh on Clementine as much as the grim things she has to do on her own. Shes starting to feel small, despite the big things shes doing. I dont know if thats a good or bad thing yet.', '\n', 'Maybe thats the point. Perhaps the desperation and hopelessness of The Walking Deads bleak world is starting to overwhelm Clementines story -- one where a little girl begins to break, to give in, and give up on what little she has left. This could be where The Walking Dead is headed. Where its at, like the first episode of Season 2, is in an interesting place for one person, and spinning its wheels for most everyone else.']",IGN

Your gorgeous adventure takes you to forgotten cities, labyrinthine tombs, and ancient lakes, all of which are predictably littered with a slew of things wanting you dead.', '\n', 'Check out our full review of Dark Souls 2 here.', 'As the first chapter in the Lost Crowns Trilogy, Sunken King makes Dark Souls 2 tougher than ever, and thats saying something. The ledges are narrow, a huge number of enemies carry poison weapons, and the entire thing is infested with giant insects that spew corrosive mist. More so than ever, youll have to juggle each encounter with managing your inventory and curing status and equipment ailments.', 'The combats just as tough, but fair as ever, but make no mistake  this DLC is going to squash anybody who isnt comfortable with being outnumbered five to one. Crowd control and the ability to draw in enemies one at a time is key to your survival.', 'The Sunken King took me about four hours to complete, though one of those hours was devoted entirely to a particularly nasty boss. Speaking of, the big baddies do not disappoint  theyre crazy tough, and range from groups of human warriors to something far more ancient and dangerous. I wont go into too much detail, but lets just say this guys up there with some of the toughest bosses in the whole Souls series.', 'The biggest addition in this DLC is the introduction of puzzles in the form of dozens of pillars that you can raise and lower using their corresponding levers. These pillars can be used to access new areas, provide cover from enemy arrows, but haphazardly throwing every switch can also  remove the only obstacle between you and a group of ghouls. Its a level of environmental interactivity that hasnt really been seen in the Souls series, but certainly a welcome addition.', '\n', 'But while the interactivity is great, the environment itself doesnt enough visual cues to make puzzle solving fun. I felt like I was stumbling across the solutions, as opposed to discovering them by figuring something out. This is particularly problematic in the second area. Even once Id cleared all of the enemies from the aforementioned tomb, I was consistently lost thanks to the ocean of gray and unremarkable rooms. Nothing takes me down from the high of killing a few dozen ghouls quite like having to draw a scratch-paper map to find the nearest bonfire.']",IGN

In Divinity: Original Sin, it's about discovering how you affect the world. I realized the power at my disposal when I used my mage's rain spell to douse the flames afflicting a boat in the starting town of Cyseal. Piff, down went the flames and up went the cheering arms of the rescued sailors. No yellow question marks or blathering NPCs bid me do it; it simply seemed like a good idea at the time. And praise the sun, it was. That's the kind of rewarding experimentation that lies at the heart of Divinity: Original Sin. Discovering how its many complex pieces interact with each other and how its complex and amazing spell system can be used to your advantage is what keeps it going for the majority of its outstanding 60-ish hours of questing."", ""Despite the name, originality in the fundamental style of roleplaying gameplay doesnt appear to have been a priority here; developer Larian Studios seems to have concerned itself more with skillfully stoking the flames of nostalgia. Divinity: Original Sin is the kind of game I briefly expected to play when I heard Overhaul Games was making an enhanced version of Baldur's Gate a couple of years back, as it coats the same type of experience that got me hooked on the digital incarnations of Gary Gygax's Dungeons & Dragons legacy with rich, modern graphics and contemporary relevance. It's all here, from the top-down perspective as you follow four adventurers from above like Warhammer pieces on a tabletop, to turn-based combat and the clunky menus that seemingly require more skill that it takes to wield a sword. As someone with fond memories of those RPGs, that alone would make Original Sin an eyecatching game."", 'Fortunately, it\'s more than that. Take the overarching story of two ""Source hunters"" tracking down the dastardly fiends who dabble in ""Sourcery."" (I know Terry Pratchett was using the term way back during the heydey of Super Mario Bros. 3, but it still sounds like one of the more forced attempts to wring some freshness of out the terminology of conventional high fantasy.) Much as in big-budget roleplaying peers such as Skyrim or Mass Effect, the overarching plot revolving around (of course) saving the world never entirely smothers the experience of side activities, and you\'ll even find the occasional joke worming its way into the heady stuff. It\'s a safe route that perhaps escapes the demands of living up to the storytelling quality of a game like Planescape: Torment, but Original Sin\'s writers are competent enough to make the direction work well.', ""Much of the appeal of Original Sin's scattered quests stems from the way Larian peppers them with humor and subtle pop-culture references, along with little tidbits of conflict with NPCs sprinkled into the responses for the text-based pop-up responses to quests. These conflicts are almost always resolved with a virtual game of Rock, Paper, Scissors, and they provide a welcome diversion when the two main characters are allowed to bicker over the merits of their actions in a key quest (particularly when you're in charge of controlling both of them). Sometimes these little spats give stat boosts or disposition gains, but they're most effective in the online cooperative mode as a means of injecting some roleplay into the experience aside from the combat  and swapping items between the two heroes."", 'Quests themselves are well-written adventures dealing with conflicts like ancient blood feuds and racial tensions. Do you, for example, help an elf whose family was murdered by orcs kill an innocent descendent of the vicious orc tribe, try to talk him out of it, or fool him into leaving by either faking the orcs death or stealing an amulet as proof you killed her? Divinity: Original Sins quests are full of these kinds of great moral choices, and most of them have two or more possible outcomes that really made me feel like I had control over the fate of the characters.', ""Combat is where Divinity: Original Sin shakes off its mantle of tradition and comes into its own. There's a faint echo of Magicka in its heavily use of various spell and elemental combinations for devastating effects, but Larian distinguishes itself by working that system into almost every moment of combat to create opportunities for crowd control and environmental advantages that demand some brainwork even on the easiest of the three difficulty modes. My trick with the rain merely showed that system at its simplest; future encounters rarely let you get off so easily. You might have to dispel a poison cloud with a flame spell, then drench the flames with another blast of the rain spell to clear the way. Sometimes plans can backfire, such as when I discovered that I'd accidentally thrown a shock spell at an enemy who was standing in a puddle that extended under my own feet. Oops. And get this: all the enemies can use these same spell combinations against you. It's a clever tactical dynamic that manages to keep every encounter fresh and memorable, even after many hours."", ""I did have a rough time figuring the combat system out over the first 10 hours of play, to say nothing of other unexpected tricks such as using a spell to burn down locked doors instead of wearing down a weapon's durability by hacking at them. Theres a tutorial covering the basics, but the rest of Divinity: Original Sin is characterized by some of the most brazen lack of hand-holding this side of Dark Souls."", ""That creates some annoying questing issues that, while they certainly didnt ruin my enjoyment, do need to be mentioned. Sometimes the key to one quest lies in another, and the scant quest journal rarely alludes to such overlaps. At times the awkward inventory, which demands constant  juggling of items between four team members, adds to the confoundment. At least twice I didn't realize I already had the proper quest object because it was in the inventory of character who wasn't currently in conversation. When your party's carrying an object that's akin to the Holy Grail, you'd think the bearer would at least have the gumption to announce it. I spent embarrassing swaths of time in Original Sin just trying to figure out what to do next."", ""At the same time, I liked how not everything was spelled out for me. [Minor mechanical spoiler] When I discovered that you can pilfer a house of its valuables by using one of your party members to distract the owner in conversation while another steals, it was fantastic. [End minor spoiler.] In fact, setting aside the issues with the inventory and the occasional vague quest objective, the challenge of learning Original Sin's systems was a big part of why I enjoyed it. It compelled me to think about my actions and choices, which is more than I usually get to say about contemporary RPGs. Since the option for a skill reset doesn't appear until late in the campaign, I had to stop and start several times before I settled on two Source hunters that were well suited for confronting the occasional extreme challenges Id run into on the previous attempt. It was all grueling work that set me days behind schedule, but it was deliciously satisfying when the pieces finally started falling into place."", ""Though Original Sins now out of its extended Early Access beta, there are a few holes that Larian is still working to fill, such as the absence of named and voiced followers besides the warrior and mage you pick up in the first town. But this is one of those games that'll probably gain a degree of immortality itself from the community itself, as it comes equipped with extensive modding capabilities that will allow players to craft their own adventures for the Source hunters. But it's a credit to what Larian has accomplished here that those tools don't feel as essential for Original Sin's longevity as they do for some lesser RPGs.""]",IGN
253,MouseCraft,11-Jul-14,Leah B. Jackson,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/11/mousecraft-review,"['Vigorously working my brain to save a troupe of adorable, Lemming-like mice from MouseCrafts series of deadly traps made me feel a bit like a rodent in a maze myself. Placing Tetris-like bricks to guide them (well, at least one of them) over a growing list of hazards like acid, electricity, and explosives was about five hours worth of consistently tough and interesting puzzling challenges that only occasionally hit a frustrating wall.', 'The early puzzles of MouseCraft do a nice job of introducing you to using Tetriminoes to guide up to three slow-moving mice through 2D stages to a delicious block of cheese. You get a set amount of specific pieces to use per level, making it important to rotate and place them properly so your mice can get where you want them to go. The mice walk single-mindedly from left to right on their own (much like Lemmings) and can only jump up one brick at a time, so building a path for them to reach the cheese can take some doing.', '\n', ""Puzzles, or experiments, ramp up in difficulty quickly, and soon had me working hard. Unfortunately, there aren't any hints in MouseCraft to help get you unstuck, and after retrying one level over two dozen times, even a small tip would have been welcome. Even though it looks cartoony, this isnt a game young children should be expected to get through without help  which may be a good thing."", 'The bright style of MouseCraft is eyecatching, but there isnt much personality to be found in this vibrant science lab. While cute, the mice dont do much of anything other than walk towards cheese and smile when they get there. I did feel a bit guilty whenever they fell into a pool of electrocuted water and their little ghost-mouse bodies floated away though. Sorry, little guy! The biggest missed opportunity is that the mad scientist character, Schrodinger the cat, simply watches from the background as you guide the mice through each experiment. Hes fun in cutscenes, but doesnt add anything other than something to look at in the background of each stage. Even when the backgrounds of a level change, he always stays the same.', ""To keep the experiments interesting, every so often you'll uncover new hazards, like water or acid, along with new types of bricks to help you overcome them. There are seven brick types in all, and the rate at which you're introduced to new mechanics is satisfying enough. I never felt overwhelmed with what I was working with. I also like how the different bricks vary in how they interact with certain hazards, giving puzzles an extra layer of complexity and requiring more precise timing. A normal brick disintegrates in acid, for example, whereas an Indestructible Brick doesn't. The Crumbling Brick, meanwhile, vanishes after two mice walk over it."", '\n', ""This is where MouseCraft's time-freeze feature is fantastically helpful. Any time you need to meticulously place a brick and don't want any mice to get in your way, or if you want to stop them from moving up to or past a certain area, you can stop time and noodle your way to a solution. Conversely, the nifty speed-up-time option was useful for when I knew Id solved a puzzle correctly and wanted to the mice to quickly reach their prize. Unlimited undos are nice too, as I never felt too much pressure when experimenting with brick placement."", ""Along the way to the cheesy goodness, you also have to position bricks to guide your mice through glowing blue shards in every level, which unlock access to later levels. Gathering them all adds an additional challenge, as they're often completely out of the way of the cheese. But a problem arose when I decided to skip some shards and go straight for the goal in a few puzzles, because I hit a point where I needed 20 more to proceed. In theory thats fine, because you can freely go back and replay a level to pick up shards youve missed... but there's no way of telling how many remain in each of the 80 levels. I had to guess which levels to replay, which was a frustrating and time-consuming roadblock."", '\n', 'On the other hand, going back to collect missing shards does add some replayability to MouseCraft, as does its level editor. I had fun creating a few tough puzzles for my friends using all the different bricks and hazards. While its available on both PC and all the PlayStation systems, you currently cant share them online on the PlayStation versions - just with your friends on the couch.', 'On PC, I was a little annoyed I couldnt change the keybinds. The frequently used E button releases the mice and speeds up time, and its right next to the R button, which entirely resets a level and erases all your efforts. Having to redo everything because I pressed the wrong button stank as much as the cheese at the end of each level.']",IGN

I'm happy to report that Naughty Dog has successfully brought PlayStation 3's single best game -- The Last of Us -- to PlayStation 4 in the form of The Last of Us: Remastered. (You can read my full review of 2013s The Last of Us on PS3 here.) Its as much a masterpiece on PS4 as it is on PS3, and its worth your undivided attention whether youve played it already or are about to jump in for the first time."", 'Sure, we may not have really needed a port so quickly, but then again, The Last of Us isnt just any game. As one of the best games of all-time, the more places it is and the more people that can play it, the better.', 'The biggest change Remastered brings is its framerate. The original version of The Last of Us pushed the PlayStation 3 to its absolute limits to pull off 30 frames per second at 720p resolution, but the PlayStation 4 runs Remastered at 60 frames per second and 1080p resolution. Its a jarring change at first, but one that I began to appreciate the more I played.', 'If you dont agree, Naughty Dog has included the option to lock the framerate to the original 30, but it was flipping back and forth that made me really begin to see the contrast. Its hard to explain how much of a difference the 30-to-60 transition makes until you see it for yourself; the PS3 original frankly looks a bit choppy by comparison.', 'Doubling the framerate doesnt only provide an obvious aesthetic boost; it enhances gameplay, too. The most hardcore competitive shooters on consoles  like the Call of Duty series  run at or near 60 frames because it makes the shooting that much more fluid, responsive, and accurate. Youll see similar effects in The Last of Us: Remastered during gun battles, even if they are (or should be) few and far between. (Remember: this is largely, though not entirely, a stealth game.)', 'The PlayStation 4s extra horsepower also gives a boost to The Last of Us graphical fidelity. Now, I know thats not necessarily saying a whole lot, considering The Last of Us on PS3 is already the most beautiful game Ive seen on any console. But somehow, Remastered looks just a bit better. Textures are more detailed, the lighting is enhanced, and everything pops more.', 'The changes arent mind altering  or even game changing  but you can absolutely see the difference. From the moment I started the campaign, I couldnt help but notice improvements everywhere. Some are far more minor than others, but theyre there, and they make The Last of Us burst with even more life.', 'You can really soak the beauty in with Remastereds new Photo Mode, which allows you to take control of the camera, alter visual settings like focus and filters, and more to grab the most gorgeous shots possible. Its not uncommon to encounter stunning sights in The Last of Us  like when you first enter environments reclaimed by nature with Joel and Tess near the beginning of the game  and now, you can capture those moments for posterity, if youd like.', 'Another notable change from PS3 to PS4 is, as you might expect, the controller. Naughty Dog knew the weaknesses of the DualShock 3s terrible triggers, which explains why aiming and shooting was unconventionally mapped to R1 and L1. DualShock 4s far superior triggers dont suffer from a similar problem, so you can map shooting to R2 and L2 if you want, or keep it as it originally was.', 'Your backpack menu can be brought up with the DualShock 4s meaty center button, too. And, like Killzone: Shadow Fall, the controllers speaker can be used to play audio diaries and sound effects like the on/off click of your flashlight, though you can turn this off if you find it too obnoxious.', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', '', '', '', '', '', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement', 'For as great as Remastereds little tweaks and additions are, the true value proposition comes in when you start to talk about DLC. A slew of DLC that had to be purchased separately on PlayStation 3 comes bundled-in on PlayStation 4. For instance, Left Behind  The Last of Us incredible single-player prequel DLC  is included (read the original review here), as are a ton of online maps and modes that youd otherwise have to acquire separately on PS3.', ' ', 'And yes, playing The Last of Us: Remastered online is just as awesome as it was the first time around, again aided by a silky-smooth framerate. I suspect the surprising online addiction The Last of Us provided in 2013 will be renewed for some and discovered for the first time for others.']",IGN
255,Dynasty Warriors: Gundam Reborn,10-Jul-14,Jared Petty,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/10/dynasty-warriors-gundam-reborn-review,"['With an admirable single-minded commitment to simple escapism, Dynasty Warriors: Gundam Reborn dropped me in the cockpit of a death-dealing space samurai mech. It launched me into the heart of a deep-space armada, and applauded as I enthusiastically stabbed, shot, battered, blasted, and disintegrated a thousand colossal enemy robots.', 'The heart of Gundam Reborn is a meaty Official Mode, a six part, 20-hour story campaign covering several Gundam series. Advancing through the mission paths unlocked branching difficulty trees, which encouraged me to grind resources for the Gundam and pilot customization systems to keep up with the steepening challenge. My more obsessive-compulsive tendencies were rewarded as I found myself mixing and matching abilities, special weapons, partners, skills, and attributes to generate optimal builds.', 'Grinding resources is rewarding, thanks to flashy weaponry. Every swipe of my saber had a satisfying heft as I hurled legions of armored foes airborne. My ranged weapons were almost as impressive, bathing vast swaths of the battlefield in a colorful cacophony of destruction. Combination moves are easy to learn and execute, and I quickly fell into a simple pattern of slashes followed up by an occasional ranged charge shot or stylish finish executed purely for aesthetic flair. The clumsy flight and jumping systems were less well-defined, so theres no real sense of verticality here. The repetition of fighting on whats effectively a 2D plane became almost rhythmic, a hypnotic pattern of destruction broken up by alerts summoning me to the far side of the stage.', 'The tension and challenge of Gundam Reborn arose not from the brawling, but from understanding and traversing the larger battle. Zipping from one end of a map to the other to seize a new control point, rescue a friend, or shoot down an enemy starship was both thrilling and demanding. It was frustrating, though, that a couple of maps didnt give me enough information to know where I needed to be when. They required a replay or two to learn through trial and error.', 'A few battles against some truly gargantuan enemies suffer from a sloppy body-part targeting system, but the engagements against enemy Aces are more rewarding. I often tried to roll over these rivals with brute force, but sometimes Id get a little cuter or craftier, ducking, weaving, and sniping until they were weakened and vulnerable.', 'Handling characteristics and move sets of the pilotable mobile suits are distinct enough that I definitely noticed when I switched between them, and I developed a strong preference for the Jack-of-all-trades balance of speed and firepower of the Mk I Gundam. In fact, I found myself resenting story missions that forced me out of that cockpit.', 'Gundam Reborn rewards aggressiveness, but sometimes the fast pace led me to outrun the melodramatic in-game dialogue. A few times I found defeated rivals would continue to trash-talk me for several seconds after Id blasted them to pieces, as I was forced to float around in limbo until they were finished. No biggie, but a little weird.', 'I wish there was more to look at than generic steel walls or a bland starfield. With all the enemies milling about, the strained resources of my poor PS3 didnt have much time left to draw terrain, backgrounds, or much of anything else. The mobile suits themselves are passable, but the universe is plain ugly.', '\n\n', '', 'The action is interspersed by competent CG cutscenes and occasional still-frame 2D dialogues drawn to resemble the Gundam cartoons. Everything can be skipped, a welcome feature when I just wanted to get back to killing more mobile suits, but theres quite a bit of story included for those who are interested. The lack of English voice work probably works in its favor, as the exaggerated script would have sounded pretty silly spoken aloud.', 'After completing Official Mode, I had a blast playing around with the more open-ended Ultimate Modes all-star jam of pilots and mechs from across the Gundam properties. I mixed and matched favorite characters in impossible duels that bridged Gundams canonical historic periods. Ultimate Mode is a fertile playground for experimenting with my Gundam upgrades and pilot configurations, and I appreciated a medal system that rewarded me for flying some of the weaker mechs for a greater challenge.', 'Two-player couch co-op is alright, though the vertically-split screen feels pretty cramped and things slow down quite a bit. I welcomed the presence of the online SOS-mode, which allowed me to request player assistance on particularly difficult stages.']",IGN
256,Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark,27-Jun-14,Dave Rudden,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/27/transformers-rise-of-the-dark-spark-review,"['A Transformers game really only has to deliver on two simple things: make it fun to transform, and make it fun to destroy robots. Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark is a dud on both of those fronts, and it throws in a confusing story to boot.', ""Rise of the Dark Spark has a simple storyline about the bad guys wanting to find the Dark Spark and the good guys trying to stop them. That should make for a straightforward campaign, but a few factors derail the plot. Whereas previous Transformers games, War for Cybertron and Fall of Cybertron, had separate Autobot and Decepticon campaigns, Rise of the Dark Sparks 14-mission campaign switches between sides without much reason or notice, and unevenly at that. In the middle of the Decepticons capturing the important relic, you jump to an Autobot mission where they're on the hunt, and after the halfway point, the Decepticon's side of the story just stops being told as the Autobots march towards their inevitable victory. The switches are jarring enough that you might forget which side you're on at more than one point during the early stages."", ""Whats even more confusing is that in order to tie into the concurrently released Transformers: Age of Extinction movie, Rise of the Dark Spark's entire cast sports the same faux-gritty style of the films, where little separates the factions besides a tiny logo. Aside from the always-game Peter Cullen reprising his role as Optimus Prime, there's few noteworthy performances from the rest of the cast. Jazz tries to be the comic relief, but has nothing funny to say, Drift counterbalances his unique design by being exceedingly dull, and the Decepticons only come in two flavors: cackling underlings and brooding leaders."", 'The dull audio and level design extends outward, as the soundtrack is a grating Hans Zimmer-style bombast mixed with dubstep, while the stages alternate towards bland, dilapidated Earth cities and samey labyrinth outer-space bases. The few times Rise of the Dark Spark dares to venture outside on other planets it makes for memorable diversions, but those levels are rare exceptions.', ""Shooting is serviceable, largely due to a pretty impressive suite of weapons. Each of the 20 guns you wield in robot form has a very distinct style, from standards like the semi-automatic and shotgun to more esoteric ideas like an electric beam that chains between enemies, a slime cannon that slows down and poisons enemies, and Dead Space-like blade and bolo shooters. However, the enemies you'll use them on aren't much fun to fight with. With the exception of the uniquely shielded Titan Decepticon troops, enemies have few intelligent tactics. The ones that lack overpowered weapons will perform extreme evasive maneuvers that are doubly frustrating, since you usually need to clear out all enemies in particular sections to progress. Mindless, unsatisfying melee strikes dont add anything. There are special attacks unique to each Transformer, but theyre either overpowered in cases like Drift's sword slice, or useless, like Sharpshot's cloaking ability."", ""The nail in the coffin is that vehicular transformations fail to spice up the combat. If the Transformer you're playing as turns into a car, you can expect clunky turning and a dire lack of a sense of speed, even if you engage both boost and turbo; why there are two separate speed boost buttons is a mystery. The air-based transformations aren't as bad, but since there's no radar, tracking down flying enemies is an annoying game of hide and seek. And for some reason theres only one Dinobot and one Insecticon transformation during the campaign, but plenty to choose from exclusively in multiplayer. Seems like a waste."", ""Outside of upgrading your guns with larger clips, quicker reloads, and bonuses specific to each weapon, the rest of Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark's progression systems fall flat. Unlockable Gear Boxes function much like the customization packs in Mass Effect 3 or Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare. However, there's just too much inside these packs. Between the weapon upgrades, new weapons, additional multiplayer characters, multiplayer-only abilities, T.E.C.H perks, and Hack difficulty modifiers that work like Halo's skulls, the process of slowly sifting through each item becomes boring fast."", ""It's slightly less annoying to open Gear Boxes while preparing your character for the online co-op Escalation mode, which is sort of a microcosm for the mode itself. Pitting you and up to three teammates against 15 waves of progressively more difficult enemies on eight well-designed maps, there's a sense of urgency in Escalation, whether it be as you race to revive a teammate or scour the map to replenish or replace a weapon running low on ammo. Escalation doesn't have the epic boss encounters of Gears of War's Horde mode, the alternate objectives of Mass Effect 3, or the insane extraction endings of Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare's Garden Ops, but it's still the most entertaining part of Rise of the Dark Spark."", ""Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark is available on seven different platforms, a 3DS strategy game (not reviewed here), and a action-shooter that plays similarly on PC, PS3, PS4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, and Wii U. On the PC, PS4, and Xbox One, the game runs smoothly, though there are a few spots where textures are too low res to fit in with the highly detailed robots themselves. On the PS3, Xbox 360, and Wii U, expect muddy textures, jaggy character models, and pretty awful pop-in on buildings and complicated textures, especially noticeable on things like chain link fences. On the Wii U, the Game Pad simply mirrors what's being shown on your TV screen; there's no touch-pad usage or additional info to glean on the screen. Also, the Wii U version does not include the multiplayer Escalation mode.""]",IGN
257,Battle Princess of Arcadias,30-Jun-14,Meghan Sullivan,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/30/battle-princess-of-arcadias,"['Battle Princess of Arcadias wasnt announced with much fanfare, but I sat up and took notice anyway. It immediately reminded me of games like Odin Sphere and Grim Grimoire, and since Im a huge Vanillaware fan, I knew I had to play it. I cant say that Battle Princess can go toe to toe with Odin Sphere, but it is bubbly mix of beat em up, role-playing, and strategy kept me smiling the whole time I played it.', 'The first thing I noticed about Battle Princess is its bright and beautiful world, which sets it apart from the more common drab, post-apocalyptic look of so many other games about a world in need of a savior. Its clear that developer Apollosoft took its art direction cues from Vanillaware (forests and mountains look like theyre copied directly from Odin Sphere), and Battle Princess does a good job capturing the vibrant color palette. Unfortunately, it also looks like an old Flash game, based on the at times flat and choppy quality of the animation. I was relieved to find that choppiness doesnt affect the gameplay in any way, since much of Battle Princess fun lies in the fast-paced combat.', 'Three different combat modes are available: regular combat, skirmishes and sieges. Combat is by far the easiest and most enjoyable mode for me  I loved cutting down enemies using the red-haired protagonist Plume and her Princess Corp. (a group of nine playable companions that accompany the battle princess wherever she goes). Well mapped-out and responsive controls make it smooth and easy to set up 100-hit combos of light, strong, and special attacks, which kept the action zipping along. I also like being able to quickly swap out characters in combat by tapping the R1 button, letting me take advantage of each characters special weapon type (sword, spear, gun, etc.) and skill set, which proved to be useful against the myriad different enemies that appeared on the battlefield. Best of all, when things got hairy I could use built-up skill points to unleash a massive group attack that instantly destroyed everything in its path.', 'If Combat was the easiest mode for me to learn, then Skirmish was by far the most challenging. In these brigade vs. brigade melees, Plume and Co. are joined by a separate band of fighters who take on enemy forces in the background. Like the Princess Corp., the brigade is made up of units that specialize in one weapon type, and successfully fighting enemy forces meant ensuring these units always went up against opponents with weaker weapon types. Otherwise the entire brigade would be wiped out in a hurry. I had to constantly switch tactics and swap out fighting units in the background, while simultaneously attacking enemies with Princess Corp. members in the foreground. Its a tough juggling act, but when I finally got the swing of things I began to welcome the challenge of trying to attack enemies on two different fronts at the same time.', 'The third branch of combat is Siege mode, which involves the Princess Corp. leading the brigade directly into battle against huge bosses. It wasnt as difficult as Skirmish mode, since all brigade units are on the field at once, but it wasnt as exciting either. Since the entire brigade was involved, I had to make sure each unit was properly leveled up or these mega bosses would destroy them, which was the most tedious part of Battle Princess combat.', 'Thats because Brigade units can only be as strong as their corresponding Princess Corp member. (For example, if sword-wielding Plume is level 8, the brigades fencers can only be level 8. If her right-hand man Raltz is level 7, archers can only be level 7). Unfortunately, since you can only choose three Princess Corp. members to take with you on a mission, I had to do a lot of level grinding in order to ensure all 10 playable characters and their corresponding brigades were strong enough to take on the tough enemies found in Siege mode. This slowed down the pace of things considerably, which naturally I wasnt too keen on.', '', 'Care Bear...STARE!', 'At the end of the day the level-grinding was worth it though, because it allowed me to take pride whenever my brigade overcame tough odds. Better yet, level grinding allowed me to listen to my favorite Battle Princess tunes over and over again. Im absolutely wild about soundtrack, which is a mix of light, ethereal pieces and fast tempoed J-pop (think Japanese composer Hitoshi Sakimoto meets Perfume).', 'I wish I could tell you the story and characters are as amazing as the soundtrack and combat, but I cant. The story is boring. Basically its just Princess Plume and her friends fighting a group of mysterious beings that want to take over the world. With the exception of a few small twists and turns, thats it. Never once in the nearly 30 hours I spent playing Battle Princess did I ever find myself on the edge of my seat.', 'As for the characters, Princess Plume and her friends are nothing more than the typical anime/JRPG tropes Ive seen before: Plume is the cheerful, brainless leader, Raltz her sweet but naive right-hand man, Deishe is the weird, skeevy perve, Marianne is the other weird, skeevy perve, Rudolph the brutish loudmouth, and so on. I admit there were a couple of genuinely funny character interactions (the constant fighting for Raltzs attention amongst Princess Corp. members is an example), but for the most part I found talking to people to be grating or downright creepy, as many scenarios involved adults trying to hit on minors.', '', 'I smite you with color!', 'Luckily, you can actually skip conversations all together if you want, so most of my time between battles was spent on the much more fun task of upgrading weapons and accessories. If I knew the next mission involved going to an icy mountain full of physically tough monsters, I could equip characters with fire-based weapons and higher attack levels. Plume can also level up individual units of her brigade while off the battlefield, though doing so got to be quite costly as my brigades levels got higher. Then again, I had so much money by the end of Plumes adventures that it wasnt too much of a problem.']",IGN

Yet developer DrinkBox didn\'t just give Guacamelee! a slight change here and a little reworking there while porting it to virtually every platform under the sun (Xbox 360, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Wii U). This really is more of a ""1.5 version (think Soul Sacrifice Delta to Soul Sacrifice), so even if you\'ve 100%\'d and Platinum\'d Guacamelee! back in the day like I did, there are plenty of reasons to go back for more apart from experiencing an amazing game again.', ""With some new tweaks, the inclusion of all its DLC, and an unexpectedly large chunk of all-new content, Juan's Metroidvania-style platforming adventure maintains that goofy undead luchadore heart and soul a bit longer. Little changes, like life bars above enemies and the inclusion of silver coins that allow you to buy costumes in-game, are barely noticeable in the grand scheme of things. Whats important are whole new areas of the map to explore, some never-before-seen enemies to fight, and even a new boss that works his way into cutscenes and the overall story."", '', ""You didn't see this in the original."", ""These new areas, like the rest of Guacamelee!, are stunning to look at, fun to play through, and throw their own mixture of platforming and enemy-based challenges at you. Some of these aforementioned enemy-centric challenges come by way of new foes that add a dynamic layer upon the game's already exceptional combo-based combat. Some of these foes, marked with black outlines, can disappear and reappear at will, making them wily and unpredictable combatants. Much of Guacamelee!'s challenge comes more from exceptional feats of platforming than it does from actual, difficult fights, but these guys change the formula up a bit. And an all-new boss enemy -- El Trio de la Muerte -- isn't only humorously designed, but integrated well into Guacamelee's already existing narrative with nary a hiccup."", 'One change I wasn\'t incredibly fond of, however, was the new ability to go into ""Intenso"" mode. By filling up a new bar underneath your health and special ability meters, Juan can charge himself up and go ballistic on enemies for a short period of time, busting heads while barely breaking a sweat. Since the crux of Guacamelee! continues to revolve around its awesome grappling and combo systems, going Intenso felt forced, and throws away a lot of Guacamelee!\'s more nuanced and satisfying combat in lieu of button mashing-type, seconds-long frays that seem out of place. Ultimately, I found its inclusion unnecessary. Still, since you have a third meter to keep track of, that means more collectibles to find to upgrade said meter, which is awesome.', '', ""Kick, punch, it's all in the mind."", ""Perhaps STCE's most substantial addition comes in the form of the inclusion of El Infierno, which was an add-on DLC pack on PS3 and Vita that gives you a series challenge rooms to try and overcome. All of that is included in STCE right off the bat, extending Guacamelee!'s admittedly short playtime. That playtime -- which may take between five and seven hours, depending on how thorough you are -- is still my biggest gripe. Guacamelee! is too damn short, which is, frankly, a testament to how good it is. I wish it was 15 or 20 hours long like some of the Metroidvania games that so clearly inspired it.""]",IGN

Taking Firaxis famously addictive turn-based strategy series about guiding a nation from cavedwellers to spacefarers and trying to make that work as a quick and easy iPad game has, predictably, met with mixed results. Civilization Revolution 2 certainly does have trace amounts of that just one more turn momentum and tension, and it has the trademark hilariously warlike Gandhi, but its a pale shadow of the greatness of the full Civilization games.', 'Picking one of the 18 nicely varied leaders, ranging from Abraham Lincoln to Genghis Khan to a slightly disturbingly sexed-up version of Catherine the Great, and jumping onto a randomized map of colorful terrain squares works well with the iPads touch controls. Bonuses like the Romans half-price roads and the Mongols ability to conquer barbarian camps and turn them into free settlements really set them apart. However, if this is your first Civ Rev game, it might take a few games to learn crucial aspects of combat and trade that the tutorial and the surprisingly sparse Civilopedia dont bother to tell you.', 'Whats weird is, outside of the combat, that lack of information doesnt matter very much. I actually ended up winning my first couple of three to four-hour games on King and Emperor difficulty without fully understanding how that happened. At least the several different victory conditions, like going for culture instead of conquest or trying to build a spaceship to colonize other worlds, made starting again worthwhile.', 'Once youve got the hang of things, it does become pretty easy to control an expanding army and empire of cities. You dont have to worry about things like improving terrain, because most of the improvements to your cities resources come from automatic upgrades to technology instead of managing workers. That simplification works pretty well, but some of the other steps taken to minimize micromanagement end up creating some pretty dull busywork.', '', ""That's as much of the world as you can see at one time."", 'For example: In order to be effective in combat, you have to combine three identical units, such as three warriors, into one super army unit that combines their attack and defense stats. Thats fine, but after the first few battles I started to wonder why these completely ineffective single units exist at all if they dont stand a chance against anything but an enemy settler. There isnt even the possibility of mixing and matching different unit types into a squad to complement each others weaknesses. So whats the point?', 'Even more annoying: you cant pay gold to upgrade outdated units, like when warriors are replaced in the build menu by legions. So if youve got a lone warrior, you cant build two more warriors to make an army, and you cant disband the existing warrior for gold, either. Hes just fodder. That forces you to constantly build entirely new units to sit on top of the existing defenders in every city, which creates more hassle when it comes to finding the unit you want.

Civ Rev 2 doesnt give you a way to view the entire planet, either with a small map or by zooming out far enough to get a perspective on things, so its hard to be aware of the global situation. When I started running away with a game and getting near victory, I kept getting declarations of war from civilizations without really knowing where they are relative to me and if I should care.']",IGN
260,Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark,1-Jul-14,Dave Rudden,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/01/transformers-rise-of-the-dark-spark-wii-u-review,"[""A Transformers game really only has to deliver on two simple things: make it fun to transform, and make it fun to destroy robots. Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark is a dud on both of those fronts, and it throws in a confusing story to boot. Worse, the Wii U version doesn't even have the online co-op that slightly redeems this game on other platforms."", ""Rise of the Dark Spark has a simple storyline about the bad guys wanting to find the Dark Spark and the good guys trying to stop them. That should make for a straightforward campaign, but a few factors derail the plot. Whereas previous Transformers games, War for Cybertron and Fall of Cybertron, had separate Autobot and Decepticon campaigns or at least transitioned between factions coherently, Rise of the Dark Sparks 14-mission campaign switches sides without much reason or notice, and unevenly at that. In the middle of the Decepticons capturing the important relic, you jump to an Autobot mission where they're on the hunt, and after the halfway point, the Decepticon's side of the story just stops being told as the Autobots march towards their inevitable victory. The switches are jarring enough that you might forget which side you're on at more than one point during the early stages."", ""Whats even more confusing is that in order to tie into the concurrently released Transformers: Age of Extinction movie, Rise of the Dark Spark's entire cast sports the same faux-gritty style of the films, where little separates the factions besides a tiny logo. Aside from the always-game Peter Cullen reprising his role as Optimus Prime, there's few noteworthy performances from the rest of the cast. Jazz tries to be the comic relief, but has nothing funny to say, Drift counterbalances his unique design by being exceedingly dull, and the Decepticons only come in two flavors: cackling underlings and brooding leaders."", 'The dull audio and level design extends outward, as the soundtrack is a grating Hans Zimmer-style bombast mixed with dubstep, while the stages alternate towards bland, dilapidated Earth cities and samey labyrinth outer-space bases. The few times Rise of the Dark Spark dares to venture outside on other planets it makes for memorable diversions, but those levels are rare exceptions.', ""Shooting is serviceable, largely due to a pretty impressive suite of weapons. Each of the 20 guns you wield in robot form has a very distinct style, from standards like the semi-automatic and shotgun to more esoteric ideas like an electric beam that chains between enemies, a slime cannon that slows down and poisons enemies, and Dead Space-like blade and bolo shooters. However, the enemies you'll use them on aren't much fun to fight with. With the exception of the uniquely shielded Titan Decepticon troops, enemies have few intelligent tactics. The ones that lack overpowered weapons will perform extreme evasive maneuvers that are doubly frustrating, since you usually need to clear out all enemies in particular sections to progress. Mindless, unsatisfying melee strikes dont add anything. There are special attacks unique to each Transformer, but theyre either overpowered in cases like Drift's sword slice, or useless, like Sharpshot's cloaking ability."", ""The nail in the coffin is that vehicular transformations fail to spice up the combat. If the Transformer you're playing as turns into a car, you can expect clunky turning and a dire lack of a sense of speed, even if you engage both boost and turbo; why there are two separate speed boost buttons is a mystery. The air-based transformations aren't as bad, but since there's no radar, tracking down flying enemies is an annoying game of hide and seek. And for some reason theres only one Dinobot and one Insecticon transformation during the campaign, but plenty to choose from exclusively in multiplayer. Seems like a waste."", ""Rise of the Dark Spark on Wii U is by far the worst version available. While the visuals are at the same level as the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 (meaning muddy textures, jaggy character models, and pretty awful pop-in on buildings and complicated textures), the Wii U version lacks the biggest redeeming value of every other non-Nintendo platform: the multiplayer Escalation mode. Furthermore the GamePad support is incredible anemic, as it simply mirrors what's being shown on your TV screen; there's no touchpad usage (not even for menus) or additional info to glean on the screen.""]",IGN
261,Don Bradman Cricket,2-Jul-14,Tristan Ogilvie,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/02/don-bradman-cricket-14-pc-review,"['What a difference a few months can make. When it arrived on PS3 and Xbox 360 in early April 2014, Don Bradman Cricket 14 was a seriously ambitious yet notably flawed cricket simulation in serious need of post-release patching (click here for the original console version review). It essentially felt like it was released a couple of months too early; the recipe was good but the dish was undercooked. But credit where it is due: developer Big Ant has listened to fans and continued to refine the game in the subsequent months, and those tweaks are all evident in the PC release of the game along with an appreciable bump to the visuals and loading times. In short, Don Bradman Cricket 14 on PC can lay a genuine claim to being the finest cricket game ever made.', 'Big Ant has clearly asked for the heavy rollers to flatten out the kinks in Don Bradman Cricket 14s pitch. The tweaks are numerous, but what really becomes clear during match play is how much more balanced the game feels overall. Nowhere is this more evident than in the way the fielders have been stripped of their superpowers. Previously they leapt out of telephone booths to Superman-snare every catch that came their way, and nailed direct-hits with every shy at the pegs as though the ball was tethered to middle stump with industrial-strength elastic. Now they move slower, throw with varying accuracy and just generally behave like elite sportsmen who are nonetheless mere mortals.', 'But there are plenty of other fixes. Non-striker batsmen no longer dawdle a metre out of their crease with RUN ME OUT signs sticky-taped to their backs. Stumps can now be knocked out of the ground when a batsman is bowled. Fielders dont compulsively take the bails off even when a batsman is far back enough in his crease to sign autographs. Edges to the slips and gully occur at a more realistic rate. Youre given the option of enabling the onscreen bowling guides no matter which difficulty setting youre on. The list goes on.', '', '""I knew fixing cricket games could be a good thing!"" said Lou Vincent.', 'The previously notable disparity in difficulty between batting and bowling also seems to have been addressed, and in particular the addition of Rookie and Amateur settings to the Career mode means that the journey from domestic debutant to international superstar doesnt have to be such a stiff slog. Levelling up your batting attributes is also a faster process thanks to the 60 balls youre permitted to face in the nets between each match  a seriously valuable opportunity to increase your stats minus the risk and vulnerability of being out in the middle.', 'When there are so fewer things to gripe about, it makes it easier to focus on the hundreds of little things that the game gets right. Like how the AI will often use a DRS referral out of desperation rather than genuine dispute - such as when its nine wickets down and has just been given out trapped plumb in front - because thats exactly what most human batsmen would do. Or how inside edges might cannon into the stumps, or agonisingly close to them, or even into the thigh pad, and just generally adhere to the laws of physics rather than an animators scripting. Or even how the ground announcer will occasionally make announcements unrelated to the match  such as notifying parents of lost children and so on. With most of its flaws eradicated, Don Bradman Cricket 14 consistently captures the feel of the sport more so than any cricket game before it.', 'Bugs are still evident, but they are mostly confined to the games presentation elements. During one innings my team score of 5/550 suddenly switched to 0/0 after a lunch break, only to revert to the correct score the following ball. In my career the game insisted on labelling the non-striker batsman with the name of my created player, despite the fact I was bowling at the time. Meanwhile the TV-style overlay frequently credited wickets as being caught and bowled even when they werent, and instant replays didnt always automatically trigger after a wicket. Yet all of these were minor issues that never impacted on the actual gameplay in a negative way.', ""A couple of the other gripes I had with the console game still persist, namely the fact that spin-bowling still feels overly laborious compared with pace-bowling to the point that I rarely bowl spin unless I absolutely have to, and the game still lacks on onscreen fielding radar. However, the latter is at least mitigated somewhat by the fact youre no longer surrounded by 11 superhuman ball-magnets whenever you arrive at the batting crease, and the labelling of fielders when you're checking the field in first-person view makes it much easier to spot the gaps."", '', 'Spin bowling remains a bit too fiddly.', 'The inability to play the game in multiplayer co-operatively remains an odd omission from both the PC game and the console release, especially considering that the sport of cricket is so dependent on playing in partnerships. Hopefully this is something Big Ant can add in the future  theyve certainly proved their commitment to improving the game thus far.', ""Meanwhile the loading times have been shortened considerably in the PC version, and it's much faster to hop in and out of matches and bring up menus. As you may expect the PC game is also the best looking version of Don Bradman Cricket 14, although it hasnt received a huge overhaul. Still, everything looks noticeably sharper at 1080p, and there are welcome visual enhancements such as depth of field and lighting effects. Of note is the subtle way sunlight is reflected off the manufacturers stickers on your bat when its held aloft after a crunching cover drive (although those placeholder advertisements for Chicken remain just as ugly at a higher resolution)."", 'Of course the phony boundary ads could quickly become eradicated in the PC version of Don Bradman Cricket 14 in the event that its embraced by the modding community in the same way that EAs Cricket 07 has been previously. Already there are user-created patches to swap in real team logos and the like, and coupled with the excellent in-game customisation tools supplied by Big Ant, Don Bradman Cricket 14 on PC could increasingly resemble a fully-licensed sports game as the months go on should players take the time to tinker with it.', '(Note: at the time of writing, patch 2.0 - which contains most of the fixes and tweaks present in the PC game - was awaiting approval with Microsoft and Sony for the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions. So sometime in the near future, console owners should have an experience  visual upgrades and modding aside  on par with this PC release).']",IGN
262,Sniper Elite III,26-Jun-14,Mikel Reparaz,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/26/sniper-elite-iii-review,"[""Sniper Elite III is a celebration of extravagant carnage - and, less significantly, a big improvement over 2012's Sniper Elite V2. Its predecessor's stiff, linear gameplay has been swapped out for a more open-ended, creativity-enabling approach to stealth-shooting. But the big draw  the real draw  is the same pornographically violent X-ray-vision carnage that erupts whenever your bullets meet their targets."", 'These slow-motion, long-range kills are what keep Sniper Elite III from being just another generic-looking World War II shooter. Every effort was made to milk them for dramatic tension. When aiming, you can hold your breath, slowing time so you can watch that red dot shrink in on your target. Tight close-ups of the bullet in flight are accompanied by a steadily swelling roar, giving your shot a sense of impending destiny. Provided your reaction to the resulting gore is a sick thrill and not actual sickness, this is so immensely satisfying that it renders every other weapon at your disposal anticlimactic by comparison.', ""The kill-cam moments never got old enough for me to opt to skip them, but they might have if the rest of Sniper Elite III weren't so competently designed. Centering on Karl, a gravel-voiced American sniper, who seems to almost singlehandedly dismantle the German Afrika Korps, you are taken to a lot of interesting settings in a theater of the war that's rarely explored in games, and given semi-free rein to explore and murder Nazi occupiers in whatever way you deem fit. Thats what gives Sniper Elite III its edge - and not its story, which is awash in cliches and occasionally laughable dialogue."", ""The campaign consists of just eight stages, but theyre a blast to creep through. Each one is enormous and has multiple objectives meant to give you a clear progression through the map, but how you reach and tackle those objectives is up to you. And when you factor in handfuls of enjoyable optional tasks, like blowing up a German motor pool or stealing top-secret plans, and the many deaths you're likely to die, finishing a single level can take as long as a couple of hours."", ""With a guard AI thatll usually spot you if you run or even poke your head up above cover, Sniper Elite III encourages you to take it slow and stealthy, spotting and tagging guards with your binoculars. And should you decide to take a shot with anything but your silenced pistol  like, say, your sniper rifle  it's a good idea to either be near some noisy machinery that'll cover up the sound, or immediately move somewhere else after you take your shot."", ""This push to relocate gives Sniper Elite III a fun, furtive cat-and-mouse feel, although like most stealth games, it doesn't always make sense; all you need to do is sneak or run a prescribed distance away from the guards until they forget you ever existed."", ""But remember, there's no penalty for breaking stealth  and because you mainly earn experience through kills, there's no real reason not to clutter the horizon with bodies if you can get away with it. Dropping guards in quick succession always left me feeling like an efficient badass, even when it was due more to their uneven combat AI than my own skill."", ""Sniper Elite III's multiplayer maps are huge and filled with hiding places, and they're built to emphasize distance and sneakiness. In fact, two of the standout modes are Distance King and No Cross, which respectively reward teams based on the range of their kills, and separate them with impassable barriers meant to force them to snipe. These modes are enjoyable, but they're not fundamentally different from what you'd find in any other online shooter. Co-op, on the other hand, is much more rewarding. Not only can you tackle the entire campaign with a buddy, but you can also pair up in the waves-of-Nazis Survival mode and the engrossing Overwatch, which hands binoculars to one player and a rifle to the other, forcing you to work together as a sniper-spotter team.""]",IGN
263,WildStar,26-Jun-14,Brandin Tyrrel,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/26/wildstar-review,"['Like the countless alien adventurers already descending into the mystery of planet Nexus, WildStar is itself a stranger in a strange land. As the newest massively multiplayer roleplaying game in an already crowded genre, it has an uphill battle in winning a piece of that market  and further still, keeping it engaging enough to warrant the monthly subscription fee. To compensate, developer Carbine Studios has cast the widest possible net by striving to cater to both casual players and the hardcore MMORPG player, a sizeable feat rather deftly accomplished by sticking to the formula thats found success, while fleshing out new ideas therein.', 'In that regard, WildStar is of course not the next evolution of the modern MMORPG. Instead, its much more the culmination of a decades worth of experimentation and design, cherry-picked and enhanced, and infused with Carbines twists and light-hearted flourish. While some may find the lack of bold new directions disappointing, thats less a criticism of WildStar and more of the genre as a whole  WildStar isnt rewriting the book, as much as it is penning the sequel.', 'Be Like Water', 'WildStars eight playable races are divvied up comfortably between two factions both vying for control of Nexus  the forgotten homeworld of the Eldan, a hyper-advanced race  which neatly sets the tone for a familiar two-sided confrontation. But even with the Dominion-Exile conflict now raging across the planets surface, your adventurer is the least interesting parts of this saga. The greater story lies in Nexus secrets, and while occasional bursts of dialog and quest text remind you of your heroic stature, WildStar ultimately falls prey to narrative issues common in MMORPGs -- painting you as the lone savior while you watch your same feats completed by a rotating door of adventurers.', 'Much of WildStars real story is locked away in voiced data recordings, welcome yet sporadic cinematics, and an in-game encyclopedia. Theres no shortage of lore should you go looking for it, but the finer points are easy to miss while leveling and eventually culminate into an anticlimactic finale (at least until endgame content and a future patch furthers the storyline.) Still, WildStars scattered story arc is less of a draw than the colorful, carefree personality on display in every fiber of the planet and the particularly excellent voice work and character animations.', ""Nexus isn't necessarily geographically larger than most MMOs, but it gives a sense of mammoth scale: it's comprised of over a dozen independent zones across three continents and an orbiting celestial body. But Nexus instills a pervasive feeling of insignificance when facing the antiquated relics and natural wonders towering overhead, and its often stunning to behold from the tops of those vantages, overlooking its motley biomes and colossal setpieces. Its bright and boisterous and ready to be explored  which is recommended thanks to the many hidden secrets and achievements stashed off the beaten path. Yet the planet is more than just a pretty face: every sloping hill is a potential hoverboard ramp; spontaneous tornadoes ready to whip you through the air and lingering pockets of radiation are environmental hazards to be avoided; and entire environments add new tweaks to the established physics, as is the case in Farside, an entire zone on Nexus moon where gravitys grip is noticeably weakened."", 'Its clear that mobility is a core tenet of WildStar, with so much emphasis on fast, fluid motions. Double-jumping and sprinting add interactive elements to movement, the benefits of which are exponentially noticeable atop a mount or hoverboard. Combat is similarly transformed into an action-oriented dance of precision target painting and chaotic dodges. While many MMORPGs rely on a passive skills to hit or miss based on the roll of the dice, WildStars attacks all occupy actual space and are visualized by colored telegraphs upon the ground. It can be challenging to juggle precise movements while lining up the shots of a hearty skill rotation, and dodging enemy attacks, but its entirely rewarding and prohibits combat from ever growing truly stale.', 'Its refreshing that such a seemingly basic ingredient as movement can be this engaging, since the bulk of the WildStar experience is a constant state of travel and combat within the now-customary questing system. Yes, you will fetch and harvest hundreds of items, and eventually lose count of the creatures youve slain at the behest of a golden question mark, but this too has been touched by Carbines penchant for accessibility. Some quests can be auto-completed out in the field, mitigating the drudgery of returning to the giver for the next link in the chain, and small interactive flourishes like quick-time events and color-sequence puzzles introduce a welcome action element to otherwise-mundane tasks. Standout quests that find you literally filling out paperwork for ProtoStar Corporation and running down space zombies on a supercharged motorcycle are but a few of the highlights that flesh out the traditional MMO fare with a tinge of WildStars clever personality.', 'Questing difficulty sharply spikes in the mid-30 levels, and its here that WildStars open tagging, easy-to-navigate quest tracking, and generally welcoming community are most important. Anecdotally, the community in WildStar is one of the best Ive experienced, both out in the field and in the chat channels of the capital cities: mostly helpful, usually playful, and rarely cruel.', 'Weapon of Choice', 'The choice in class is the first and largest decision you make on Nexus, and to Carbines credit, its impossible to go too far wrong. Each of the six classes feel mechanically unique and handle differently, though all are capable of holding their own when it comes to dishing out damage, as well as supporting a party in a healer or tank role. The secret is WildStars devious Limited Action Set system, which restricts your action bar to eight skills at any one time, forcing tough decisions tailored to each new fight revolving around how youll allocate points that increase those abilities potency and add new effects. I love the system for its easy-to-understand complexity, but its potential downside is its branching talent tree: The AMP system. Each AMP acts like a talent that modifies your character, and can be unlocked and purchased with AMP Points acquired with each level. The catch is the more powerful AMPs require a physical component to be found or purchased in the world before the AMP becomes available. As a Spellslinger, the sought-after physical component of the Trigger Fingers AMP commands an extortionate price in the auction house due to its low world drop rate, preventing me from getting the most of my class for now.', 'Fortunately there are plenty of other ways to spend WildStars many in-game currencies, and crafting is chief among them. While the traditional tradeskills are all represented, crafting infuses puzzle and strategy elements to put some excitement and activity into its traditionally passive nature. For example, a Technologist crafts potions, boosts, and gadgets by purchasing ingredients that shift crosshairs on an X-Y plane, the goal being to discover or hit the craftable youre aiming for, which is easier said than done. Initially complicated, especially once crafting talents and tech trees come into play, the system is actually rewarding for its depth and interactive elements, though its extremely expensive due to the trial and error inherent in the process.', 'Separate from the six playable classes, WildStars noteworthy Path system is comprised of four secondary occupations, each with their own tasks that pepper every zone with opportunities for a satisfying change of pace and near-constant distraction. As a Settler, my path maintains infrastructure and civic works through building repair and the construction of buff dispensers. Progression therein continues to reward me with deployable objects  restorative campfires, vending machines for impromptu repairs, and a portable crafting table when trade items are needed in a pinch. Yet each path feels distinctly different, and Ill admit jealousy when I see a Soldier, Scientist, or Explorer engaged in their own unique path activities.', 'WildStars depth of customization is arguably its greatest asset. Player housing in particular brilliantly combines open construction and aesthetic freedom with tangible benefits. Every players house grants them an array of daily buffs, seemingly endless variations of decor items to decorate the interior and grounds, and six open allotments on which pre-assembled structures can be placed. I find myself constantly tinkering with each aspect for not only the real benefits they provide in the form of harvestable resources, challenges, achievements, and portals to the distant zones on Nexus, but as a welcome creative escape. In the same vein, WildStars gratifying costume system allows you to cosmetically apply and dye the appearance of any piece of equipment in your inventory without having to remove your statistically superior gear.', 'This Is Not the End', 'Carbine Studios has always been adamant that WildStar would cater to hardcore players with its post-cap group content, most notably with the decision to include raiding in both the 20 and 40-man varieties  a trend MMOs have largely recoiled from due to their exclusive nature. And though Ive yet to unlock these large scale group challenges even after all this time playing, the effort required just getting to that point is indicative of Carbines delivery on that promise. Ive touched before on the satisfying difficulty in WildStars group dungeons and Adventures (similar to dungeons but with multiple choice-based branches), and I can confidently say that post level cap, those instances become some of the most consistently challenging engagements youll find anywhere.', 'Rewards therein function a little differently from your traditional gear structure as loot quality is tied to group performance: gold, silver, and bronze medals, respectively. On veteran difficulties, meeting the criteria for gold (and often even silver) can seem impossible at times due to strict requirements that demand near flawlessness. This perfection frequently results in party members immediately dropping from group at first stumble when a gold medal is no longer obtainable  which is uninviting and oppressive for new players trying to learn engagements for the first time. The attunement process for raiding actually requires most of this challenging content to be completed with medal, in addition to slaying world bosses, grinding reputation, and collecting endgame currency through daily quests.', 'Attunement is a daunting list that simply cant be completed alone, and so finding a dedicated guild becomes a priority. Guilds play a large part in the endgame thanks to both the challenge of the instanced content and Warplots, which function as purchasable guild-versus-guild PvP death arenas that can be equipped with all manner of weapons, monsters, and boosts. Less than a month out from launch, few guilds have the resources to really invest in the Warplot system, and Ive personally yet to find a guild that would allow me to tag along, but Im incredibly intrigued by the possibilities knowing firsthand the level of customization Carbine Studios is capable of.', 'That said, Im less invested in the current state of PvP in WildStar, primarily the two battlegrounds, which both struck me as chaotic, imprecise experiences. I chalk this up mostly to the telegraph system, which I love in PvE, but feel doesnt translate well into the mass-scale clashes between 20 players fighting over a single objective. As a mobile ranged damage dealer Im less affected than, say, a warrior would be, but when a constant rotation of a dozen attacks congeal into a spastic red sea that players must wade through to touch each other, theres little strategy at play. Hopefully the knowledgebase evolves and engagements become more calculated with time, which is more the case in WildStars arenas.', 'Like every MMORPG, the success or failure of WildStar will ultimately land on the shoulders of its endgame. WildStars wealth of existing post-cap content is both rewardingly, brutally hard, and varied enough that theres something for everyone. With the next patch already introducing further endgame content, I believe WildStar has the legs to go the distance, and is absolutely worth the monthly subscription fee. To that regard, the much-touted C.R.E.D.D. system that allows players to buy/sell month-long chunks of playtime for in-game resources. Though the economy is still young and the price of C.R.E.D.D. will undoubtedly inflate, at the time of this writing, players can grind enough in-game currency to purchase a C.R.E.D.D. inside of a week: Its wholly possible to play to pay.']",IGN

Many others cross those lines unknowingly, out of ignorance rather than malice. But Blue Estate vaults over these lines knowingly, willfully, and for seemingly no reason but to wallow in adolescent squalor. Its many failed attempts at humor make its bog-standard rail-shooter gameplay all the more unbearable, but the worst part is how gleefully self-assured it is in its outdated notions of writing and design.', 'You only need to play Blue Estate for a minute or two to know everything there is to know about its 3ish hour-long play time. Its an old-school arcade rail-shooter, one that doesnt add any interesting new twists to hide the fact that all youre doing is pointing at something and pressing a button to make it die over and over.', 'Perhaps you could say the same for much of the genre, but the best ones - like House of the Dead and Time Crisis - inject tension and fun into the formula with a frantic pace, over-the-top set-pieces, and crazy boss battles. Blue Estate never makes even a half-hearted attempt at any such variety. Stages drag on for what seems like forever, waves of generic, slow-moving goons line up to catch bullets for you, and the few weapon pickups do little to spice things up either. The Dual Shock 4s motion controls are surprisingly well-suited for handling the action, but when the action is so droning and uninspired, the controls hardly matter.', 'There arent many things a game can be that Id consider worse than boring, but artlessly offensive is one of them. From the title screen on, Blue Estates treatment of gender and race are a constant distraction.', 'There is no grey area here. Protagonist Tony Luciano literally refers to his girlfriend as a thing that belongs to him. Blue Estate commits so completely to treating women like objects, and casting people of any race into the worst possible stereotypes that youd think it was going for satire. But by the end of the first two levels, I had given up on waiting for some sort of message. There isnt one. It really is just a long string of unfunny, poorly-written jokes made at the expense of others. That Blue Estate only ever grabs at the lowest of low-hanging fruit is completely infuriating on its own, but the fact that its also completely unfunny just adds insult to injury.']",IGN

While it leaves a hint of ambiguity to keep some mystery in the world of Fabletown, Cry Wolf ties a ribbon around the entire series in expert fashion. It pays special attention to rewarding those of us whove kept note of minor details, characters, and events since Episode 1 last year. It embraces the series many storytelling genres, and left me going over specific scenes and actions in my head long into the night.', ""This episode begins with a bang, with Bigby surrounded by the Crooked Man and his nightmarish posse. Cry Wolf is drenched in action, but instead of just titillating, the violence is there to allow us and Bigby to come to terms with our decisions from throughout the whole season. As I picked who to attack first in that initial brawl, or to focus on during an exhilarating car chase, I could feel the weight of every tense character relationship and tough decision I'd made since Episode 1 behind me. It all built smoothly up to this."", ""The combination of frantic Quick Time Events and branching dialogue trees with legitimate consequences make the actual act of playing Wolf Among Us a more active experience than a simple choose-your-own adventure story. Cry Wolf also does an excellent job of letting us paint Bigby Wolf in whatever shade of gray we choose. Whether hes the righteous sheriff, fairytale monster, or something in between, Telltale empowers us to make this Bigby our Bigby, and by extension, this story is our story in a way that most adventure games can't manage."", 'Most of the side characters, good, bad, and glamoured, get just enough time in Cry Wolf for a satisfying conclusion. Georgie, the Crooked Man, and Nerissa specifically get a welcome dose of added dimension. The only disappointment on this front comes from Snow White, or the lack thereof. Seeing as how shes been a major character and plot point since the beginning, having her relegated to a single, albeit meaty scene left me feeling a bit disappointed.', 'Episode 5 manages to cram many different storytelling genres into its 90-minute duration, but each of them gets enough breathing room to feel like Telltale had an important reason to include it. The horror of finally facing off against Bloody Mary, the magic of watching Bigby fall back on his fairytale roots, the drama of having your choices judged by the citizens of Fabletown, and the overall air of noir thats hovered over the series since its opening credits all jive together wonderfully.', 'This final episode, especially the final scene, leaves a much-appreciated ambiguity over the entire series. Its tough to talk about while remaining vague, but lets just say that many of Wolfs noir influences have never been more apparent. Unlike the Season 1 finale of The Walking Dead, Wolf leaves a lot of smart, intriguing questions on the table, and its up to perceptive players to fill in the gap.', 'And unlike the wheel-spinning of Episode 4, every scene in the finale feels necessary, personal, and ultimately rewarding. When I finally made one of the series most agonizing decisions, seeing the reactions of my fellow Fables brought me back to those powerful waning moments at the end of The Walking Dead.', ""Your actions can lead to a handful of very different endings, in both what's on the screen, as well as how you interpret those events. The central events remain unchanged, but characters can live or die, and mysteries can remain opened or closed depending on what kind of a character you want to be.

266,Shovel Knight,25-Jun-14,Colin Moriarty,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/25/shovel-knight-review,"[""The gaming industry is attached to an invisible pendulum. In recent years, that pendulum has noticeably swung towards an appreciation of the old school, with pixel art, grueling difficulty, and seemingly ancient ideas made new again. Yacht Club's Shovel Knight is one such product of the pendulum swing, though it doesn't fall into the trap all too common with likeminded games. It isn't just some throwaway cash-in or half-baked concept designed to take advantage of the zeitgeist. It doesn't just look the part. It expertly plays the part, making it perhaps the best retro-inspired game since Mega Man 9 and 10."", ""Shovel Knight is a clever, well-made, and thoughtful amalgamation of a cascade of NES classics. Its gameplay, bosses, and level designs are inspired by Mega Man. Its charming world map, with its roving parts, limited non-linearity, and inconveniently sealed-off segments will be recognizable to anyone who has played Mario 3. Its combat contains a significant dash of Duck Tales. Its hub towns, inventory and money systems -- as well as its cast of NPCs to interact with -- represent a hybrid between Zelda II and Faxanadu, while its sub-weapon system is an ode to Castlevania and Ninja Gaiden. The real beauty of Shovel Knight isn't that it's a clearly worded love letter to the storied NES era; it's that it drew inspiration from nothing but great NES games."", ""Then again, what makes Shovel Knight truly stand out is that while its lineage is clear, it's still its own game with its own distinct personality, art style, soundtrack, and plot. It isn't a flagrant rip-off. It doesn't retread identical paths already worn-in by what inspired it. It's merely informed by what made those old classics tick, with a willingness to take and use what worked. It's powered by a love of what was, yet it isn't just another Mega Man, Mario, or Castlevania. It's Shovel Knight through and through, a product of hindsight and 25 years of distance between itself and the era it actually belongs in."", ""At the start of the adventure, we're introduced to Shovel Knight's rudimentary story, one revolving around our brave protagonist and his partner, the complementary Shield Knight. After some unfortunate events, Shovel Knight and Shield Knight are separated as an evil sorcerer known only as the Enchantress takes over the kingdom they're sworn to protect. Helping the Enchantress is her so-called Order of No Quarter, a group of eight devious knights that would easily fit in among Mega Man's roster of Robot Masters, each with his own themed stage and arsenal of attacks. Like those aforementioned Robot Masters, the Order of No Quarter is rife with amazing designs. I was especially partial to Tinker Knight, Treasure Knight, and Propeller Knight, but in reality, I loved all eight designs, from King Knight and Specter Knight to Plague Knight and Mole Knight."", ""After a brief intro stage that teaches players Shovel Knight's simplistic control scheme -- move, jump, and attack -- we're thrust onto a map that's cut from the same cloth as Mario 3's eight worlds. The kingdom has been seized by the Enchantress and her men, and slowly but surely, Shovel Knight must defeat her eight protectors as he moves through stage after stage. Better yet, the adventure is occasionally interrupted as ever-moving enemies cross paths with you on the map itself, just like the Hammer and Boomerang Bros. would 25 years ago. Its straight-forwardness is, like everything else in the game, a product of its many inspirations. It's accessible and simple to understand, especially for those of us who grew up with an NES controller fused to our hands."", ""Gameplay in Shovel Knight is fluid and responsive. It's not quite as tight as Mega Man, but it's also not as nuanced and heavy as Castlevania or as twitchy and fast as Ninja Gaiden. Armed with a shovel -- as his name suggests -- Shovel Knight can bash enemies with a quick slash, or he can jump on top of them with a pogo-like attack ripped straight out of the timeless Capcom classic Duck Tales. Better yet, Shovel Knight's implement isn't only used as a weapon, but also as a tool. He can dig up treasures with it, eliminate blocks of sand, rock, and other minerals to clear paths, and, once you earn enough loot, you can even purchase useful upgrades for it that make it more powerful. One extra useful attack allows Shovel Knight to shoot a pulse of energy across the screen, but only if his health is full, Zelda-style."", ""Speaking of loot, earning cash and spending it is an important component of Shovel Knight. Virtually every enemy you encounter and hidden cavern you explore is chock-full of valuables, and you can use them to purchase essential weapon, armor, health, and mana upgrades. And then there are the sub-weapons that are found in hidden nooks throughout the game, such as a wand that shoots fire. My favorite subweapons, however, were ones directly inspired by Castlevania, like an anchor that's thrown in an arc, similar to the Axe used in Simon and Trevor Belmont's adventures."", ""You may need those upgrades and sub-weapons for the adventure's more difficult sections, but Shovel Knight brings a balanced difficulty that's somewhat challenging, yet never insurmountable. It provided me about as much challenge as Mega Man 2 did (the easiest Mega Man game by a mile), and it never feels overly punitive. Part of me is actually disappointed by this, as I adore a good old-school platformer challenge, but I also understand the approach, especially to attract younger or less experienced gamers that didn't grow up during such punishing times."", ""You can actively make it a little tougher, though, because you can actually destroy checkpoints to earn a ton of loot. It's a clever risk-reward system that replaces lives and continues, though it can easily backfire on you if you aren't careful. Worse yet, each time you die you lose money, and you can only earn it back by retrieving it where you perished. Shovel Knight has found its own way to reward people who play carefully and deliberately while punishing those who rush and are careless, even if it's not even remotely as archaic and ruthless as, say, Castlevania III."", ""Stages introduce new components in the same way old games did; with a wink and a nod, one chance to get it right with no hazards around you, and no tutorial. Then, you're thrown into the fire. I found some of the stages to be a bit devoid of an enemy presence at times -- I would have preferred more foes to fight more often -- but Shovel Knight instead opts for a DuckTales-inspired slant, with fewer enemies and more platforming feats to overcome. The non-boss enemies that do appear run the gamut from cute and well-designed to weak and uninspired; indeed, my biggest disappointment came from a lack of diversity between some enemies and a propensity to palette swap too often, especially with two enemies in particular -- a knight and a wizard -- both of whom you will encounter with regularity. But the Order of No Quarter and brilliant cast of NPCs more than make up for these minor design deficiencies."", ""And even with some disappointing enemies, the stages themselves are diverse and brilliantly designed, and always accompanied by fresh, retro-themed chiptunes. There were so many stop-and-look (and stop-and-listen) moments that it would be hard to recount them all, but I always loved how Shovel Knight's parallax scrolling introduced and then hid awesome background imagery, especially the Enchantress' castle, which seems to always be sitting ominously in the background. From an underwater stage that recalls Bubble Man's level in Mega Man 2 to a factory inspired by Metal Man's level from the same game, there's a lot to marvel at, both in the foreground and background, from brilliantly-colored northern lights-filled skies and lush forests to eerie, abandoned graveyards and dark, dingy dungeons. Aesthetically, Shovel Knight is perpetually easy on the eyes and ears."", '', '', 'PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation Vita Versions\n', 'The PlayStation versions of Shovel Knight build upon the same incredible gameplay, challenge, and style that earned its place as one of our favorite games of 2014, and add even more to love. The presence of God of Wars Kratos as a hidden boss is a fantastic addition. Battling him is tense, and earning his Armor of Chaos adds a neat twist to Shovel Knights traversal and combat, and make playing through the adventure actually feel fresh again.', 'The Cross-Buy and Cross-Save nature of Shovel Knight on Sony platforms makes it quick and easy to hop between your PS3, PS4, and PlayStation Vita, all of which provide great homes for the 8-bit visuals and audio.']",IGN

Its stellar gameplay and the hard-to-escape addiction keeps it on top (though its insane graphics and effects don't exactly hurt), but for some, it's started to run its course since its launch alongside PlayStation 4 in November of 2013. To inject some freshness into its twin-stick, Defender-inspired shooter, developer Housemarque didn't only launch a free patch that adds some new goodies; it's also given the world Resogun's very first DLC pack, called Heroes,  that gashes open the barely healed wound of addiction."", ""Heroes comes packing two new modes. Survival modes twist isn't well-hidden by its name, giving you one life to live in Resoguns brutal gameplay. Instead of roving from stage to stage, you're instead placed in the same cylindrical world (a location called Avernus) as day-night cycles circulate in the background, marking the passage of time. The longer you survive, the more points you gain. Unlike the core experience, your multiplier is never in danger of being reset, and humans don't have to be saved. But you'll want to save them, because rescuing them in sequence gives you upgraded weapons, shields, bombs, and more, which will help you survive. They'll parachute in from the sky, spawn out of defeated enemies, and more."", '', 'Protect yourself. You only have one life to live!', 'The brutality and unhinged chaos of Survival Mode is what makes it so appealing. There is simply no room for error, especially if you\'re darting about without a shield. When you die, you die. Your score is your score, and there\'s nothing more you can do about it, other than playing again and trying to beat it. It gets really hard really rapidly, and is best played by veterans of Resogun\'s main campaign. New, wily enemies make it even trickier, giving experienced players new things to learn while retaining that ""just one more game"" hook that makes Resogun the hyper-addictive game that it is.', ""Housemarque understands from its days crafting Super Stardust HD, Dead Nation, and Super Stardust Delta that competing with your friends on the leaderboards is half of the fun, which is why navigating those leaderboards after each game, switching between global and friends views, is easy, fast, and quick to update. One second, you can be in Survival Mode, the next, you can be dead. Seconds later, you can be in the leaderboards, and seconds after that, you can be back in-game, with the score you want to beat on your mind. You can bounce around with ease, with few loads and little standing in your way. Then again, if you don't want to go to the leaderboards, there are little reminders littered throughout the experience about how you've done in the past, as well as how your friends stack up."", ""I was less fond of Heroes' other mode, Demolition, though I like and appreciate how different it is from anything else in Resogun. Here, the rules completely change. In short, your ship can no longer shoot. Instead, it can pulse energy every so often, energy that can be used to push around unbreakable balls that shatter enemies and obstacles in their wake. You can also pulse to kill enemies in your direct vicinity. Just watch your back: those balls you're shooting around the cylinder can easily come from behind you and knock you into oblivion. This mode is difficult and rewarding; I just wasn't all that crazy about how much of Resoguns captivating pacing and quickness it sacrifices to get Demolitions thoughtfulness and strategy."", '', 'I came in like a wrecking baaaallllllll.', ""As an aside, everyone who owns Resogun -- even if they choose not to buy the Heroes DLC -- has already received a free patch that has reset the leaderboards (which is sad), but also added a full ship creator. Crafting your own ship -- not only aesthetically, but in terms of its strengths and weaknesses -- is a blast, and better yet, you can share your creations online, find and rate other people's crafts, and use any ship created as your own. As my love of Mega Man 3 goes deep, I replicated the head of Magnet Man in Resogun, so naturally, you can make just about anything you want. I was especially impressed by some of the Star Wars creations floating around: TIE Fighters, X-Wings, and the like.""]",IGN

That product was a brand-new PlayStation 4 game -- Entwined -- and unfortunately, the way it was randomly announced and released is probably the most remarkable thing about it.', ""Entwined is beautiful -- arrestingly so -- but unfortunately, it's also a game constructed around a contradiction. For as much as I appreciate its thoughtful approach and Thatgamecompany-like attempt at atmospheric storytelling, the fact remains that its pensive nature and understated trying-to-tell-you-something plot is obscured by its occasionally frustrating gameplay. It was hard for me to take its wonderful aesthetic in when I was left inevitably annoyed by the end of every stage, taking me out of the heady experience in the process."", ""At the core of Entwined is a simple and easy-to-understand gameplay morsel most reminiscent of the cult-hit PS3 game Dyad. A majority of the experience takes place in a series of endless tunnels, and within these tunnels rest a litany of orbs and obstacles colored blue and orange. Using DualShock 4's dual analog sticks, you take control of two dueling creatures -- a fish and a bird -- that each occupy their own 180 degree portion of the tunnel. Blue orbs should be collected by the blue creature, orange orbs by the orange creature, and occasionally, a green block means both animals should collide with it simultaneously. Entwined is, in premise, easy to pick up, play, and understand, even with very little in the way of typical text-laden tutorials. Its accessibility is one of its strengths."", ""Regrettably, for as easy as it is to understand, its finicky controls can quickly lead to frustration. Each of the campaign's nine chapters require the collection of those aforementioned orbs to build up the dragons' respective meters to maximum, all the while colliding with successive like-colored barriers to sustain the meters' growth. Miss a barrier, and the like-colored meter takes a hit. Things are easy going in general until the end of each level, when a requirement to fuse the two dragons together by holding L1 and R1 rears its ugly head. Make a short series of mistakes, and the dragons become separated, requiring a new fusion attempt. It's easy to get caught in this cycle for minutes at a time, especially as sequences become more complicated, and the longer I was caught, the more removed from the ethereal nature of Entwined I became. It's truly a shame when a game this pretty and atmospheric makes you want to bang your hand on the table in frustration."", ""This comes back to the flaw at the heart of Entwined: it's trying, at least in premise, to be the kind of art house game the PlayStation ecosystem has been so well-known for, joining the likes of Flower, Journey, and The Unfinished Swan. But its literal interpretation of what a game actually is removes greatly from its narrative power, especially because -- unlike Thatgamecompany's classics -- you're constantly reminded that you're playing a game, rather than being immersed in a unique experience. Entwined's Achilles' heel, for as well-intentioned as the entire project is, comes back to that simple point: if the adventure only lasts 90 minutes like Entwined (or like Journey before it), shouldn't it be a truly special 90 minutes? Or should it be littered with both promise as well as little annoyances?"", '\n\n', '', ""With only an hour and a half of gameplay in its Story mode, Entwined also comes packing a Challenge mode you can mess around with if you want, but otherwise, it's fairly barren of content, even at its affordable price. It's hard to take issue with its lush color palette, beautiful soundtrack, and overall atmosphere. I just wish that if Entwined insisted on reminding you that you're playing a game, that it did it with more subtlety and nuance, and less frustration.""]",IGN
269,EA Sports UFC,19-Jun-14,Vince Ingenito,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/19/ea-sports-ufc-review,"['Tension, and danger  these two elements are what make mixed martial arts thrilling to me, and sadly, these are the two things that EA Sports UFC just cannot conjure up. EA has certainly put on a good show, and laid a sound foundation upon which to build the next UFC game, but several errant balance and design decisions regarding both striking and grappling knock the teeth out of what should feel like a high-stakes game of inches.', 'UFC was built exclusively for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and it shows. These are some of the most impressive character models and animations Ive ever seen in a game. Even up close and in motion, they appear natural and believable. Especially during pre-match introductions, these virtual fighters convincingly exude the personalities of their real-life counterparts. Georges St-Pierre conducts himself with measured discipline, and The Axe Murderer creepily rolls his hands while maintaining an icy cold stare. Combined with the spot-on TV-style presentation and energetic commentary, these touches help successfully bottle the tone and energy of a big UFC pay-per-view event.', 'Even when fists start flying, good transitional animations and hit reactions keep things looking fluid and organic, though its disappointing that most of the grappling animations are the same from character to character. That doesnt keep the sheer detail of the animations from impressing though. Skin ripples with impact, fighters visibly wince in pain with every crushing leg kick, and hands flail for leverage when the fight heads to the ground. These are flesh and blood warriors, not a pack of uncanny-looking puppets.', 'Mixed Martial Arts is an extraordinarily complex sport, and Im pleased that EA tried not to dumb it down at all. There are a ton of options for attack, defense, stand-up, and mat-work, but its more than the control scheme can readily handle. Be prepared to hold multiple shoulder buttons while fiddling with the analog sticks and face buttons  all simultaneously. I got used to it, but this isnt a game most people should expect to pick up and play quickly.', 'Where UFC really gets into the weeds is with its overall balance. Having watched a good share of mixed martial arts, its off-putting and deflating to see how the whole cast shrugs off shots that would fell even the stiffest-chinned fighters in the world. If Anderson Silva is whipping you around in a thai clinch, landing repeated knee-bombs to your face, that should be a wrap no matter who you are.', 'The same goes for submission battles. The system behind these grappling chess matches is actually pretty fun, and its cool how it takes fighters stats and stamina into consideration. But every sub attempt becomes a minute-long, multi-staged duel no matter what. In fairness, this can happen in a real UFC fight, but just as often, great jiu-jitsu practitioners will find an opening and slap a quick hold on for a decisive tap-out. Its unpredictable and dangerous to attempt.', 'The fact that you can absorb a seemingly endless amount of punishment, and have forever to wiggle free of submission attempts made me feel safe no matter the situation...and safe is the opposite of how I want to feel in an MMA game. I want to think twice before throwing a punch when The Spider starts bobbing and weaving. I want to tremble in fear when BJ Penn starts smothering me with his rubber guard to set up a gogoplata.', 'The same lack of stakes permeates the entire grappling game too. Sweeping and passing is just too easy, since you will always succeed unless your opponent does the correct counter. That might sound fair on paper, but in practice it takes all the urgency out of the ground game. Im never more than a single click of the analog stick away from getting back to my feet if my opponent misses their counter window, which makes fighting for a dominant position more or less meaningless.', '', 'Is this real life?', 'Outside of the ring, UFC has little of value to offer. Theres a series of challenges that teach you things that probably should have been in the tutorial you get wrangled into on first boot up. Online play is functional, but the career mode is more or less an endlessly repeating cycle of boring, repetitive menus, and cheesy atta boy! FMVs. Customizing and progressing my fighter would have been a lot more fun if I didnt have to wade through so much tedium to do so.']",IGN

But Valiant Hearts is one of only a few to look at the first World War. Its a studied depiction, but one in which you rarely shoot a gun. Its a puzzle adventure thats much more interested in how people are affected by such terrible events than recreating the violence. It occasionally gets too bogged down with historical trivia, but overall its a stylish and sincere adventure with a big heart.', 'The most striking aspect of Valiant Hearts is the splendid art direction. Playing it really feels like watching a wonderful piece of animation, and I was surprised at just how versatile the style is. Of course, it shines at beginning when asked to depict the calm of rural France, but its equally effective when tackling much more difficult environments. The trenches and frontlines of the war, in particular, resemble scenes from Hell, with thick smoke weighing down from above and piles of corpses providing cover. Importantly, the cartoon style never conceals the horror of what is taking place.\n', 'Similarly, the characters have much more depth than their flat appearance initially suggests. Set along the border of France and Germany, the story tells the interlocking tales of five protagonists all touched by the war. You spend time with each one, and while the storytellings strong enough, its the animation which brilliantly reveals so much about each one. Barrel-chested Freddie struts into battle with the conviction of a man out for revenge, while Emile has a downtrodden gait that betrays a weariness that cant be overlooked. While there are snatches of dialogue, a lot is also conveyed through the inarticulate yet strangely intelligible sounds made by these squat figures.', 'The bold art style succeeds because of some deft touches, so its a shame that the narrator has no qualms with laying it on a bit thick. Nowhere is this more pronounced than at the end, which is predictably moving, though spoiled somewhat by the narrator underscoring what I already felt unprompted.', '\n', 'Unexpectedly, theres also a sense of humor to be found. This works brilliantly on occasion, like when Ana flees Paris to the strains of the can-can. But elsewhere, its less well-judged. One of the points the story goes to great lengths to emphasize is the universal horror of war and how it affected people of all nationalities; one of the characters you play is a German soldier, even. So to have a bratwurst-chomping, pretzel-loving villain as the only identifiable antagonist seems at odds with the rest of the experience. Hes definitely more caricature than character.', 'When it comes to gameplay, Valiant Hearts is an adventure full of puzzles which arent all that difficult to solve. Its clear the experience is being pitched everyone, rather than those who need a challenge. This never bothered me in the slightest  the puzzles are satisfying enough to work through, and I actually think getting stumped would have undercut my interest in the plot.', 'And theres plenty of variety in what youre given to do. Some puzzles involve simple object gathering, while others require strategic costume changes. Youll lend your hand to plumbing, trench digging, and safe cracking. And its all in service of the plot, whether its reuniting loved ones or venturing behind enemy lines, the puzzles drive you forward. There are also more action-led sequences dotted throughout  again, theyre not particularly demanding, but do create some of standout moments. A particular highlight of mine was escaping from a POW camp by moonlight, evading torchlight and hiding behind scarecrows, bushes, and even a herd of wandering sheep.', 'Throughout its six or so hour running time, Valiant Hearts does a magnificent job of incorporating so many aspects of the First World War. Each chapter introduces more iconic elements: zeppelins, flamethrowers, tanks, barbed wire, mustard gas, and even things like military insurrection. Everything finds a place. But whats really great is they arent just chucked in  theyre always used in a way that makes sense: as a mechanic to learn, an obstacle to overcome, or even the basis for a new type of puzzle.', 'Less successful is the way in which it flaunts historical credentials alongside the fiction its trying to unfold. Youre constantly bombarded with historical fact boxes. Reading them is entirely optional, but I found the prompt too insistent and a bit irritating. It totally clashes with the sense of style created by the art. Valiant Hearts does a great job of presenting such information through the world itself. It doesnt need Encarta 95-style footnotes.', '', ""Such crude trivia dumps are at odds with the game's presentation."", 'It also creates some unnecessary tension between fact and fiction. Right at the beginning, were told these stories are freely adapted, and sometimes its more of a game than historical re-enactment, and Im completely fine with that. For instance, theres a section in which you attack a zeppelin with the help of a busted church organ in Reims cathedral. Im pretty sure that didnt happen... yet it works, providing a fun, memorable encounter that doesnt undermine the subject matter. The slight awkwardness comes when the grim historical reality is presented immediately after one of these more fanciful interludes.']",IGN

The beauty of this personality system is that you never quite know what to expect, and you cant force two parties to do anything. Instead, you play the role of a problem solver and facilitator for these charming little people, and thats a surprisingly funny and rewarding experience.', '\n', 'Those random events may sound strange, but they also highlight this games true purpose: Tomodachi Life is not concerned with the typical game structure like a lengthy campaign of completing objectives and to-do lists. Sure, Miis offer to play shallow minigames from time to time, but simple memory or guessing games didnt keep me entertained at all. Instead, a majority of its freeform gameplay lies in observation and responding to the random needs of Miis. At first glance, the touch-screen interface and world seem smaller and simpler than the multi-layered complexity of The Sims, but technical limitations cant restrain Tomodachi Lifes unique charm or its unabashedly humorous spirit.', 'Nintendo Miis sit at the center of Tomodachi Lifes friendly drama. Theyre both imported from friends via StreetPass and populated with the character creator. That tool empowers me to add whomever I want to my island, be it real-life friends, celebrities, or original creations, and each has one of several personalities and dozens of possible roles to play. My Miis make brief appearances as news anchors and shopkeepers, pop up at community events, and participate in fun musical performances. And they talk! Simple greetings like Heyo! or video sign offs like, Youre watching Mii News... make the world feel more vibrant and alive. The overall effect of Miis communicating with each other in real English language is welcome and endearing  even though they speak in flat, text-to-speech robotic voices, it adds an extra layer of context and dimension that Ive never absorbed from listening to Simlish.', 'More importantly, unexpected surprises play a major role in everyday Tomodachi Life. Once youve built up a small community of Miis, the individuals start to develop their own random needs based on their personalities. They seek out sweethearts and best friends, or randomly for new clothing items or skins for their apartments. I thoroughly enjoyed watching them become friends, enter relationships, and even argue with each other without being told to.', '\n', 'One day your goals could be as simple as providing an item to relieve a bad stomach ache using the touch-screen, but other days can feel slightly more involved, like offering a suitable location for a Mii to propose to his sweetheart. The pace is much lighter than Nintendos Animal Crossing series, and Tomodachi Life benefits from it. It felt at its best when I would randomly check in, see what problems I could solve, and move on. I never felt pressured to constantly find ways to make money, since plenty of cash gets handed out for solving Miis problems. The number of available shops for food, clothing, and other recreational activities expands as more islanders are introduced and more problems get solved -- a smart decision that encouraged me to build a community quickly.', 'Relationships play a special role in Tomodachi Life, but it should be noted that Nintendo takes a very conservative approach to romance in that Miis are only allowed to marry members of the opposite sex. For such a whimsical and adorable alternate world, its a shame Tomodachi Life doesnt present a more inclusive set of options that would better simulate the world we live in today.', 'Perhaps most importantly, Tomodachi Life never levels any penalties for putting your 3DS down for too long. The islanders patiently wait for interact and never reached the annoying passive-aggressive levels of Animal Crossings furry villagers.']",IGN

Three friends came blasting past me in their WWII fighters, soaring to my aid, all while shouting ""America!"" into chat, and billowing plumes of red, white, and blue smoke out the tails of their planes. This random act of patriotism made me smile wide (even as a Canadian myself), and as they tore apart my enemies it highlighted what the free-to-play War Thunder does best.', 'Youre given the choice to fly through the skies in classic aircraft or stick to land and drive hulking tanks across large battlefields, though I found the air-to-air combat much better paced and fun. To be clear, there is no interplay between the tank and plane combat. While flying youre bombing NPC tanks, so theres no opportunity to coordinate between ground and air forces  somewhat disappointing for a game that offers both. [Correction: there is a mode that allows both land and air combat on one map.]', 'Whether in the sky or on the ground, the 16v16 matches are filled with beautiful vehicle models that bring these classic machines to life. Creeping across the vibrant landscapes in a tank was great but my favorite moments would occur as I crested a mountain and rays of light would wash over my aircraft.', 'Game types range from Domination to Ground Attack, and each has multiple objectives for different roles to complete, so you arent stuck doing the same thing repeatedly. Often times I would fly my Boston Mk1 bomber during Domination maps to lay waste to NPCs on the ground with hefty 500lb bombs, while my allies in more agile fighter planes handled base capture. Proper team communication, like calling for allies to shoot a fighter off my tail, is essential for success  especially true when playing in one of the harder modes.', 'Most of my time was spent in the action-packed Arcade mode, where vehicle damage isnt as severe and you have unlimited ammo and multiple respawns. I found War Thunders flow and pacing to be at its best here, but two other modes exist for the more hardcore enthusiasts: Realism mode increases the difficulty by adding limited ammo and harsher damage penalties, while Simulation takes it to the extreme, where a single mistake can spell doom, and youre given no extra planes to respawn with.', ""Helping lift War Thunder even higher is the audio. The planes sound terrific as their engines rumble to life on the airstrip, and the the sound of gunfire is deep and satisfying as bullets rain from the skies and bombs crash into fortified emplacements. In fact, some of my favorite moments stem from times where I've been able to hear an approaching aircraft and pinpoint its location just by the sound as it buzzes from ear to ear."", ""Using the mouse to handle all the steering of your vehicle on PC goes a long way to help a newcomer learn how to fly or drive, and even after several hours of play I found myself still using this basic setup with only minor tweaks to the layout. War Thunder doesn't leave the hardcore hanging either, offering a plethora of options for flight sticks or other peripherals. The PlayStation 4 version uses these standardized controls, with a single stick handling all movement of your aircraft. I found the system was less effective on PS4 due to the lack of precision a mouse and keyboard offer. It wasnt until I dug into the menus and altered how the joysticks controlled my aircraft that I began to feel like I could fly with the same precision as the PC version, but it's doable."", 'Unfortunately War Thunder begins to drift off course once you leave the field of battle. Between missions you are thrust back into the cluttered menus, where little is ever done to explain them or the meaning that lies behind them. It took me a long time of exploring just to find out how to change my research options and upgrade my crew. This left me feeling like I had constantly been at a disadvantage in combat, due to my lack of knowledge on how to properly upgrade and outfit my aircraft.', 'The sparse in-battle HUD stands in harsh contrast to the overly abundant and cumbersome menus between them, and this absence of information made things more difficult. Upon death, almost no information is given to you to help explain why your enemy was able to knock you from the sky.', 'This lack of information even affects the currency, of which there are three types, but at no point was there ever a clear explanation of what each does. Spending them can even prove bothersome, and it isnt until the post-battle screen pops up that I even got any hints. The one plus side is that at no point did War Thunder make it feel necessary to purchase anything, as my time was rewarded with generous amounts of research and currency. For a free-to-play game, thats the most important thing behind actually being fun to play  and War Thunder generally gets both of those right.']",IGN

And forget about relying on past experience to get you through new obstacles, because each level is a uniquely shaped gem of absurd difficulty, each hidden trap has a distinct behavior, and some challenges can take hundreds of attempts to squeeze past successfully.', ""For all its toughness, however, 1001 Spikes' clever design  which forced me to continually re-think my approach while keeping victory tantalizingly just out of reach  always kept me going for just one more try. (Actually, dozens of tries.) In each level, I experienced three distinct phases: Immediate dread at the sight of corridors lined with rolling boulders, leaping scorpions, or spinning blades; death-filled experimentation as I found a path through them; and endless repetition of the same carefully timed leaps, high jumps, and knife throws so that I could repeat phases one and two while dealing with whatever fresh hell waited in the next part of the level."", 'Things that seemed impossible at first became routine and encoded into muscle memory after 10 or so deaths, and it rarely took very long to figure out what I needed to do. Nailing the timing and precision needed to actually do it was an uphill battle, of course, but part of what makes 1001 Spikes so addictive is that once a solution becomes clear, finishing the level becomes irresistible  and if you can pull it off, it\'s because you mastered that thing. You own it. And for me, the palpable sense of accomplishment and relief that came with actually completing a level was always enough to make me push ahead into the next one. As a helpful talking mouse at the beginning says, ""the harder the journey, the greater the joy of success.""', ""If you're especially frustrated with a given level, 1001 Spikes has a very non-old-school feature: you can elect to simply skip ahead to the next one. This may seem self-defeating, but the feature is clearly meant for beginners, with the catch being that skipping levels locks off the final stages of the Ukampa Temple  and, in turn, the entire second half of the campaign, during which the level-skip feature is disabled. Only by going back and repeating the unfinished levels can you hope to forge ahead; fortunately, you can freely revisit them from the world map."", 'There\'s more to 1001 Spikes than the 61 brilliantly grueling levels in its story mode  which, by the way, can be played in co-op with a friend. Its something that doesn\'t necessarily make them any easier, but does make them more fun. Collecting the gold skulls hidden in each level unlocks a host of bonuses, including new playable characters assembled from other indie games. Using them lets you take advantage of new abilities  Tempura of the Dead\'s President Thompson has a double-jump and a submachine gun, for example, while Aban\'s sister Tina can cling to walls  but they each have to start a separate campaign from the beginning, which limits their campaign usefulness to making repeat playthroughs more interesting.\nThey\'re great in the arcade modes, though, which let up to four (local-only) players compete to collect coins (which can buy even more extras from an unlockable shop). The first mode, a chaotic, Smash Bros.-style smack-\'em-up called The Golden Vase, lets players compete to beat coins out of the titular magic urn, is open from the start, and it\'s fun for a few minutes at a stretch. The unlockable modes  ""The Tower of Nannar"" and ""The Lost Levels""  are a bit more interesting, delivering mini-campaigns with new levels that are perfectly playable solo, but more enjoyable with friends along.', '', '', 'PlayStation 4 Version', ""The PS4 and Vita versions are sold on PSN as a package deal, meaning they're arguably the best deal if you have access to both platforms. The PS4 version is identical to the PC and Wii U versions, with a couple of exceptions: it plays sounds through the controllers speaker, and it includes a Nathan Drake-inspired Adventure Aban skin for the arcade modes, which lets him cling to ledges and shoot a pistol. The skin is unlocked from the start, alongside the clear homages to Castlevania's Simon Belmont and Ghosts 'n' Goblins' Sir Arthur found in other versions."", '', '\n', 'PlayStation Vita Version', ""The Vita version lacks any multiplayer features and cuts The Golden Vase mode entirely (slightly disappointing, as it's useful for farming lots of coins in a hurry, but understandable). What remains plays identically to the other versions, features the PS4s Adventure Aban skin, and looks vibrant on the handheld's screen."", '', '\n', 'Wii U Version', 'Not to be outdone by the PS4 version, the Wii U edition comes with its own custom arcade-mode skin for Aban: the Mario-inspired Mr. Video Game, which comes complete with appropriate music and a fireball attack.', '', '\n', '3DS version', ""The 3DS version is easily the weakest of the bunch; not only does it lack multiplayer and The Golden Vase, but the smaller screen makes it tougher to spot some of the deadlier features camouflaged throughout 1001 Spikes' levels (and for the record, I played on a 3DS XL). Turning on 3D is a little disorienting, and even when it's off, the animation gets visibly (and shockingly) choppy when levels scroll. It's otherwise the same as the other versions and includes the Mr. Video Game skin, but its not an ideal way to play."", '', '']",IGN
274,Shovel Knight,25-Jun-14,Colin Moriarty,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/25/shovel-knight-review,"[""The gaming industry is attached to an invisible pendulum. In recent years, that pendulum has noticeably swung towards an appreciation of the old school, with pixel art, grueling difficulty, and seemingly ancient ideas made new again. Yacht Club's Shovel Knight is one such product of the pendulum swing, though it doesn't fall into the trap all too common with likeminded games. It isn't just some throwaway cash-in or half-baked concept designed to take advantage of the zeitgeist. It doesn't just look the part. It expertly plays the part, making it perhaps the best retro-inspired game since Mega Man 9 and 10."", ""Shovel Knight is a clever, well-made, and thoughtful amalgamation of a cascade of NES classics. Its gameplay, bosses, and level designs are inspired by Mega Man. Its charming world map, with its roving parts, limited non-linearity, and inconveniently sealed-off segments will be recognizable to anyone who has played Mario 3. Its combat contains a significant dash of Duck Tales. Its hub towns, inventory and money systems -- as well as its cast of NPCs to interact with -- represent a hybrid between Zelda II and Faxanadu, while its sub-weapon system is an ode to Castlevania and Ninja Gaiden. The real beauty of Shovel Knight isn't that it's a clearly worded love letter to the storied NES era; it's that it drew inspiration from nothing but great NES games."", ""Then again, what makes Shovel Knight truly stand out is that while its lineage is clear, it's still its own game with its own distinct personality, art style, soundtrack, and plot. It isn't a flagrant rip-off. It doesn't retread identical paths already worn-in by what inspired it. It's merely informed by what made those old classics tick, with a willingness to take and use what worked. It's powered by a love of what was, yet it isn't just another Mega Man, Mario, or Castlevania. It's Shovel Knight through and through, a product of hindsight and 25 years of distance between itself and the era it actually belongs in."", ""At the start of the adventure, we're introduced to Shovel Knight's rudimentary story, one revolving around our brave protagonist and his partner, the complementary Shield Knight. After some unfortunate events, Shovel Knight and Shield Knight are separated as an evil sorcerer known only as the Enchantress takes over the kingdom they're sworn to protect. Helping the Enchantress is her so-called Order of No Quarter, a group of eight devious knights that would easily fit in among Mega Man's roster of Robot Masters, each with his own themed stage and arsenal of attacks. Like those aforementioned Robot Masters, the Order of No Quarter is rife with amazing designs. I was especially partial to Tinker Knight, Treasure Knight, and Propeller Knight, but in reality, I loved all eight designs, from King Knight and Specter Knight to Plague Knight and Mole Knight."", ""After a brief intro stage that teaches players Shovel Knight's simplistic control scheme -- move, jump, and attack -- we're thrust onto a map that's cut from the same cloth as Mario 3's eight worlds. The kingdom has been seized by the Enchantress and her men, and slowly but surely, Shovel Knight must defeat her eight protectors as he moves through stage after stage. Better yet, the adventure is occasionally interrupted as ever-moving enemies cross paths with you on the map itself, just like the Hammer and Boomerang Bros. would 25 years ago. Its straight-forwardness is, like everything else in the game, a product of its many inspirations. It's accessible and simple to understand, especially for those of us who grew up with an NES controller fused to our hands."", '', ""It's time to remove King Knight from the throne."", ""Gameplay in Shovel Knight is fluid and responsive. It's not quite as tight as Mega Man, but it's also not as nuanced and heavy as Castlevania or as twitchy and fast as Ninja Gaiden. Armed with a shovel -- as his name suggests -- Shovel Knight can bash enemies with a quick slash, or he can jump on top of them with a pogo-like attack ripped straight out of the timeless Capcom classic Duck Tales. Better yet, Shovel Knight's implement isn't only used as a weapon, but also as a tool. He can dig up treasures with it, eliminate blocks of sand, rock, and other minerals to clear paths, and, once you earn enough loot, you can even purchase useful upgrades for it that make it more powerful. One extra useful attack allows Shovel Knight to shoot a pulse of energy across the screen, but only if his health is full, Zelda-style."", ""Speaking of loot, earning cash and spending it is an important component of Shovel Knight. Virtually every enemy you encounter and hidden cavern you explore is chock-full of valuables, and you can use them to purchase essential weapon, armor, health, and mana upgrades. And then there are the sub-weapons that are found in hidden nooks throughout the game, such as a wand that shoots fire. My favorite subweapons, however, were ones directly inspired by Castlevania, like an anchor that's thrown in an arc, similar to the Axe used in Simon and Trevor Belmont's adventures."", ""You may need those upgrades and sub-weapons for the adventure's more difficult sections, but Shovel Knight brings a balanced difficulty that's somewhat challenging, yet never insurmountable. It provided me about as much challenge as Mega Man 2 did (the easiest Mega Man game by a mile), and it never feels overly punitive. Part of me is actually disappointed by this, as I adore a good old-school platformer challenge, but I also understand the approach, especially to attract younger or less experienced gamers that didn't grow up during such punishing times."", ""You can actively make it a little tougher, though, because you can actually destroy checkpoints to earn a ton of loot. It's a clever risk-reward system that replaces lives and continues, though it can easily backfire on you if you aren't careful. Worse yet, each time you die you lose money, and you can only earn it back by retrieving it where you perished. Shovel Knight has found its own way to reward people who play carefully and deliberately while punishing those who rush and are careless, even if it's not even remotely as archaic and ruthless as, say, Castlevania III."", '', ""He'll wake up when you pound him in the face with a shovel."", ""Stages introduce new components in the same way old games did; with a wink and a nod, one chance to get it right with no hazards around you, and no tutorial. Then, you're thrown into the fire. I found some of the stages to be a bit devoid of an enemy presence at times -- I would have preferred more foes to fight more often -- but Shovel Knight instead opts for a DuckTales-inspired slant, with fewer enemies and more platforming feats to overcome. The non-boss enemies that do appear run the gamut from cute and well-designed to weak and uninspired; indeed, my biggest disappointment came from a lack of diversity between some enemies and a propensity to palette swap too often, especially with two enemies in particular -- a knight and a wizard -- both of whom you will encounter with regularity. But the Order of No Quarter and brilliant cast of NPCs more than make up for these minor design deficiencies."", ""And even with some disappointing enemies, the stages themselves are diverse and brilliantly designed, and always accompanied by fresh, retro-themed chiptunes. There were so many stop-and-look (and stop-and-listen) moments that it would be hard to recount them all, but I always loved how Shovel Knight's parallax scrolling introduced and then hid awesome background imagery, especially the Enchantress' castle, which seems to always be sitting ominously in the background. From an underwater stage that recalls Bubble Man's level in Mega Man 2 to a factory inspired by Metal Man's level from the same game, there's a lot to marvel at, both in the foreground and background, from brilliantly-colored northern lights-filled skies and lush forests to eerie, abandoned graveyards and dark, dingy dungeons. Aesthetically, Shovel Knight is perpetually easy on the eyes and ears.""]",IGN
275,Enemy Front,17-Jun-14,Dave Rudden,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/17/enemy-front-review,"[""This may come as a surprise to some, but in war, you don't have to kill every one of the enemy's forces to win. Sometimes, the best way to complete your mission objective doesn't involve facing a threat head-on at all. Enemy Front attempts to build a game on this mindset, and at times it delivers a mix of run-and-gun action and stealth with open stages featuring multiple paths. More often than not, however, its technology is too far behind the times to support the premise, and it doesnt make for a good multiplayer mode either."", ""It would be a bit awkward for a heroic soldier to spend a majority of a game's campaign alone and in the shadows, so Enemy Front casts you as Robert Hawkins, an American journalist during World War II who starts out more dedicated to writing a great story than defeating the Nazis. A byproduct of Hawkins' independence from the chain of command is that when he does give military personnel a helping hand, his role often comes with interesting choices. Sometimes it's as small as picking between two firearms, while other times it will change the way you play through a level as you choose which side of an enemy stronghold to enter from, or whether to break through enemy lines or provide sniper support to someone else doing the run."", ""While the story is somewhat different than the typical shooter plot that centers around overpowered soldier or group, it's not done any favors by Enemy Front's minimal presentation. Between the drab designs, bland voice acting, and unexpressive character models, I sometimes forgot which of the handful of named characters I was supporting during a given mission. Hawkins encounters a few frequent allies during the campaign, but their interaction isn't all that memorable, save for nearly every character calling him newspaper man. Further hamstringing the campaign is that the musical score has two good songs; the only two songs. [Update: there are actually more than two songs, it just seemed like there were only two due to repetition.] As epic as it sounds, hearing the low-key theme while sneaking and the high-tempo alternative during shootouts grows old before the campaign's even halfway done."", ""Outside of a handful of scripted encounters over the course of the 16 stages, you can actually avoid a majority of the Axis opponents in Enemy Front. Sometimes it's via total stealth, as taking longer, less-populated routes, hiding behind objects, crouching while walking, and silently taking out isolated soldiers will keep you from attracting attention. If you're far enough from the action, you can use a sniper rifle to thin the enemy's ranks, with outside sounds like a base's regularly scheduled loudspeaker announcements or a nearby train horn masking your shots. If you want to take the enemy head-on, the odds aren't completely insurmountable; fast movement between cover and constant use of explosives (both projectile and via barrels strewn about the battlefield) keeps you alive."", ""Each of the combat options foisted upon you has its own issues due to Enemy Front's behind-the-times engine. Stealth is pretty crude, lacking the nuance of the likes of Metal Gear and Splinter Cell. Enemies often spot you through far too many obscuring elements, and the stealth kills you're advised to utilize take so long that you'll almost certainly be seen in the time it takes to conclude (especially when you can take out that same enemy with one melee strike or a shot from the overpowered silenced pistol). The shortcomings during sniping sections is particularly odd, as developer City Interactive also created the Sniper: Ghost Warrior series, which includes features not present in Enemy Front, like zooming options, night vision, and options to increase stability like briefly holding your breath or once again, and going prone."", ""Standard run-and-gun combat isn't all that fulfilling either; the enemy AI isn't smart enough to flank, or even leave a particular spot on the battlefield unless shot at or given far too much time next to an undercooked grenade. In fact, there were multiple occasions where the enemy's pathfinding put them headfirst against a wall or outside of the level's bounds."", ""However, there's a fourth option Enemy Front doesn't clue you into which also works well at many points: running like hell. Since you usually have multiple paths to your next checkpoint and don't have to clear the battlefield of enemies, taking advantage of the fact that enemies can't hit a moving target with much success will work out in your favor quite often, even on the highest difficulty. While you'll sometimes end up in a situation where you've amassed far too many enemies on your tail, the majority of the levels have odd choke points where something as simple as a small obstacle or a closed door will close off the small army chasing you and give you a fresh start in a new section. Apparently, the walkie-talkie coverage during WW2 was pretty awful, as word of a sprinting madman never travels between these sections. It's obvious the developer knew this trick works, as Hawkins can only sprint for so long before running out of breath, but not enough was done to discourage it when facing desperate odds."", ""The one discovery sadder than the first time you realize sprinting through a level could have saved you hours is seeing how much more effort City Interactive put into Enemy Front's campaign in than into its multiplayer options. All four of the maps are a bit too big for eight-on-eight-max Team Deathmatch skirmishes, though when it's every man for himself in Deathmatch, the size of the stages makes for interesting hide-and-seek sessions. The somewhat innovative third mode, Radio Transmission, adds a nice twist to common multiplayer modes like King of the Hill and Control Point; you'll have to take control of radios strewn around the map in order to send a message, but capturing two (or more) radios next to each other will boost the signal and fill your side's meter to the winning point even faster. However, between the barren online lobbies as well as the paltry map and mode count, what's available in Enemy Front's multiplayer probably won't keep you satisfied for long, and it doesn't seem likely to gain in popularity from here.""]",IGN
276,Mind Zero,16-Jun-14,Meghan Sullivan,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/16/mind-zero-review,"['Lets just get this out of the way: Mind Zero is a blatant knock-off of Shin Megami Tensei: Persona with a bit of Etrian Odyssey mixed in. Luckily for us, and developer MindDiv, those are both good games. Even though I uncovered few traces of originality in Mind Zeros depths, I still found an enjoyable dungeon crawler with engaging turn-based battle mechanics, lively voice acting, and interesting exploration.', 'Traversing Mind Zeros dark and creepy dungeons is fun, thanks to puzzle-rich levels and easy-to-navigate corridors. I liked that I never knew what was around the next corner, whether it be a warp point that would send me to a far-flung corner of a dungeon, or a tough monster standing between me and the nearest exit. Stumbling upon randomly placed treasure chests rewarded my trepidation with super-rare items, and I even approved of the upticking difficulty level in dungeon layouts, as it kept me consistently challenged for its 40 hours. I did start to get bored with the myriad sidequests that had me trudging back through the same dungeons over and over again (and long loading times between levels didnt help), but using warp points and a fast-forward button during random enemy encounters made getting through these a lot easier.', 'Speaking of enemy encounters, I really dig Mind Zeros battle mechanics. The way you call upon ghostly beings (called MINDs) to help you in battle and use magic cards to boost stats is clearly inspired by Persona, but in a rather liberating twist, you can freely choose which powers MINDs have by swapping magic cards in and out of a characters skill slots. You can also upgrade or enhance these cards with points acquired through combat. Deciding which cards to upgrade and equip became harder and harder as I progressed, as enemies became stronger and required different strategies to beat. For example, monsters have different elemental strengths and weaknesses. In order to defeat them, I needed to have the right types of spells equipped, otherwise my party would be wiped out in a hurry. Conversely, if I had spells that decimated these enemies in one turn, Id be given bonus points. It gave me incentive to think more strategically (beyond simply not dying, of course).', 'I wish I could be as enthusiastic about the plot as I am about the gameplay, but this is where Mind Zero almost lost me. The story doesnt get much deeper than knowing that a group of high school friends must then employ their special powers to stop a group of bad guys from using MINDs for evil purposes. Even with a couple of plot twists and a cliffhanger ending meant to garner interest in the eventual sequel, I just couldnt bring myself to care much about what was happening.', 'The fact that the protagonists arent very interesting certainly didnt help. They all have personal reasons to be involved in the story, but I never got to know them well enough to care. For example, the goofy Leo has been afflicted with a monstrous arm that will eventually take over his whole body if he doesnt find a way to void the contract between him and his MIND... but he was more interested in showing off the latest goofy gadget hed bought online than discussing it. This type of shallow writing causes other characters to be equally bland.', 'If there is one bright spot in all this, its the acting. Thanks to some nimble voice work by the English voice cast, I actually enjoyed sitting through the mountains of stilted dialogue that accompanied each story event. And if I ever felt like practicing my Japanese or wanted to hear Takehito Koyasus silky smooth voice, I could switch over to the Japanese audio whenever I booted up my save file. I also enjoyed the catchy soundtrack and pretty graphics, which did a lot to bolster up the sagging story and elevate Mind Zeros overall presentation.']",IGN
277,Grid Autosport,24-Jun-14,Luke Reilly,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/24/grid-autosport-review,"['Grid Autosport is the closest Codemasters has come to recapturing the mojo of the original Pro Race Driver games since my PlayStation 2 was still plugged in. In stark contrast to the street racing-focused Grid 2, the pendulum has swung back towards actual motorsport; purpose-built race cars once again make up a sizeable slab of Autosports vehicle roster, and Codemasters has stuffed it with more than twice as many genuine racing circuits as Grid 2 has. Autosport makes some odd missteps with its low-quality cabin view and its flawed endurance racing, and it lacks the customisation options that wouldve empowered us to re-craft cars from the real-world racing series this game mimics, but overall Autosport is Codemasters finally firing on all cylinders again.', 'Importantly, Autosport redresses concerns with Grid 2s handling model: that it was a one-size-fits-all model honed for easy powerslides. Autosport more closely matches the handling in the original Grid; it still straddles the line between simulation and arcade, but it does ask us to take things a little more seriously than Grid 2 ever did. Even with the driving aids off I found Autosport fairly forgiving, but measured acceleration, steady steering, and careful braking are still key if you want a spot on the podium.', '', 'The thin attempt at plot from Grid 2 is gone in Autosport; all that matters here is the racing.', 'The multi-disciplined approach that has defined the Grid series (and the Race Driver series before it) returns here. In Autosport, progression is divided across five categories you can play through as you desire: Touring, Endurance, Open Wheel, Tuner, and Street. You need to play them all eventually if you want to meet the minimum requirements to unlock the special Grid Grand Slam events (which string together a series of races from across all five types of racing), but outside of that how you progress through the races on offer is determined entirely by you.', 'As a touring car fan, I found myself exclusively racing tin-tops for many hours upon first booting up. It was at least two or three sessions before I even competed in my first Street race. Autosport doesnt care that Id unlocked all of its touring car events before Id even started scratching the surface of its Street events, nor will it care if you do the exact opposite.', 'The better you perform in each category the more offers youll receive from rival teams. Less bold teams have easily achievable success targets but modest XP rewards, and youll usually find youre not able to tune your car a great deal, if at all. Autosports prestige team, Ravenwest, demands top results but shells out plenty of XP and allows you to adjust a variety of tuning options at your own discretion.', '', 'Meanwhile in Australia...', 'The Touring category is where Autosport most resembles the typical Codemasters circuit racers of old. Autosport lacks the real-world championships of its Race Driver ancestors, but the aggressive doorhandle-to-doorhandle nature of touring car racing is extremely well-emulated. Real-life circuits are the focus here (there are 13, compared to Grid 2s five, and most feature several routes), and Codemasters has reinserted practice periods and qualifying rounds. The default length for the races errs on the short side, but theres an option to multiply race distances by up to five should you find yourself yearning for longer contests.', 'Open Wheel racing is not unlike Codemasters own F1 series, although its nowhere near as brutally unforgiving as the latter can be. Autosport may be Grid going back to its roots, but it still favours fun over unflinching accuracy.', 'The Tuner category is probably the weakest of the five. Drifting feels a bit more forgiving (and more fun) than it did in Grid 2 but the Time Trials here arent really that pulse-raising; they honestly just feel like a qualifying session for a race that never comes.', '', 'The AI makes mistakes, although sometimes they make the sames ones even after multiple race restarts.', 'Endurance is Autosports most confusing category. They look the part, but the default length of these races is just eight minutes. Its strange because tyre wear, which is only a factor in the Endurance category, is scaled to the length of the race. You can bring a little logic to the tyre wear issue by manually increasing the length of your endurance races but that only serves to highlight Autosports most egregious sin: no pit stops. Its a bizarre omission, and its one that quietly undermines a lot of what Autosport does right. Deciding whether pitting for fresh rubber during an enduro to salvage a race objective wouldve added an interesting layer of strategy; not being able to do so is nonsense, really.', 'It also makes some of what Codemasters does with its damage modelling a waste of energy. For instance, whats the point of programming in punctures when I know I cant change that tyre? If Im out of Flashbacks (or Ive deactivated them) am I really going to run the rest of the race on my rim? Nope. Im just going to quit and restart the event.', '', 'We had pit stops on PSone. Just saying.', 'The Street category is where the Autosport picks up from Grid 2, with production cars of various levels of potency (from hot hatches to hypercars) racing on tight, largely walled city courses characterised by cramped and unconventional kinks and 90-degree corners. The tracks here are mostly repeats from Grid 2, like Dubai and Paris and such, but theyre not as overused in Autosport because street racing doesnt dominate the gameplay as much as it does in Grid 2. Codemasters stingy course design philosophy  which relies on multiple routes through the same environment, with most of the routes sharing lengthy, overlapping segments with each other  is less of an issue in Autosport because its been bolstered with so many great real-world tracks.', '', 'Washington features various landmarks to race past, like The White House.', 'In a response to Grid 2 criticism, Codemasters has added not one, but two different cabin views to Autosport. The more closely-cropped one is somewhat passable but the traditional one is a fuzzy mess and lacks any working dials or mirrors. Its a disappointing smear, because Autosport is a good-looking game for the most part. I love the little details, like the flies buzzing around your helmet while parked on the grid at Jarama under the belting Spanish sun, or the bugs assaulting your headlights when waiting for the green light in a night race. The car models, at least externally, are entirely satisfactory and the tracks beam with colour. There are quite a few details that dont stand up to much inspection, however. Underneath damaged hoods engine detail is rudimentary at best, as are the crowds. I did like how the stands were almost empty during qualifying sessions but packed for races, though.', '', 'The blurry open wheeler steering wheels are the worst.', 'Things are mostly satisfactory in the audio stakes, with some nice ambient effects, but the exhaust notes couldve had more bark. Purpose-built race cars are more deafening.', 'Like Grid 2, multiplayer is virtually a separate game in Autosport. Unlike Grid 2, however, Autosports broader types of racing and greater variety of tracks means theres far more to keep us occupied. As opposed to the single-player, where you race for other teams in their cars, multiplayer in Autosport lets you build your own garage of cars. Your cars will be unique, with their own mileage, win/loss rate, XP level, and incident history. The visual customisation here is quite narrow, though, so dont expect to be able to create any real-world replicas.', 'The racing itself was smooth and seamless during my online session with a mostly well-behaved group of racers. It supports up to 12 humans, but AI drivers can fill the empty slots if you choose. Autosports AI is actually quite good; they seem more aware of your actions than I expected and theyre pretty authentic opponents.']",IGN

The spiky yellow blob you control can slither through the smallest cracks in one instant, and jump over huge distances and up walls the next, giving you more moves to master than the typical run-and-jump game.', ""Controlling the blob through early puzzles with joysticks instead of the Vita's touch controls is simple. Even as it quickly gets the abilities to repel or stick to magnetized objects and fly through the air in low-gravity sections, things never get too complicated. Rather, as you progress, it becomes a test of coordination: using the blob's different powers to solve puzzles and move around areas, dodging lasers or moving platforms around, often using them to punt the blob around as if it were a pinball. Silly personality shines through when the blob is slammed and smacked against the environment, and great moments come frequently as it scoots around, narrowly sprinting by spike traps and up through sections while trying to outrun death lasers."", '\n', ""My favorite aspect of blob gameplay is its ability to ingest random objects to grow into a monstrous ooze of doom. In the vein of Katamari Damacy, the blob can only pass through certain areas of each stage if it's large enough. As your blob rolls around, eating up everything from coins, cups, nails, peanuts, bullets, all the way to people and eventually planes and tanks, it grows in size, regaining some health and earning points for each object it slurps up. Even though you don't need to eat everything, I got a kick out of rolling up all the screaming people as they tried to run away from my amazing, humungous blob monster, and then watching them flailing around inside the blob once it ate them up."", ""Levels in each of the six varied worlds are designed with a 1950s-inspired look and are filled with references to indie games, like Drinkbox's own Guacamelee!, and other nods like Phil's Fish restaurant or a billboard ad for Awesomenuts, in the style of a certain 2D MOBA's logo."", ""The 24 levels are all pretty short, each only taking about five to 10 minutes to complete. Even though your blob only has a few abilities with which to get through each stage, the puzzles don't often rely on the same tricks twice. But with such a limited number of stages, the good ideas never get the chance to fully develop into puzzle mechanics that you have to work too hard to solve. There's a quirky surprise and something unexpectedly funny all the way through them to the very end, but a little more challenge or complexity would have been welcome and made Mutant Blobs feel a little less superficial."", ""Most puzzles are a mix of finding enough items to increase the size of your blob, and platforming across perils to do it. None are especially difficult to figure out, and the checkpoints are quite forgiving. Each level has two optional hidden blobs to find as well, adding a nice extra challenge and some replay value. With the addition of leaderboard support, there's even more reason to go back and find your blob buddies."", 'Aside from the main levels in each zone, there are top-down mini-stages that try to take advantage of the motion sensor in your controller on PS3, but thats kind of a disaster. In a few of them you guide your blob around like a marble on a Labyrinth-inspired board, trying not to fall in any holes. I found them particularly frustrating to control on PS3, taking a dozen or so tries to get through the levels on PS3 that I could beat on my first try on the 360, where you can just use the thumbsticks.', ""However, I liked the other type of mini-levels, where you've simply got to roll the blob into as many items as possible. These bonus stages weren't too punishing and I genuinely enjoyed finding all the items and growing my blob to freakish proportions."", ' ']",IGN
279,The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing II,30-May-14,Leif Johnson,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/30/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing-ii-review,"[""One of the most incredible things about The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing II is how many amusing pop culture references it manages to cram into an action RPG without quite overdoing it. Some are fairly subtle, such as the sight of encircled lambdas glowing on dungeon walls; others slap you across the face with their directness, as in the hunt for one Private Bryan. (What's so important about him, Van Helsing's ghost companion Lady Katarina asks. Does he have a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead?) The gags are unrelenting, but somehow this rarely detracts from the experience; in a game starring a broadsword-wielding professor from the Victorian era, the comedy enriches it."", ""Enriched is the key word here. Van Helsing II sees developer NeoCore correcting many of the defects of last year's Incredible Adventures, a scrappy but flawed game that was generally lost in the middle of what turned out to be an isometric action RPG renaissance of sorts (see Torchlight 2, Path of Exile, and Diablo 3: Reaper of Souls). The sequel maintains the best parts: Van Helsing still trots about the lovingly rendered cobblestones of the steampunk wonderland of Borgovia, accompanied by the buxom banshee Lady Katarina, and he's still preoccupied with killing baddies and picking their corpses for sweet loot. Even the original's nods to tower defense strategy remain in the form of missions that require you to defend Van Helsing and his spiffy hat from the forces of new chief baddie General Harker."", ""Most action RPGs pay minimal attention to story; Van Helsing II turns this convention on its head by delivering a tale that's worthy of attention despite its simplicity. It's at its best when it's communicated through the always-entertaining banter between Van Helsing and Lady Katarina, who flirt and bicker among steampunk cities and wooded mountain paths with all the charm of an old married couple. It's silly stuff, but the duo and their respective voice actors bring a dash of personality that's all too absent in this genre."", 'More often than not, their chatter centers on the trustworthiness of Prisoner Seven, a foreboding fellow who looks like a geist from World of Warcraft but brings Van Helsing word of enemy movements and fishes him out of rubble when he\'s down. Most of the plot spills over from the first Incredible Adventures, yes, but a succession of handy cutscenes ensure you\'re up to speed if you want to start here. More practically, you can import your character from the first game if you choose. Or, if you want power right after the gate, you can create a level 30 ""veteran"" character with several key skills already in place.', 'It\'s a smart move, not least because it lets you get a feel for the three classes and their melee and ranged incarnations before you commit to them. One of the great failings of the first game is its insistence that you limit yourself to the Van Helsing\'s archetypical ""hunter"" class; Van Helsing II remedies that by shipping with the magey Thaumaturge or the gadget-focused Arcane Mechanic. Even Katerina enjoys more utility now; in Van Helsing II, you can set her role and guide her skill progression more effectively. New skills and situational hotkeyed ""tricks"" complement the enjoyable two-ability combat, which lets you switch out weapon sets in a second and power up attacks by building resources and executing combos.', ""Truth be told, I wasn't enjoying myself much until I jumped in with one of the pre-made veteran characters. Currently the balance is all over the place, and you'll go from fighting against perfectly manageable swarms to fighting foes who kill you so fast that you don't even have time to see the screen flicker red. Even the veteran characters don't fare so well; their main advantage seems to lie in their superior starting gear rather than durability. Thankfully NeoCore lets you change the difficulty at any time you choose, but this presents its own complications in that Van Helsing II also extends it to the hardcore mode with its permanent deaths, which seems to defeat the purpose of having a hardcode mode at all."", ""Iron out the kinks in the balance, and Van Helsing II has all the elements of a respectable ARPG, and it employs a few other tricks to help distinguish it. For example, you have the option to send out special agents on timed missions for loot and experience, much like the combat companions in Star Wars: The Old Republic. Van Helsing can even grow his own pet chimera, which comes in handy as a summonable combat minion or yet another NPC to send off for gold or special potions. The tower defense elements again add some variety to the slaughter, as they bid our broad-brimmed hero to drop whatever he's doing and come back to fend off hordes attacking his lair with traps and related devices. It seems a shame that losing generates no real consequence, but it's likely a concession to action RPG players who want little to do with tower defense. (On some levels, I'm one of them). You don't even have to fight them; you can send off your minions to handle them if you choose."", ""A four-player cooperative mode and a PvP area round out the current features, but I found the former distressingly prone to crashes whenever another player showed up. (NeoCore's been rolling out fixes for more manageable issues on almost a daily basis.) Pity, since I suspect that being able to count on having another player on hand would have alleviated some of the imbalance issues listed above.""]",IGN
280,Transistor,20-May-14,Marty Sliva,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/20/transistor-review,"['Transistor is a wildly smart action-RPG that places all of its trust into your intelligence. Nothing from its cyberpunk story rife with mysteries, to its deep combat that encourages experimentation, is ever spelled out for you, which I personally loved. For its second game, developer Supergiant takes everything that felt right about Bastions world and storytelling, trims much of the fat, and adds depth to combat that turns each encounter in its six hours into a life-or-death puzzle.', 'Transistor maintains the same hand-drawn style as Bastion -- its heavily influenced by the expressive character design of classic anime. Its gorgeous world feels like Blade Runner infused with Cowboy Bebop, in the best possible way. I love how none of the characters in Transistor fall into typical video game or science fiction conventions. Your hero Red is a lounge singer whose voice has been stolen as a part of a nefarious plot; Her partner in crime is a talking sword that acts as your chorus. Even the strange cabal of enemies have their own motivations that keep things from becoming black and white. By the end of a few boss battles, I felt genuine remorse when I had to lay the killing blow.', 'Transistor starts in the middle of the action, and its up to you to piece together whats happened before, and whats to come. It respects your ability to fill in the blanks, and relies on subtlety in a way that few games ever do. Music is also intrinsic in Transistors DNA. From Reds former profession, to the various concert halls you visit along your adventure, to the incredible music that uses both a score as well as songs that exist inside the game world itself, Transistor is infused with the spirit of jazz. Even small actions, like being able to stop and have Red hum along to whatever song is currently playing is a creative, and evocative way of tying music to the core gameplay.', 'For as gorgeous as Transistor is, the combat shines just as brightly. The battle mechanics are some of the most rewarding Ive played in years. This is thanks in part to your ability to freeze time and plan out a series of moves. Once youve locked in your choices, restarting time and watching the success or folly of your actions never gets old. Watching Red freeze the world, teleport behind an enemy, slice them up with a series of melee attacks, then quickly teleport away before delivering a crushing energy spear never gets old. Transistor marries the quick reactions necessary in an action game with the careful planning of a strategy game in a really amazing way.', 'Leveling up generally allows you to choose between a pair of skills, like deadly spears or more defensive abilities like temporary stealth. But Transistors real depth comes from the fact that each ability can be used actively, passively, or to augment and strengthen another skill. For example, a grenade-like skill can be used  as an active weapon, or makes enemies explode when you poke them with your lance, or to provide status buffs to your character.', 'Transistor encourages experimentation and combat mastery by giving you tidbits of backstory as you use different combinations of abilities, and by allowing you to fully respec your character at any checkpoint. Alongside this, youre also able to enter magical doors that transport you to your own personal beachside cabana that allows you to escape the ever-growing insanity of the outside world. It gives you a moment to take a breather, play through a series of challenge rooms, listen to the incredible soundtrack, and play with a strong contender for cutest digital dog of 2014.', 'My only gripe with combat comes from the lack of camera control. Buildings in the foreground have a tendency to block small slices of battle arenas, and the last thing you want in the middle of a tense fight is to lose sight of your character. Though this only happened a few times throughout the campaign, it was enough to take me out of the experience on each occasion.', 'The PlayStation 4 and PC versions are nearly identical save for one feature: On PS4, you can choose to have the swords voice come out of the speaker on the controller. While it seems gimmicky on paper, I found myself playing through the entire game this way, and really appreciating the immersion it added to my experience.']",IGN
281,Wolfenstein: The New Order,19-May-14,Colin Moriarty,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/19/wolfenstein-the-new-order-review,"['""What if the Nazis won World War II?"" is probably the single most-asked alternate history question, and it makes sense why. Wars are often fought over conflicting viewpoints, opposite goals, and a muddy sense of what\'s right and wrong, but when it came to the Third Reich, the world saw the face of actual evil through its Master Race propaganda, expansionist military campaigns, and systematic extermination of millions upon millions of people.', ""But not all alternate history World War II shooters are cut from quality cloth (I'm looking at you, Turning Point: Fall of Liberty). Wolfenstein: The New Order is a fun game not because it takes place in a well-worn, fictional Nazi-controlled future, but because it does something fresh with the subject matter. Its barrage of Swastikas, Iron Crosses, and Sig Runes is the stuff of many like-minded first-person shooters; its content is something entirely different, even if its core gameplay isn't."", ""In The New Order, Nazi Germany didn't only win World War II; it completely dominates the globe. By 1960, the Nazis are everywhere, laying waste to their remaining opponents while cleansing the impure from society. Walking into a setting I've seen so many times before, I didn't expect the high level of polish applied to Wolfenstein's exceptional writing. Cutscenes are especially riddled with little touches that made them more believable -- the twirling of a character's thumbs as he speaks, the subtle ashing of a cigarette, the nuance of rolled eyes -- and there are relatable heroes to pull for and devilish villains to wish the worst upon alike."", ""The Wolfenstein series' longtime hero -- BJ Blazcowicz -- returns, though he's deeper, better written, and more fleshed-out than he's ever been. You catch a glimpse of him 14 years before the events of the main campaign in a shockingly weak intro sequence that takes forever to put an actual gun in your hand, and at that point, he's more unrelenting meathead than poet laureate. But when you fast-forward to 1960, Blazcowicz is older and smarter, hardened by his experiences in the post-war, Nazi-controlled world. You get to see an interesting side to him that makes it easy to become invested in his journey, and he's not the only character who's worth noting, either. Virtually everyone around him -- from the fiendish General Deathshead to the brave Caroline Becker -- also command attention. Wolfenstein's bloody brutality, especially when it comes to those Blazcowicz loves, only makes it easier to be sympathetic."", ""The New Order plays and runs well, though you'll encounter occasional texture pop-in and some poor audio mixing that frustratingly drowns out some well-acted voices. It's pretty, too, both in-game and during cutscenes, especially when you get a chance to marvel at some of its open vistas and cityscapes. Neo-Berlin is frighteningly beautiful in its order and grandeur, yet quainter, picturesque moments can also be found out in the wilderness, for instance when Blazcowicz escapes from a hospital in Poland early in the campaign and gets his first look at the blue sky in 14 years."", '', 'Is that a metal dog? Why yes. Yes it is.', ""Then again, when it comes to mechanics, The New Order doesn't do much to differentiate itself from the glut of shooters that come out every year. Blazcowicz has a typical array of weapons at his disposal -- a knife, a pistol, a machinegun, a sniper rifle, and so on -- as well as some Nazi future tech, like laser rifles, that give the game the alternate history feel that Wolfenstein has thrived on for 22 years. Gunplay is fun and fluid, though I have to question the inclusion of dual-wielding, which, while cool in theory, is exceptionally cumbersome and entirely inadequate in heated firefights."", ""Combat is made more dynamic by a heavy emphasis on stealth, which is both a blessing and a curse in The New Order. Slinking around wide-open maps and linear corridors -- knife in hand -- is satisfying, especially when you score a stealthy kill with a slash or toss of your blade or the shot of a silenced pistol. I also enjoyed the inclusion of special enemies with the ability to call endless reinforcements if you're spotted. By finding and killing them in secret, you can mitigate the challenges presented by specific areas while illuminating the locations of secret items on your map (like gold, Enigma codes, and letters). It's just a shame that these stealth mechanics expose some questionable and inconsistent AI that seems designed to make things a bit easier on you if you opt to play with a quiet slant. Sometimes it seems blind, both to you and to the freshly knifed bodies of their compatriots under their feet."", ""Developer Machinegames did bring some novelty to the experience, however, especially when it comes to The New Order's skill progression system. It isn't based on leveling up or spending skill points; rather, dozens of skills are nestled underneath four separate headers, and they're unlocked by completing tasks in-game, like scoring headshots, killing foes from cover, or eliminating your enemies with potato masher grenades. Better yet, many of these skills must be unlocked in sequence, giving the entire scheme some depth. I really liked this system; it feels genuinely unique next to many of Wolfenstein's shooter contemporaries."", ""The New Order has a wide array of environments to explore that highlight some what-ifs of a victorious Nazi Germany. In Wolfenstein, the Nazis have a thriving space program, devastating ordnance, and an all-new, gilded version of their capital city, Berlin. Some of these areas seem a little vacant when it comes to foot and car traffic, but it's cool to see Machinegames' vision of this terrible new fascist-dominated world. Unfortunately, scouring these environments can sometimes be a bit of a grind, especially when you're constantly collecting endless amounts of health, armor, and ammunition, each of which requiring the press of a button. Oftentimes, I'd see the on-screen prompt to collect something before I could even see what I'm collecting, taking away from the immersive nature of the world. Why can't I just pick up the ammo by walking over it? This aspect of The New Order made it feel very old."", '', 'The Nazis have been inventing some pretty crazy machines...', ""Where The New Order really shines, however, is in its plot, characters, and presentation. It's swimming in cool, alternate history lore that makes Wolfenstein feel strangely believable. While the Nazis didn't actually build large, building-sized machines, affix plate armor to their dogs, or implant human brains into mechs, it's honestly not that far-fetched to think they might have tried if the Allies didn't extinguish them in 1945. These are the people that performed heinous experiments on living humans, obsessed over racial purity with their Ahnenerbe-affiliated pseudo-scholars, and even contemplated building something called the Sun Gun, not to mention endless arrays of special missiles, nuclear bombs, jet aircraft, helicopters, and more under the moniker of Wunderwaffe. That's all real, so it's not too farfetched to think that if Nazi scientists in the real world were experimenting with, say, bone and nerve transplants, that they might have eventually tried to do it with the human brain, too. Wolfenstein seems to understand this, even if it's taken to a still unrealistic degree."", ""Machinegames should also be commended for artfully working unsanitized references to real-life Nazi atrocities into its alternate history story without fear of offending anybody. You're given startling glimpses into Nazi's systematic mistreatment of the mentally ill and handicapped, a first-hand look at a forced labor camp, and plenty of allusions to Nazi treatment of non-Aryan people around the world, including in occupied America. All of this, peppered into in-game and pre-rendered cutscenes, makes The New Order feel surprisingly human, and your situation quite desperate."", '', '', 'The so-called ""last-gen"" iterations of Wolfenstein: The New Order -- on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 -- are identical in content to the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC versions of the game. They play virtually identically, too. However, there are a few technical issues and hiccups worth noting.', 'The New Order on both PS3 and Xbox 360 looks noticeably rougher compared to their next-gen counterparts. No surprise there. Additionally, both have texture pop-in issues, issues which are especially noticeable in tight spaces (like during the intro sequence, for instance).', 'On PlayStation 3, I had to install the game on two separate machines. On the first PS3 I tried (a ""fat"" model), the game didn\'t contain any spoken audio. I uninstalled and reinstalled the game; the same thing happened. On the second PS3 I installed it on (also a ""fat"" model), it worked fine. So, this is likely due to hardware, but it\'s worth noting, nonetheless.', 'Both the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions require substantial installs, so make sure to clear around 10 gigs of space on your console. And while the PlayStation 3 version is on a single Blu-ray disc, the Xbox 360 iteration is on four separate discs, which seems a little excessive, to put it lightly.', '', '']",IGN
